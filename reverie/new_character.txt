  "age": 32,
  "innate": "curious, detail-oriented, social",
  "learned": "Caleb Thornton has developed a deep knowledge of bourbon and scotch collecting. He knows the value of rare bottles, tracks loyalty points systems like Total Wine‚Äôs, and often organizes small gatherings where he shares his collection. Although he loves the hunt, Caleb is also aware of his spending habits and tries to balance indulgence with responsibility.",
  "currently": "Status: Caleb recently realized he spent over $3,000 on whiskey in 2022, including a bourbon trail trip where he picked up bottles directly from distilleries. While part of the stash was shared with his local cigar-and-whiskey club, most was for his own collection. He‚Äôs both proud of his shelves of Eagle Rare, Weller, and Glenmorangie Signet, and slightly uneasy about the budget hit. His resolution for 2023 is to slow down purchases until at least half the cabinet is empty.",
  "lifestyle": "Caleb usually goes to bed around 11:30 pm and wakes at 6:30 am. He budgets carefully but allows himself room for hobby spending, especially when rare bottles appear. Social drinking is central ‚Äî he hosts tastings, brings bottles to neighborhood groups, and gifts whiskey for special occasions.",
