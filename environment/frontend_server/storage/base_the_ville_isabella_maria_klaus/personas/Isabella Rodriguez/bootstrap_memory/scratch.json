  "learned": "Isabella Rodriguez has developed a deep knowledge of bourbon and scotch collecting. She knows the value of rare bottles, tracks loyalty points systems like The Willows Market's, and often organizes small gatherings where she shares her collection. Although she loves the hunt, Isabella is also aware of her spending habits and tries to balance indulgence with responsibility.", 
  "currently": "Status: Isabella recently realized she spent over $3,000 on whiskey in 2022, including a bourbon trail trip where she picked up bottles directly from distilleries. While part of the stash was shared with her local whiskey club at The Rose and Crown Pub, most was for her own collection. She's both proud of her shelves of Eagle Rare, Weller, and Glenmorangie Signet, and slightly uneasy about the budget hit. Her resolution for 2023 is to slow down purchases until at least half the cabinet is empty.", 
  "lifestyle": "Isabella Rodriguez usually goes to bed around 12:30 am and wakes at 6:00 am. She budgets carefully but allows herself room for hobby spending, especially when rare bottles appear. Social drinking is central ‚Äî she hosts tastings at The Rose and Crown Pub, brings bottles to neighborhood groups, and gifts whiskey for special occasions.",
