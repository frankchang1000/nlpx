treatment. I-Health
Inpatient, O

I've B-Health

I'm O

it’s O

[SEP]
[SEP]
now, O
I B-Health
have I-Health
psoriasis, I-Health
it’s O
not O
majorly O
bad O
or O
anything. O
It O
only O
affections O
certain O
spots O
on O
my O
body O
and O
comes O
and O
goes. O
So O
sometimes O
it’s O
basically O
gone O
and O
other O
times O
im O
like O
a O
greggs O
sausage O
roll, O
pissing O
flakes O
as O
I O

[SEP]
[SEP]
lately, O
it’s O
been O
bad, O
getting O
worse, O
the O
main O
places O
are O
on O
my O
V-line O
and O
right O
in O
between O
my O
boobs O
(And O
my O
hairline O
but O
that’s O
not O
important) O
But O
I B-Appearance
recently I-Appearance
got I-Appearance
another I-Appearance
little I-Appearance
spot I-Appearance
right I-Appearance
on I-Appearance
my I-Appearance
nipple I-Appearance
and I-Appearance
on I-Appearance
the I-Appearance
side I-Appearance
of I-Appearance
my I-Appearance
boobs. I-Appearance
im O
so O
incredibly O
insecure O
about O
it O
Because O
it O
looks O
like O
I’ve O
got O
some O
disgusting O
contagious O
disease. O
(Sorry O
to O
anyone O
else O
who O
has O
psoriasis O
no O

[SEP]
[SEP]
when O
me O
and O
him O
first O
started O
being O
intimate O
it O
was O
barely O
noticeable, O
but O
I’m O
way O
more O
stressed O
and O
now O
it’s O
worse O
and O
I O
straight O
up O
avoid O
being O
intimate O
(where O
I O
have O
to O
take O
off O
my O

anyway) O
and O
he’s O
started O
to O

[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
know O
whether O
to O

just O
say O
I’m O

it O

tell O

he’d O
be O

away O

this O

close O

so, O

[SEP]
I O
actually O
did O
great O

I O
made O
conscious O
effort O
to O
not O
drink O
as O
much O
this O

and O
money O
has O
been O
tight O
all O

I O
bought O
an O
Eagle O
Rare O
and O
Buffalo O
Trace O
for O
a O
total O
of O
$50 O
on O
base. O
I O
bought O
a O
little O
bottle O
of O
Jim O
Beam O
to O
sneak O
into O
a O
concert. O
[SEP]
I'd O
guess O
about O
$1000- O
$1200 O
[SEP]
I'd O
guess O
about O
$2K. O
Most O
of O
these O
were O
hard O
to O
find O
and/or O
stocking O
up O
on O
favorites O
that O
are O
hard O
to O
find O
in O
my O

[SEP]
I O
am O
pleading O
the O
fifth O
on O
this O
one O
[SEP]
About O
3k. O
But O
half O
of O
that O
is O
because O
I O
buy O
for O
my O
neighborhood O
cigar O
and O
bourbon O
group O
which O
spends O
about O
$150 O
a O
month O
on O
cigars O
and O
$150 O
on O
cigars. O
[SEP]
Probably O
$300 O
or O
so O
for O
myself O
and O
$150 O
in O
gifted O
bottles. O
If O
we’re O
talking O
booze O
in O
general O
that O
number’s O
gonna O
be O
sufficiently O
higher. O
[SEP]
Probably O
only O
about O
$400-500. O
Of O
course, O
that’s O
conveniently O
leaving O
out O
our O
yearly O
trip O
to O
Kentucky O
but O
I’d O
rather O
not O
think O
about O
that. O
[SEP]
Too O
much O
yet O
not O
enough. O
[SEP]
I'm O
about O
there O
too O
[SEP]
I O

Don’t O

Less O

We O
hardly O

Once O
I O
found O
a O
spot O
that O
had O
the O
good O
stuff O
for O
good O
prices O
I O
started O
buying O
a O
lot O
more O
than O
normal O
so O
I O
could O
try O
a O
lot O
bourbons. O
A O
few O
JD, O
a O
couple O
Makers, O
EC, O
ER, O
Rowan’s, O
Noah’s, O
willet, O
bookers, O
buff O
trace, O
Weller, O
blantons.. O
easily O
over O
1k O
closer O
to O
2k O
this O
year. O
And O
probably O
$150 O
a O
week O
on O
wine O
plus O
beer. O
So O
maybe O
23 O
… O
aim O
for O
less O
lol O
[SEP]
I O
could O
work O
it O
out, O
but O
then O
I O

about O

a O

more, O

honestly O
I’m O
not O

anymore O
until O
half O
the O

[SEP]
Around O
6-7k O
this O

A O
few O
big O

bumped O
that O
up O
much O
higher O
than O
a O

I O
just O
couldn’t O
pass O
on O
some O
of O
them. O
[SEP]
Between O
$1K O
- O
2K. O
Hell, O
the O
one O
bottle O
of O
KC O
18y O
was O
close O
to O
$200 O
after O
taxes. O
[SEP]
I’m O
not O
sure O
exactly O
the O
number, O
especially O
if O
it’s O
counting O
my O
bourbon O

I’d O
probably O
guess O
(including O
that) O
3-4K O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
I O
don’t O
include O
that O
probably O
2K O
[SEP]
$1,200 O
[SEP]
Too O

I O

3 O

some O

5 O

[SEP]
10-15k O
with O
6 O

1k O

I O

5-6 O
Lagavulin O
16, O
3 O
Talisker O
18, O
Glenmorangie O
Signet, O
some O
Macallan, O

I O
went O
from O
5,000 O

to O
30,000 O
of O
a O
few O

[SEP]
Do O
those O

anything? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Have O
you O
gotten O
any O
of O
the O

(Stagg O

you O

Damn O
you O

[SEP]
$5k O
in O

If O
I O
was O
to O
guess, O
around O
40-50 O
bottles? O
[SEP]
Maybe O
two O
fifths. O
I O
swear, O
no O
more O
than O
three O

Or O
four(ty) O
[SEP]
60k O
in O

[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
a O
guy O
who O
had O
collection O
of O
open O
and O
unopened O
bottles O
worth O
$75k. O
But O
that O
was O
over O
10 O
years O
of O
buying. O
I O
am O
sure O
this O
dude O
maybe O
drinking O
close O
to O
$10k O
in O
a O
year O
since O
his O
avg O
bottle O
price O
was O
around O
$150. O
[SEP]
That’s O
right, O
it’s O
all O
relative. O
It’s O
all O
relative. O
It’s O
all O
relative. O
[SEP]
Unless O
you O
spent O
$2k O
that O
month O
I’m O
pretty O
sure O
you O
lucked O
out O
on O
a O
glitch O
in O
the O
system O
[SEP]
Yes O
I O
bought O
in O
October O
but O
I O
didn't O
see O
a O
bump O
like O
that O
[SEP]
Nah O
their O
point O
system O
is O
wack. O
They O
do O
Pappy O
and O
BTAC O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year. O
I O
believe O
OFBB. O
Not O
sure O
what O
the O
other O
2 O
drawings O
are. O
I O
know O
you O
can O
randomly O
be O
selected O
to O
purchase O
blantons O
but O
everything O
else O
is O
thrown O
on O
the O
shelf O
so O
it’s O
all O
about O
being O
at O
the O
right O
place O
at O
the O
right O
time. O
They O
put O
out O
OWA, O
EHT, O
Stagg O
Picks O
over O
the O
last O
few O
months O
at O
our O
location. O
[SEP]
Probably O
somewhere O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
but O
my O
per O
bottle O
got O
a O
bit O
higher O
this O
year O
as O
well. O
Glenmorangie O
signet, O
MWND, O
Bardstown O
Discovery, O
etc. O
[SEP]
That’s O
a O
Monopoly O

card O
IRL O
[SEP]
Nah O
they O
have O
2x, O
5x, O
and O
10x O
on O
points O
that O
month. O
Didn’t O
pay O
attention O
but O
mostly O
bourbon, O
seasonal O
beers, O
and O
wine O
bought. O
Probably O
spent O
$400 O
in O
bourbon O
only. O
[SEP]
Bardstown O
is O
a O
cool O
story. O
I O
stopped O
by O
there O
just O
recently O
for O

a O

I O

Good O
on O
you O
for O
looking O
out O
for O
your O
coworkers, O
any O
time O
management O
tries O
to O
discourage O
you O
from O
talking O
about O
your O
wages O
its O
a O
sign O
that O
*you O
need O
to O
start O
talking O
about O
them O
asap.* O
It's O
the O
only O
way O
to O
uncover O
and O
address O
things O
like O
say O
systemic O
racism O
in O
your O
company's O
hiring O
system O
leading O
to O
specific O
ethnicities O
getting O
lower O
pay. O
You O
can't O
figure O
that O
out O
unless O
the O
workers O
talk O
to O
each O
other O
and O
find O
the O
pattern. O
[SEP]
You O
could O
show O
your O

the O

it- O
it’s O
pretty O
good, O
and O
utterly O
hilarious. O
[SEP]
We O
had O
good O
chuckle O
about O
the O
"sexism" O
in O
my O
office O
the O
other O
day. O
Every O
male O
who O
works O
for O
the O
company O
has O
a O
company O
truck. O
None O
of O
the O
females O
have O
any O
kind O
of O
company O
vehicle O
at O
all. O
Seems O
sexist O
on O
the O
surface. O
But O
we O
are O
an O
industrial O
service O
company O
and O
every O
technician O
is O
male O
(literally O
never O
had O
a O
female O
apply O
for O
a O
tech O
position). O
Every O
office O
support O
person O
is O
female, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
president O
of O
the O
company. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Just O
because O
you O
uncover O
a O
"pattern" O
doesn't O
mean O
there O
isn't O
a O
legitimate O
reason O
for O
it. O
There O
may O
be O
illegitimate O
reasons, O
and O
those O
should O
be O
addressed. O
But O
don't O
be O
too O
quick O
to O
jump O
to O
conclusions. O
[SEP]
If O
they O
only O
hire O
men O
as O
technicians, O
and O
only O
hire O
women O
as O
office O
workers, O
that O
is O
most O
definitely O
a O
strong O
sign O
of O
a O
sexist O
hiring O
pattern. O
What O
legitimate O
reason O
is O
there O
for O
that? O
There O
are O
strong O
gender O
biases O
in O
both O
professions O
but O
an O
unbiased O
hiring O
process O
would O
reflect O
the O
actual O
gender O
percentages O
of O
the O
professions, O
not O
an O
absolute O
monolith. O
For O
both O
professions O
it's O
about O
75% O
dominated O
by O
one O
gender, O
so O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
25% O
of O
applicants O
that O
are O
the O
"wrong" O
gender? O
Why O
do O
they O
not O
make O
up O
25% O
of O
your O
workforce? O
[SEP]
Now, O
I O
once O
flunked O
algebra O
in O
high O
school… O
but O
how O
do O
you O
hire O
women O
when O
100% O
of O
your O
applicants O
are O
male? O
[SEP]
You O
don't, O
but O
again, O
25% O
of O
technicians O
are O
women. O
If O
you O
get O
zero O
female O
applicants O
for O
a O
technician O
position O
rather O
than O
25% O
that O
indicates O
a O
bias O
in O
the O
hiring/application O
process O
or O
perhaps O
some O
kind O
of O
external O
factor O
like O
a O
poor O
company O
reputation. O
This O
isn't O
so O
bad O
in O
its O
own O
and O
might O
just O
be O
random O
coincidence O
but O
not O
when O
it O
happens O
twice O
in O
one O
workplace. O
That's O
pushing O
the O
bounds O
of O
believability. O
Note O
also O
that O
he O
only O
specifies O
that O
for O
the O
technician O
position- O
men O
*do* O
apply O
for O
office O
positions, O
but O
don't O
ever O
get O
hired. O
Why O
could O
that O
be? O
When O
this O
is O
a O
company-wide O
problem O
rather O
than O
a O
departmental O
one O
that O
points O
to O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
company O
culture, O
likely O
sexism. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Overall, O
just O
weird O
to O
notice O
the O
issue O
but O
laugh O
it O
off O
instead O
of O
pursuing O
it O
further. O
[SEP]
Yeah.... O
If O
I O
had O
one O
female O
applicant O
for O
a O
tech O
position, O
she O
would O
be O
given O
the O
same O
consideration O
as O
a O
male O
applicant. O
This O
isn't O
a O
phenomenon O
isolated O
to O
one O
company. O
I've B-Occupation
been I-Occupation
in I-Occupation
the I-Occupation
industrial I-Occupation
service I-Occupation
industry I-Occupation
my B-Time
entire I-Time
adult I-Time
life I-Time
(I'm B-Age
41, I-Age
so O
that's B-Occupation
about I-Occupation
23 I-Occupation
years I-Occupation
in I-Occupation
the I-Occupation
industry) I-Occupation
and O
have O
worked O
for O
a O
number O
of O
different O
companies, O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
country. O
It's O
the O
same O
everywhere. O
Females O
tend O
not O
to O
apply O
for O
Technician O
positions. O
The O
strange O
this O
is O
(or O
maybe O
not O
so O
stramge) O
that O
this O
disparity O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
bother O
the O
female O
support O
staff O
we O
have. O
They O
are O
not O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
concerned O
with O
the O
lack O
of O
female O
representation O
amongst O
the O
service O
techs. O
The O
only O
people O
concerned O
are O
outside O
the O
industry, O
which O
really O
baffles O
me. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now, O
if O
you O
would O
like O
to O
enlighten O
me O
as O
to O
how O
I O
am O

qualified O

who O
are O

I O

[SEP]
[SEP]
While O
I O
enjoy O
the O
story O
that O

my O

wanes O
based O
on O
how O
much O

my O

(also, O
is O

I O
also O
want O
to O
get O
more O

people O
to O
view O

[SEP]
[SEP]
At O
the O
same O
time, O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
spread O
my O

how O

You O
can O
join O
Discord O
servers, O
subreddits O
or O
other O
communities O
for O
fanfic O
readers O

writers O
in O

Pay O
attention O
to O
any O
requests O
people O
might O
make O
(i.e. O
"I O
want O
to O
read O

and O
share O
your O

if O
it O
fits O
the O
request. O
Talk O
about O
what O
you're O
writing O
if O
it's O
appropriate O
to O
the O
conversation. O
However, O
you O
should O
obviously O
engage O
with O
other O
people O
in O
the O
community O
for O
purposes O
other O
than O
self-promotion. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
it's O
normal O
for O
your O
motivation O
to O
fluctuate O
with O
your O
engagement O
levels. O
It O
doesn't O
make O
you O
weak O
or O
inferior O
to O
writers O
who O
don't O
care O
as O
much O
about O
external O

[SEP]
There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
you O
can O
do O
that O
aren't O
super O
in O
your O
face. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
first O
the O
more O
sites O
you O
post O
on O
the O
more O
folks O
can O
read O
your O
work O
but O
it O
can O
bug O
you O
if O
your O
wanting O
all O
your O
readers O
centralized O
in O
one O
spot. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Second O
talk O
about O
your O
fic O
in O
appropriate O
context, O
fandom O
discussions O
about O
fanfic, O
on O
your O
social O
media O
and O
participate O
in O
review O
exchanges O
and O
other O
things O
designed O
for O
drumming O
up O
interest O
on O
this O
and O
other O
subs. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Three O
be O
active O
in O
your O
fandom O
by O
reviewing O
and O
interacting O
with O
others O
fics. O
Don't O
shill O
your O
own O
fic O
that's O
just O
irritating O
but O
the O
fact O
you O
interacted O
will O
often O
lead O
to O
folks O
clicking O
your O
user O
name O
to O
see O
what O
you O
have O
written O
and O
some O
of O
them O
will O
probably O
be O
interested. O
[SEP]
Best O
way O
is O
to O
interact O
with O
other O
people O
in O
your O
fandom, O
and O
to O
share O
your O
stories O
in O
spaces O
that O
are O
yours, O
or O
where O
advertising O
is O
allowed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Post O
about O
it O
on O
your O
social O
media O
and O
tag O
correctly O
based O
on O
the O
rules O
for O
whatever O
platform O
you're O
using. O
That O
isn't O
seen O
as O
annoying, O
because O
you O
are O
allowed O
to O
post O
whatever O
content O
to O
your O
own O
blog, O
as O
long O
as O
you're O
doing O
it O
within O
reason. O
If O
you're O
reblogging O
other O
people's O
works O
and O
commenting O
on O
them O
and O
just O
being O
active O
in O
the O
community, O
then O
advertising O
your O
stuff O
will O
be O
seen O
as O
adding O
to O
the O
community O
too, O
rather O
than O
shilling. O
Remember O
that O
within O
your O
fandom O
there O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
market O
for O
your O
stuff. O
You O
just O
have O
to O
put O
your O
stuff O
out O
there O
naturally O
and O
let O
*them* O
find O
it, O
rather O
than O
shoving O
it O
under O
everyone's O
noses. O
[SEP]
Do O
you O
cross-post O
to O
AO3, O
and O
any O
fandom-specific O
archives O
(assuming O
there O
are O
any)? O
Cross-posting O
can O
get O
more O
eyes O
on O
your O
page. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Promote O
in O
the O
places O
where O
it's O
appropriate. O
On O
this O
subreddit, O
that O
would O
be O
Friday's O
Weekly O
Fic O
Showcase. O
Some O
threads O
let O
you O
post O
excerpts O
("Show O
me O
your O
funniest O
scene," O
"What's O
your O
most O
romantic O

A O

of O

may O
get O
someone O
interested. O
If O
you O
put O
your O
FFN O
and/or O
AO3 O
username O
in O
your O

an O

can O
go O

up O
your O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Other O
fanfiction O
subreddits O
like O
r/AO3 O
also O
have O
designated O
self-promo O
threads, O
although O
that O
sub O
is O
probably O
for O
AO3 O
users. O
(Another O
reason O
to O
cross-post.) O
[SEP]
With O
the O
caveats O
that O
a) O
it's O
hard O
to O
tell O
where O
your O
readers O
are O
coming O
from O
and O
b) O
you'll O
never O
fully O
know O
whether O
your O
promotion O
of O
your O
fic O
= O
more O
readers, O
as O
others O
have O
said: O
post O
links O
to O
the O
fic O
in O
the O
appropriate O
places O
of O
fannish O
spaces O
in O
your O
fandom, O
wherever O
they O
are. O
Be O
matter-of-fact O
about O
it O
and O
don't O
beg. O
I O
usually O
do O
something O
like, O
"Hey, O
I O
posted O
a O
new O
fic, O
here's O
the O
link, O
go O
read!" O
and O
then O
leave O
it O
and O
let O
it O
go. O

The O
thing O
about O
AO3 O
is O
that O
I O
really O
just O
don't O
like O
it. O
Nothing O
against O
those O
who O
post O
there, O
I O
just O
prefer O
FFN. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
yeah O
I'll O
post O
on O
threads O
like O
that O
and O
I'll O
promote O
on O
the O

Thanks O
for O

What O
makes O
this O
difficult O
is O
that O
my O
story O
is O
a O
crossover, O
so O
it O
can O
be O
hard O
to O
market O
it O
to O
people O
since O
many O
of O
them O
are O
only O
interested O
in O
one O
fandom O
or O
the O
other. O
That, O
along O
with O
the O
crossovers O
being O
separated O
from O
the O
main O
stories O
means O
that O
my O
fix O
is O
essentially O
hidden O
from O
readers O
who O
don't O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
look O
for O
that O
specific O
crossover O
category. O
It's O
frustrating. O
[SEP]
I O
write O
crossovers. O
I O
agree O
it’s O
twice O
as O
difficult O
than O
if O
you O
stick O
to O
a O
single O
fandom, O
but O
only O
in O
the O
sense O
you O
have O
to O
do O
twice O
the O
work. O
People O
read O
crossovers, O
especially O
this O
time O
of O
year O
when O
holiday O
challenges O
often O
incorporate O
them. O
Don’t O
let O
your O
perceived O
lack O
of O
audience O
stop O
you O
from O
promoting O
your O
fic. O
Someone O
will O
read O
it, O
trust O
me. O
It O
may O
not O
be O
two O
minutes O
from O
now, O
but O
speaking O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
posting O
fanfic O
since O
1998: O
someone O
will. O
[SEP]
I'm O
going O
to O
keep O
writing, O
I O
have O
too O
many O
ideas O
and O
I'm O
still O
interested O
in O
exploring O
my O
world O
further, O
it's O
just O
disheartening. O

Was O
it O
really O
that O
bad? O
[SEP]
A O
girl O
was O
interested O
in O
me O
during O
lab. O
I O
got O
her O
number, O
and O
we O
started O
texting O
and O
hanging O
out. O
We O
were O
clearly O
into O
each O
other O
as O
she O
was O
hinting, O
saying, O
"All O
my O
past O
boyfriends O
were O
Gemini, O
and O
it's O
crazy O
that O
I O
don't O
give O
Gemini O
vibes." O
She O
knew O
I B-Relationship_Status
had I-Relationship_Status
never I-Relationship_Status
dated I-Relationship_Status
before I-Relationship_Status
and O
was O
inexperienced. O
I O
made O
one O
mistake O
by O
just O
wishing O
her O
a O
happy O
birthday O
but O
not O
bringing O
her O
a O
gift. O
I O
only O
knew O
her O
for O
a O
month. O
I O
felt O
horrible O
and O
apologized. O
But O
she O
moved O
on O
and O
went O
to O
another O
guy. O
I O
feel O
horrible O
and O
can O
barely O
move O
on. O
Did O
I O
mess O
up O
that O
bad? O

[SEP]
It’s O
the O
first O
relationship, O
it O
will O
hurt O
forsure. O
You O
didn’t O
do O
anything O
wrong, O
she O
doesn’t O
have O
great O
communication O
skills, O
so O
a O
great O
thing O
for O
you O
to O
work O
on O
moving O
forward, O

It’s O
a O

Hope O
you O

in O

it O

I O
don't O
think O
astrology O
talk O
is O
cause O
for O
running, O
unless O
it O
dominates O
conversation. O
BUT, O
her O
moving O
on O
because O
you O
didn't O
bring O
a O
gift O
is. O
She's O
spoiled O
. O
She O
obviously O
has O
her O
expectations O
of O
a O
guy O
and O
that O
is O
monetary O
and O
superficial. O
You O
didn't O
meet O
that O
requirement O
so O
she O
moved O
on. O
Thank O
God O
for O
this. O
Real O
relationships O
can O
be O
hopeful O
for O
gifts O
but O
grateful O
for O
time O
and O
energy O
spent O
with O
them. O
Truthfully O
the O
way O
to O
show O
you O
care. O
[SEP]
Don't O
let O
your O
lack O
of O
experience O
make O
you O

that O
you O
have O
to O
put O
up O
with O
unreasonable O
demands O
or O
expectations, O
it O
doesn't. O
[SEP]
Na O
you O
didn’t O
do O
anything O
wrong O
and O
for O
her O
to O
be O
expected O
a O
gift O
after O
only O
knowing O
each O
other O
for O
30 O
days O
that’s O
crazy. O
Also O
so O
just O
moved O
on O
to O
the O
next O
guy O
yeah O
she O
probably O
was O
already O
talking O
to O
him O
as O
well. O
[SEP]
I O
doubt O
it O
was O
because O
of O
this O
[SEP]
Dude. O
She’s O
nothing. O
Idk O
who O
expects O
a O
birthday O
presents O
after O
knowing O
someone O
for O
a O
month. O
But O
that O
and O
the O
zodiac O
talk O
tell O
me O
all O
you O
need O
to O
know. O

No, O
You O

after O
1 O
month??? O

Bro, O
pick O
yourself O
up O
off O

you're O

[SEP]
Go O
find O
a O
nice O

who O
values O
you O
and O
stop O
beating O
yourself O
up. O
[SEP]
If O
a O
girls O
interest O
is O
conditioned O
to O
you O
giving O
her O
gifts, O
trust O
me O
when O
i O
say O
she O
is O
not O
interested O
in O
you O
but O
just O
on O
how O
she O
can O
use O
you. O
It’s O
toxic O
behavior O
101 O
and O
huge O
red O
flag. O
You O
did O
nothing O
wrong O
in O
this O
case, O
she O
was O
trying O
to O
use O
you O
by O
giving O
you O
false O
hopes. O
[SEP]
So O
that O
probably O
meant O
she's O
materialistic. O
You O
dodged O
a O
bullet O
[SEP]
Oh O
you O
dodged O
a O
bullet. O
She O
should O
have O
just O
been O
happy O
that O
you O
remembered O
to O
wish O
her O
a O
happy O
birthday. O
We're O
y'all O
even O
exclusive O
when O
her O
birthday O
rolled O
around O
or O
just O
still O
in O
the O
getting O
to O
knew O
each O
other O
phase? O
[SEP]
Nope, O
this O
broad O
sounds O
awful. O
You O
need O
to O
date O
other O
women O
and O
show O
what O
she O
missed. O
You O
need O
to O
delete O
everything O
you O
have O
of O
this O
woman O
and O
never O
talk O
to O
her O
again. O
She O
missed O
her O
chance. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
you're O
bad O
at O
dating O
since O
you O
stated O
it. O
But O
you O
need O
to O
date O
more O
and O
more O
and O
you O
will O
learn O
how O
to O
get O
women O
to O
respect O
you. O
For O
one O
thing, O
how O
in O
the O
hell O
would O
this O
awful O
woman O
expect O
a O
gift O
from O
you O
when O
you're O
not O
even O
dating O
her. O
Don't O
ever O
buy O
women O
any O
gifts O
unless O
you're O
in O
a O
relationship. O
If O
it O
was O
me, O
I O
wouldn't O
have O
even O
said O
happy O
birthday O
to O
her. O
If O
she O
mentioned O
it O
later, O
I O
would O
have O
just O
said O
happy O
belated O
birthday O
and O
left O
it O
at O
that O
making O
her O
wonder O
if O
I O
cared O
at O
all O
for O
her. O

Let O
me O
tell O
you O
my B-Gender
experience I-Gender
as I-Gender
a I-Gender
girl..my I-Gender
relationship I-Relationship_Status
was I-Relationship_Status
just I-Relationship_Status
a I-Relationship_Status
month I-Relationship_Status
old I-Relationship_Status
when B-Husband_BF
my I-Husband_BF
long I-Husband_BF
distance I-Husband_BF
boyfriend’s I-Husband_BF
birthday I-Husband_BF
came I-Husband_BF
up I-Husband_BF
and O
I O
sent O
him O
a O
surprise O
gift O
a O
branded O
shirt..unfortunately O
it O
wasn’t O
the O
right O
fit O
but O
after O
a O
few O
months O
I O
bought O
him O
another O
which O
was O
more O
expensive…I O
just O
wanted O
it O
to O
be O
special O
and O
moreover O
its B-Relationship_Status
our I-Relationship_Status
first I-Relationship_Status
year I-Relationship_Status
in I-Relationship_Status
relationship. I-Relationship_Status
Then O
my O
birthday O
came O
up O
he O
didn’t O
give O
me O
anything. O
I O
mean O
I O
felt O
bad…like O
really O
bad. O
I O
mean O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
didn’t O
make O
the O
smallest O
effort O
did O
upset O
me. O
It O
doesn’t O
mean O
I’m O
a O
materialistic O
person. O
It’s O
just O
the O
way O
to O
show O
someone O
that O
you O
mean O
a O
lot O
to O
them…I O
always O
treat O
people O
the O
way O
I O
want O
to O
be O
treated… O
[SEP]
Just O
to O
mention O
I’m B-Occupation
a I-Occupation
student I-Occupation
and O
saved O
my O
pocket O
money O
to O
buy O
him O
something. O
He O
has O
a O
nice O
job O
and O
salary. O
[SEP]
Anyways O
I B-Husband_BF
didn’t I-Husband_BF
leave I-Husband_BF
my I-Husband_BF
boyfriend I-Husband_BF
but O
I O
will O
never O
ever O
gift O
him O
anything O
in O
future O
that’s O
for O
sure O
… O
[SEP]
She O
clearly O
didn't O
like O
you O
that O
much O
don't O
relay O
on O
presents, O
you O
did O
it O
right O
now O
you O
see O
what O
kinda O
person O
she O
is O
[SEP]
I'm O
convinced O
some O
of O
these O
posts O
are O
a O
joke. O
[SEP]
If O
a O
chick O
starts O
spouting O
astronomy O
bullshit, O
run. O
That's O
likely O
not O
the O
completley O
irrational O
thing O
about O
her. O
[SEP]
It O
sounds O
like O
you O
guys O
might O
be O
a O
bit O
young O
and O
the O
connection O
wasn’t O
strong O
enough O
to O
continue O
on. O
I O
doubt O
her O
feelings O
completely O
shut O
down O
because O
of O
the O
gift O
thing, O
but O
maybe O
it O
was O
a O
small O
factor, O
like O
a O
straw O
that O
broke O
the O
camels O
back O
sort O
of O
thing. O
Who O
knows O
what O
she’s O
looking O
for O
in O
a O
partner. O
You’ll O
experience O
this O
at O
least O
a O
few O
times O
through O
your O
life. O
It’s O
best O
to O
mourn O
the O
loss O
but O
not O
dwell O
too O
much O
and O
move O
on O
when O
you’re O
ready. O
You’ll O
find O
someone O
else. O
[SEP]
I O
can O
see O
how O
it O
might O
have O
been O
hurtful O
from O
her O
perspective, O
as O
us B-Gender
girls I-Gender
analyze I-Gender
EVERYTHING, I-Gender
but O
that O
does O
not O
mean O
she O
should O
expect O
a O
gift. O
And O
she O
knows O
you’re O
not O
experienced—if O
I O
was O
in O
her O
position, O
I O
would O
be O
honored O
that O
someone O
trusts O
me O
enough O
to O
be O
their O
first O
SO. O
Also, O
if O
she O
just O
moved O
on O
to O
another O
guy, O
there’s O
a O
good O
chance O
she O
is O
lacking O
self-confidence O
and O
believes O
having O
a O
BF O
means O
she O
is O
“good O
enough” O
for O
someone O
else. O
I’m O
sorry O
that O
happened O
:(( O
[SEP]
Truly O
though. O
OP O
dodged O
a O
bullet O
on O
this O
one O

Indeed; O
OP O
could O
have O
been O
classy O

bought O
a O
little O
inexpensive O

cute O
token, O
with O
a O
nice O
card O
with O
something O
silly O

funny O
written, O
like O
"Happy O
birthday O
and O
10E6 O
returns" O
(if O
you O
are O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
science). O
Girls O
love O
these O
little O
things. O
Nobody, O
however, O
would O
buy O
an O
expensive O
gift O
after O
so O
little O
time O
and O
commitment O
... O
if O
she's O
really O
so O
venal, O
OP O
would O
be O
better O
without O
her. O
[SEP]
She O
went O
cold O
right O
after O
the O
incident O
that's O
why O
I'm O
guessing O
she's O
upset. O

So O
true. O
The O

shit O
alone O
is O
a O
big O

I O
don't O
know O
why O

it's O
my O

these O
emotions O

Astrology O
not O
astronomy, O

who O

are O
great. O
Just O
saying O
😁 O
[SEP]
Yes. O
He O
did. O
😅 O
[SEP]
Yeah O
she O
probably O
just O
wanted O
an O
expensive O
present O
[SEP]
Too O
many O
red O
flags. O
Brush O
yourself O
off, O
and O
ask O
more O
women O
out O
[SEP]
Just O
date O
a O
ton O
of O
other O
girls O
in O
your O
school. O
You O
have O
to O
look O
at O
it O
in O
a O
mature O
way O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
do. O
That's O
the O
whole O
point O
of O
dating O
is O
to O
find O
who O
you O
connect O
with. O
She'll O
start O
noticing O
you O
with O
other O
girls O
anyways O
not O
that O
that's O
the O
goal O
but O
she O
will O
probably O
regret. O
In O
the O
beginning O
the O
power O
of O
the O
relationship O
goes O
to O

Ive O
learned O
pinyin O
so O
far. O
Im O
not O
sure O
where O
to O
go O
from O
there? O
Grammar? O
Radicals? O
Words? O
Something O
else? O
A O
list O
of O
the O
order O
would O
be O
appreciated. O
[SEP]
nan O
[SEP]
There O
might O
be O
links O
to O
textbooks O
in O
the O
sidebar. O
Actually O
you O
could O
work O
on O
characters O
and O
grammar O
along O
both O
lines. O
[SEP]
ok O
so O
you've O
learnt O
Pinyin. O
First O
of O
all O
congratulations! O
I'm O
slightly O
ahead O
of O
you. O
I O
apparently O
know O
650 O
words O
and O
479 O
characters O
but O
i O
still O
feel O
like O
I O
barely O
know O
anything O
but O
I O
have O
a O
solid O
routine O
in O
place. O
Now O
we O
can O
go O
a O
bit O
deeper: O

**Listening** O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Imo O
this O
is O
the O
core O
skill, O
especially O
with O
Chinese O
and O
it's O
very O
different O
sounds. O
The O
problem O
is O
that O
listening O
is O
very O
frustrating O
at O
this O
level. O
Luckily O
there's O
a O
good O
podcast O
in O
ChinesePod. O
They O
have O
3 O
podcasts O
on O
Spotify. O
Beginner, O
Intermediate O
and O
Advanced. O
Within O
each O
podcast O
the O
levels O
are O
split O
even O
further. O
[See O
here O
for O
more O
details](https://support.chinesepod.com/hc/en-us/articles/203689510-Lesson-Levels-Explained). O
Basically, O
go O
to O
the O
beginner O
podcast O
and O
start O
with O
the O
Newbie O
podcasts. O
Slowly O
work O
your O
way O
up O
the O
levels O
once O
you're O
comfortable O
with O
that O
level. O
Note, O
they O
cover O
grammar O
and O
vocab O
in O
these O
lessons O
but O
obviously O
no O
Characters. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
recommend O
doing O
1/2 O
per O
day. O
Or O
more O
if O
you O
have O
tons O
of O
time. O
[SEP]

Reading O
is O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
ass O
because O
of O
the O
writing O
system. O
And O
if O
you O
want O
to O
do O
any O
serious O
reading O
you O
need O
to O
learn O
the O
characters. O
My O
recommendation O
is O
to O
download O
an O
SRS/Flashcard O
(Spaced O
Repetition O
System) O
App O
to O
slowly O
learn O
Hanzi. O
There's O
Anki, O
Pleco O
and O
Skritter. O
I O
personally O
use O
Skritter O
and O
have O
found O
great O
use O
from O
it. O
Note O
that O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O
it, O
you O
will O
need O
to O
pay. O
There O
are O
courses O
within O
it O
that O
teach O
you O
basic O
characters,radicals, O
etc O
and O
also O
lists O
from O
different O
books, O
textbooks O
and O
HSK O
Levels. O
If O
you O
go O
down O
this O
route, O
I O
recommend O
going O
through O
the O
courses O
in O
the O
following O
order: O
The O
Skritter O
Character O
Course O
-> O
Skritter O
Chinese O
101 O
-> O
100 O
Common O
Radicals O
-> O
HSK O
1. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
recommend O
learning O
5 O
new O
characters/radicals O
per O
day. O
No O
more O
than O
15/20 O
otherwise O
the O
reviews O
become O
overbearing O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**Reading** O
[SEP]
[SEP]
To O
be O
honest O
you O
can O
start O
before O
this, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
becomes O
a O
lot O
more O
palatable O
after O
getting O
through O
the O
HSK O
1 O
skritter O
deck. O
There O
are O
a O
ton O
of O
HSK O
1 O
graded O
readers. O
They O
are O
boring O
but O
with O
150 O
words O
there's O
only O
so O
much O
you O
can O
do. O
It O
will O
allow O
you O
to O
combine O
your O
character O
knowledge O
with O
reading O
actual O
texts O
and O
really O
solidify O
your O
knowledge. O
Past O
this O
I O
recommend O
the O
Mandarin O
Companion O
Series, O
Chinese O
Breeze O
Series O
and O
Rainbow O
Bridge O
Series. O
You O
can O
get O
these O
as O
physical O
copies, O
ebooks O
or O
on O
the O
app O
Pleco. O
There's O
also O
the O
app O
DU O
Chinese. O
Du O
Chinese O
has O
a O
ton O
of O
content O
which O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
for. O
There's O
a O
still O
some O
free O
content O
to O
get O
through O
so O
you O
can O
hold O
off O
paying O
until O
you O
exhaust O
the O
free O
content. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**More O
Structured O
Content/ O
Textbooks** O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
above O
is O
all O
very O
unstructured O
learning. O
If O
you O
want O
more O
structure O
then O
a O
textbook O
like O
Integrate O
Chinese O
(IC) O
or O
New O
Practical O
Chinese O
Reader O
(NPCR) O
may O
be O
for O
you O
(although O
i O
still O
recommend O
doing O
some O
separate O
listening, O
reading O
and O
character O
learning). O
I O
personally O
use O
NPCR O
but O
I O
don't O
think O
you O
can O
go O
wrong O
with O
either. O
Also O
worth O
knowing O
that O
the O
word O
lists O
for O
both O
text O
books O
can O
be O
found O
in O
Skritter. O
So O
you O
can O
add O
them O
on O
Skritter O
before O
or O
during O
when O
you O
go O
through O
them. O

Mobile O

My O
personal O
preference O
is O
SuperChinese, O
HelloChinese O
is O
similar. O
There O
are O
a O
number O
of O
other O
apps O
people O
sometimes O
recommend. O
Most O
of O
them O
should O
have O
at O
least O
some O
free O
content. O
I O
know O
both O
SuperChinese O
and O
HelloChinese O
have O
a O
pretty O
generous O
amount O
so O
you O
can O
evaluate O
them O
and O
see O
how O
you O
feel. O
[SEP]
Who O
are O
you O
learning O
with? O
This O
is O
so O
crucial, O
because O
the O
environment O
you O

in O
will O
largely O
imprint O
on O
you O
as O
the O
“personality” O

Please O

people O

really O

[SEP]
You O
don’t O
have O
to O
learn O
one O
after O
the O
other. O
Why O
not O
learn O
everything O
at O
the O
same O
time? O
Words, O
characters, O
radicals, O
grammar. O
Basically O
I O
would O
say O
focus O
on O
whichever O
one O
you O
are O
most O
interested O
in O
and O
switch O
when O
you O
get O
bored. O
Like O
for O
example, O
learning O
just O
radicals O
is O
boring. O
Constantly O
seeing O
them O

them O

[SEP]
A O

comes O
from O

made O
even O

They’re O
coming O
from O
a O

it O
us O
understandable O
that O
they O
may O
be O
overly O

(I O

[SEP]
I'd O
say O
a O

yes, O

before O
I O
started O
it O
I O
was O
also O
dealing O

a O
LOT O
of O
sensitivity O
in O
my O
armpits O
that O
made O
using O
any O

impossible. O
It O
was O
really O
frustrating O

for O
awhile O
I O
couldn't O
put O
anything O
on O
my O
armpits O
at O
all O
without O
them O
getting O
irritated O
immediately, O
I O
could O
only O
gently O
wash O
them O
with O
water O

use O
my O

to O
apply O
a O
gentle O
soap. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
After O
leaving O
them O
alone O
for O
what O
felt O

forever O
I O
started O

Lume O

that O
worked O
really O
well O

me. O
Now O
I've B-Health
been I-Health

I O
do O

I O

more O

I've O
tried O
to O
experiment O
again O
with O
other O
deodorants O

antiperspirants O
but O
the O
only O
ones O
that O
are O
non O
irritating O
are O
Lume O
products. O
It's O
a O
bit O
expensive O
compared O
to O
what O
I O
could O
buy O
in O

but O
it's O
been O
the O

solution O
I've O
found O
that O
helps O

when O
she O
texted O
him O
"happy O
holidays" O
during O
the O
holidays. O
They O
dated O
briefly O
again O
at O
the O
end O
of O
2018, O
which O
was O
about O
7 O
months O
before O
he O
and O
I O
got O
together. O
He O
told O
me O
that O
they O
wanted O
different O
things O
and O
just O
didn't O
work O
out O
as O
romantic O
partners. O
He O
was O
hung O
up O
on O
her O
throughout O
his O
entire O
young O
adult O
life O
and O
couldn't O
forget O
about O
her, O
until O
he O
dated O
her O
again. O
Just O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
went O
out O
with O
her O
and O
that O
she's O
hanging O
around O
friends O
that O
I O
thought O
were O
my O
friends O
is O
bad O
enough, O
but O
in O
one O
specific O
video O
where O
they O
were O
singing O
at O
the O
concert O
they O
went O
to, O
their O
faces O
were O
*really* O
close. O
Almost O
like O
they O
were O
about O

were O

I O
am O
wildly O
hurt. O
I O
already O
feel O
like O
I'm O
being O
left O
out O
of O
a O
group O
that O
I O
hung O
out O
with O
for O
three O
years, O
but O
now O
that O
he's O
hanging O
out O
with O
her, O
I O
feel O
like O
I'm O
being O
replaced. O
Throughout O
our O
entire O
relationship O
he O
always O
told O
me O
that O
he'd O
never O
had O
a O
connection O
as O
strong O
with O
anyone O
as O
he O
had O
with O
me, O
and O
I O
thought O
he O
really O
loved O
me. O
He O
seemed O
genuine, O
and O
I O
believed O
him. O
I O
really O
loved O
him O
too. O
Now, O
it O
feels O
like O
he's O
just O
scrambling O
to O
replace O
me. O
I B-Mental_Health
had I-Mental_Health
a I-Mental_Health
panic I-Mental_Health
attack I-Mental_Health
when I-Mental_Health
I I-Mental_Health
saw I-Mental_Health
the I-Mental_Health
video, I-Mental_Health
and I-Mental_Health
now I-Mental_Health
I I-Mental_Health
just I-Mental_Health
have I-Mental_Health
intense I-Mental_Health
anxiety I-Mental_Health
that I-Mental_Health
won't I-Mental_Health
go I-Mental_Health
away. I-Mental_Health
He's O
having O
an O
NYE O
party O
tonight, O
one O
that O
I O
obviously O
wasn't O
invited O
to, O
but O
I'm O
heartbroken O
because O
I O
know O
that O
his O
ex O
will O
probably O
be O
there, O
and O
we O
used O
to O
throw O
an O
NYE O
party O
together O
every O
year O
when O
we O
lived O
together. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
should O
also O
be O
said O
that O
he O
never O
deleted O
pictures O
of O
him O
with O
his O
ex, O
but O
he O
deleted O
pictures O
of O
us O
from O
his O
Instagram. O
Even O
after O
we O
had O
an O
argument O
about O
the O
pictures O
still O
being O
up O
while O
we O
were O
dating, O
and O
he O
told O
me O
"She O
was O
a O
big O
part O
of O
my O
life O
for O
a O
while. O
I'm O
not O
just O
going O
to O
delete O
the O
pictures." O
But O
then O
he O
took O
pictures O
of O
us O
off O
of O
his O
Instagram. O
On O
his O
Facebook O
they're O
still O
up, O
just O

much O
to O
handle O
right O

I O

he's O
not O
doing O
anything O

it's O

I O
was O
planning O
my O
best O
chance O
of O
escape. O
I O
now O
qualify O
as O
“an O
official O
badass”. O
I O
don’t O
know O
about O
that. O
I O
might O
have O
done O
anything O
but O
think O
straight O
if O
I O
had O
realized O
at O
the O
time O
he O
pulled O
the O
trigger. O
A O
friend O
of O
mine O
watched O
the O
video O
and O
said O
Lane O
had O
to O
have O
been O
with O
me O
for O
that O
gun O
to O
misfire O
and O
then O
jam. O

After O
the O
movie O
maybe O
I’ll O
play O
our O
game O
a O
bit. O
Maybe O
use O
his O
account O
and O
characters. O
Even O
if O
things O
hadn’t O
happened O
like O
this, O
it’s O
probably O
what O
we’d O
have O
been O
doing O
anyway, O
[SEP]
Do O
whatever O
your O
mind/body O
allows O
you O
to. O
I O
felt O
such O
a O
great O
need O
at O
my O
first O
Xmas O
post O
brothers O
death O
to O
be O
ok O
and O
look O
happy O
and O
it O
drained O
me O
emotionally O
and O
physically. O
Take O
the O
time O
to O
be O
loved O
by O
those O
around O
you O
and O
do O
whatever O
you O
are O
able O
to. O
[SEP]
I’m O
pretending O
life’s O
okay O
with O
my O
husband O
even O
though O
it’s O
not. O
Wishing O
you O

tonight O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
we O

my I-Personal_Experiences
brother I-Personal_Experiences
to I-Personal_Experiences
suicide I-Personal_Experiences
in B-Time
July I-Time
of I-Time
this I-Time
year. I-Time
He O
was O
only O
30, O
and O
although O
taller O
than O
me, O
my O
little O
brother. O
My O
grief O
is O
overwhelming. O
I O
was O
only O
15 O
months O
older O
than O
him...we O
used O
to O
be O
so O
close O
then O
drifted O
apart. O
My O
heart O
is O
beyond O
broken. O
It O
has O
caused O
me O
to O
set O
relationships O
ablaze O
in O
my O
pursuit O
for O
happiness. O
Therapy O
is O
only O
a O
bit O
helpful. O
I O
understand O
what O
they O
are O
saying O
but O
my O
feelings, O
my O
grief, O
they O
just O
have O
me O
on O
autopilot. O
So, O
tonight O
I O
drink, O
and O
I'll O
likely O
text O
my O
brother O
another O
emotional O
and O
heavy O
hearted O
text...that O
will O
never O
be O
read...but O
Happy O
New O
Year O
everyone. O
May O
our O
loss O
just O
be O
a O
reminder O
of O
the O
love O
we O
had O

have. O

friend. O
So O
sorry O
for O
you O
loss. O
[SEP]
We O
rallied O
to O
celebrate O
Christmas O
and O
new O
year O
despite O
losing O
mom O
in O
May O
2022 O
and O
I’m O
glad O
we O
did O
❤️ O
It O
was O
so O
hard O
but O
I O
think O
making O
the O
effort O
bonded O
our O
family O
and O
honored O
the O
memory O
of O
our O
Mom O
who O
loved O
holidays. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Every O
family O
is O
different O
though. O
Do O
what O
you O
have O
to O
do O
to O
get O
through O
it O
and O
heal O
. O
[SEP]
I O
lost O
my O
dad O
on O
October O
30 O
so O
yesterday O
it O
was O
the O
two O
month O
anniversary O
and O
I O
don’t O
feel O
like O
celebrating O
at O
all. O
I O
usually O
insist O
my O
family O
to O
do O
something O
with O
me O
but O
this O
year O
I O
came O
to O
bed O
at O
10:15 O
pm O
and O
I O
don’t O
even O
wanna O
FaceTime O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
the O
typical O
new O
year’s O
call. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
a O
void O
of O
darkness… O
I O
can’t O
feel O
love O
for O
my O
boyfriend O
or O
basically O
anyone O
other O
than O
for O
my O
mom. O
[SEP]
Crying O
and O
working... O
getting O
double O
time O
and O
half O
and O
free O
pizza O
though O
[SEP]
Just O
finished O
watching O
the O
new O
Avatar O
movie O
and O
cried O
for O
most O
of O
it O
- O
out O
of O
beauty O
and O
joy O
waiting O
for O
this O
film O
but O
also O
for O
not O
being O
able O
to O
experience O
with O
my O
little O
brother O
even O
though O
he O
never O
liked O
the O
now O
series. O
My O
brother O
died O
unexpectedly O
Halloween O
this O
year O
and O
nye O
was O
one O
of O
his O
favorite O
holidays O
cause O
he O
would O
"stay O
up O
anyways". O
My O
door O
to O
my O
room O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
open O
as O
is O
his O
and O
we O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
playing O
games O
just O
talking O
across O
the O
way O
to O
each O
other O
like O
always... O
but O
its O
been O
closed O
sense O
that O
day. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
I'm O
just O
sitting O
here O
trying O
to O
get O
myself O
to O
play O
a O
game. O
Do O
anything... O
he'd O
be O
proud O
I'm O
still O
here O
and O
the O
help O
I O
got O
after O
everything O
but O
I'm O
scared O
to O
go O
into O
2023 O
without O
my O
best O
friend. O
[SEP]
I'm O
so O
glad O
you O
made O
this O
post. O
I O
lost O
my O
mom O
this O
year O
and O
I'm O
staying O
in. O
It's O
been O
really O
hard. O
I O
hope O
you O
hang O
in O
there O
and O
know O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
heal O
on O
any O
specific O
timeline. O
Sending O
love O
[SEP]
I’m O
staying O
home O
with O
my O
mom, O
dad O
passed O
this O
autumn. O
Watching O
stuff O
on O
tv O
with O
wine O
and O
a O
cheese O
board. O
It’s O
hard. O
I O
keep O
thinking O
as O
time O
passes O
I’ll O
get O
more O
used O
to O
it O
but O
it O
seems O
the O
more O
time O
that O
goes O
by, O
the O
harder O
it O
is O
reconciling O
with O
his O
death. O
Life O
is O
hard O
[SEP]
My O
mom O
passed O
away O
in O
September O
and O
even O
tho O
it’s O
hard O
I’m O
spending O
time O
with O
my O
friends O
tonight. O
For O
me O
it’s O
better O
than O
the O
alternative O
of O
being O
alone O
with O
my O
thoughts O
[SEP]
I O
lost O
my O
Dad O
in O
October O
2020 O
and O
my O
Mom O
June O
2022 O
My O
first O
holiday O
in O
62 O
years O
that O
i O
have O
had O
to O
spend O
the O
holidays O
alone. O
Let O
me O
just O
say; O
i O
can O
burst O
into O
tears O
without O
warning. O
I O
really O
really O
miss O
them. O
[SEP]
Lost O
my O
father O
and O
my O
mother O
May O
and O
June O
2022. O
Cried O
my O
heart O
out O
during O
Christmas O
and O
New O
Year. O
I O
lived O
with O
them O
all O
my O
life. O
I O
did O
my O
best O
at O
work O
so O
I O
can O
spoil O
them. O
My O
world O
revolved O
around O
them. O
May O
we O
have O
more O
better O
days O
to O
come. O
[SEP]
My O
sister O
f(34) O
passed O
6 O
weeks O
ago. O
She O
had O
cancer, O
but O
we O
didn't O
expect O
her O
to O
go O
so O
quickly. O
My O
partner O
and O
I O
just O
stayed O
in. O
We O
tried O
to O
keep O
ourselves O
busy O
by O
playing O
board O
games, O
as O
we O
couldn't O
sleep. O
We O
lit O
a O
candle O
for O
her. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
still O
can't O
believe O
she O
is O
gone. O

a O
few O
days O
and O
I O
cant O
be O
bothered O
to O
celebrate O
it. O
Dad O

I O
had O
plans O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bar, O
what O
drinks O
i O
would O
have, O
my O
mom O
would O
be O
the O
DD. O

[SEP]
My O

so O
I'm O
focused O
on O

job O
but O
bad O
days O
happen. O
[SEP]
My O
dad, O
October O
6th. O
The O
holidays O
have O
been O
unbearable. O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I’m O
looking O
at O
the O
world O
through O
dark, O
tinted O
glasses. O
Everything O
is O
darker, O
I O
don’t O
feel O
genuine O
joy O
at O
anything. O
[SEP]
Eating O
the O
last O
pint O
of O
ice O
cream. O
I O

the O
last. O
[SEP]
I O
lost O
my O
mom O
November O
of O
2021 O
and O
my O
dad O
a O
few O
months O
ago. O
Christmas O
didn’t O
feel O
like O
anything O
this O
year. O
It O
just… O
was. O
I O
just O
gave O
myself O
compassion O
and O
let O
what O
it O
was, O
be. O
I O
made O
it. O
[SEP]
It’s O
been O
6 O
years O
now O
without O
my O
mom, O
but O
New O
Years O
always O
hits O
hard O
because O
she O
was O
ADAMANT O
about O
going O
to O
Cracker O
Barrel O
and O
eating O
black O
eyed O
peas O
and O
collards O
and O
cornbread O
every O
year. O
Now O
I O
cook O
those O
things O
for O
myself O
on O
New O
Years O
Day O
and O
spend O
the O
day O
solo O
trying O
to O
prepare O
myself O
to O
make O
the O
best O
of O
the O
new O
year O
[SEP]
Also O
lost O
my O
dad O
8 O
months O
ago O
couple O
of O
days O
before O
my O
birthday, O
doing O
the O
same O
as O
you O
nothing O
much O
to O
celebrate..trying O
to O
move O
forward O
but O
every O
single O
holidays O
coming O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year O
being O
the O
first O
for O
everything O
really O
sucks O
[SEP]
My O
fiancé O
was O
February O
2021. O
Holidays O
are O
hard. O
Thanksgiving O
was O
a O
gut O
punch O
because O
his O
birthday O
sometimes O
falls O
on O
it. O
I O
spent O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
“holiday O
season” O
working. O
[SEP]
I O
lost O
my O
grandpa O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
ago O
due O
to O
covid. O
I O
thought O
we O
had O
more O
time O
and O
that O
he O
would O
make O
it O
into O
the O
new O
year. O
Ended O
up O
here O
because O
I’m O
feeling O
completely O
lost O
and O
dumb. O
I O
don’t O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
myself O
anymore O
[SEP]
I O
lost O
my O
husband O
on O
Father’s O
Day O
2022 O
and O
my O
best O
friend O
took O
her O
last O
breath O
@ O
6:13 O
PM O
December O
26,22 O
….. O
so O
yes O
I’m O
in O
the O
room O
holding O
on O
to O
my O
poor O
little O
doggie O
who’s O
scare O
of O
all O
of O
the O
fireworks O
noise O
right O
now O
( O
CA O
) O
I’m O
trying O
2 O
watch O
something O
on O
tv…. O
I’m O
so O
sad O
😭 O
[SEP]
Mum O
died O
in O
October. O
We O
went O
through O
Chanukah O
and O
Christmas O
and O
her O
birthday O
without O
her O
here O
and O
sometimes O
remembering O
that O
void O
rips O
a O
piece O
of O
my O
heart O
out. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
booked O
a O
local O
hotel O
with O
some O
friends O
to O
make O
sure O
I O
wasn't O
alone O
and O
that O
my O
husband O
and O
kiddo O
could O
have O
some O
fun O
in O
case O
I O
melted O
down. O
So O
far O
I'm O
sad O
but O
not O
a O
mess. O
Yet. O

all O
my O

My O
dad O
died O
of O
heart O
attack O
2 O
months O
ago. O
Despite O
feeling O
really O
gutted O
about O
holidays, O
my O
family O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
small O
dinner O
which O
my O
sister O
hosted. O
It O
was O
sad O
but O
we O
talk O
about O
random O
stuff O
and O
we O
sometimes O
reminisce O
things O
what O
would O
dad O
do O
or O
how O
he O
would've O
reacted O
on O
certain O
things O
that O
happened O
recently. O
It O
kinda O
alleviated O
the O
sadness. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
tried O
to O
keep O
busy O
and O
just O
enjoyed O
good O
food, O
company, O
and O
stories. O
We O
made O
it O
through O
holiday O
albeit O
trying O
way O
too O
hard O
to O
get O
through. O
I O
just O
hope O
the O
next O
holidays O
will O
be O
better. O
[SEP]
My O
mom O
died O
last O
May. O
Was O
expecting O
christmas O
to O
be O
hard, O
and O
it O
was. O
Spent O
last O
night O
with O
friends O
thinking O
it O
would O
be O
okay, O
but O
my O
boyfriend O
had O
to O
work O
so O
I O
was O
there O
by O
myself. O
And O
somewhere O
around O
12:15 O
while O
watching O
the O
fireworks O
it O
suddenly O
hit O
me O
that O
this O
would O
be O
a O
whole O
year O
of O
things O
she O
wouldn’t O
see O
and O
know O
and O
experience O
and O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
myself O
from O
physically O
running O
away. O
I O
was O
okay O
in O
the O
end O
but O
it O
caught O
me O
unawares. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
asking, O
kind O
stranger. O
I O
hope O
2023 O
goes O
easy O
on O
you O

My O
aunt O
passed O
suddenly O
right O
before O
Christmas. O
I O
suspended O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
expectations O
for O
Christmas O
+ O
tonight O
and O
just O
spent O
them O
as O
I O
would O
any O
other O
day. O
[SEP]
Being O
strong O
means O
surviving O
another O
day O
without O
them. O
The O
first O
year O
is O
always O
the O
hardest. O
I'm O
at O
my O
second O
year O
and O
I'm O
handling O
it O
much O
better. O
You O
will O
too, O
give O
it O
time. O
I O
keep O
reminding O
myself O
what O
my O
mom O
would O
want O
for O
me O
- O
to O
spend O
the O
day O
crying O
or O
to O
live O
a O
good O
life. O
So O
i O
do O
what O
I O
must O
to O
not O
worry O
her O
and O
to O
make O
her O
proud O
so O
that O
one O
day O
when O
I O
see O
her O
she O
can O
be O
happy O
and O
proud. O
That's O
what O
keeps O
me O
going. O

My O
dog O

My O
mom, O
who O
was O
also O
my O
best O
friend, O
died O
almost O
three O
months O
ago. O
I'm O
sitting O
at O
home O
with O
my O
husband. O
Overall O
I'm O
feeling O
shitty O
and O
worthless. O
My O
"friends" O
didn't O
call O
me O
or O
invite O
me O
anywhere O
since O
my O
mom O
died. O
They O
are O
also O
celebrating O
new O
years O
eve O
together O
and O
didn't O
invite O
me... O
thanks O
for O
the O
support O
guys. O
[SEP]
I O
lost O
him O
this O
year O
nov O
20th O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
holiday O
season. O
I O
am O
continuing O
the O
legacy O
that O
is O
them, O
as O
they O
live O
through O
me. O
Taking O
each O
step O
to O
assure O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
home O
we O
built O
together O
by O
caring O
for O
myself O
or O
the O
family. O
They O
were O
my O
fiance O
to O
be O
married O
next O
year. O
I O
sit O
I O
work O
and O
cry O
as O
I O
crawl O
towards O
our O
goals O
while O
I O
still O
have O
time. O
Nothing O
comes O
from O
nothing O
and O
nothing O
is O
easy. O
Today O
I O
rest O
so O
I O
can O
keep O
fighting. O
Good O
luck O
on O
your O
saga. O
[SEP]
My O
mom O
died O
27th O
of O
November. O
I O
wasn't O
close O
with O
her O
and O
I O
had O
troubled O
past O
with O
her. O
I O
had O
already O
cut O
ties O
with O
her O
and O
learnt O
to O
live O
without O
her. O
Despite O
that, O
I O
felt O
horrible O
for O
few O
weeks. O
Now O
I O
feel O
fine O
and O
I O
am O
living O
my O
normal O
life. O
I O
feel O
horrible O
for O
getting O
over O
it O
so O
soon. O
Sometimes O
a O
memory O
of O
her O
pops O
up O
and O
I O
feel O
wave O
of O
sadness O
and O
pain. O
I O
can O
say O
I O
miss O
her. O
However, O
I O
have O
accepted O
her O
passing O
and O
I O
am O
okay O
with O
it. O
[SEP]
My O
dad O
died O
in O
spring O
2021. O
I O
actually O
spent O
Christmas O
of O
that O
year O
alone O
because O
of O
Covid. O
It O
weirdly O
made O
it O
easier O
as O
I O
knew O
my O
mum O
didn’t O
want O
to O
do O
anything. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
the O
second O
year O
without O
him O
and O
we’ve O
done O
more O
this O
time O
around O
actually. O
I O
don’t O
know O
if O
that O
helps. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
it O
will O
always O
be O
a O
difficult O
time O
of O
year O
for O
loss. O
I O
think O
however O
you O
want O
to O
process O
it O
is O
up O
to O
you. O
Don’t O
feel O
any O
obligations. O
I’ve O
thought O
seriously O
about O
going O
away O
next O
Christmas O
to O
process O
the O
holiday O
season O
as O
I O
want O
to. O
Love O
to O
you. O
[SEP]
It O
will O
never O
be O
the O
same O
without O
my O
Mom. O
This O
is O
the O
3rd O
holiday O
season O
without O
my O
Mamma. O
I O
feel O
as O
each O
year O
goes O
by O
I’m O
leaving O
her O
further O
& O
further O
behind. O
Losing O
my O
Dad O
29 O
years O
ago O
was O
very O
hard… O
but O
loosing O
Mom, O
the O
pain O
is O
on O
a O
whole O
other O
level. O
💔 O
[SEP]
I O
lost O
my O
Mother O
on O
New O
Year's O
Day O
2022. O
This O
is O
the O
anniversary O
of O
her O
death. O
And O
the O
best O
way O
to O
deal O
with O
it, O
for O
me, O
is O
to O
not O
deal O
with O
it O
at O
all. O
I'll O
be O
doing O
absolutely O
nothing. O
TV, O
food, O
distractions, O
reading, O
maybe O
some O
writing, O
chilling. O
Probably O
go O
for O
a O
walk? O
Who O
knows. O

My O

Cancer. O

My O

I O
have O
dragged O
everybody O
to O
church. O
I’ve O
had O
more O
crying O
jags O
than O
I O
m O
willing O
to O
remember O
today, O
yesterday, O
this O
month. O
I O
can’t O
sit O
and O
just O
mourn- O
it’s O
not O
physically O
possible O
for O
me O
(something O
is O
wrong, O
I O
don’t O
sit O
still O
mentally O
or O
physically). O
I’m O
grieving O
with O
you- O
mine O
just O
looks O
different. O
I’m O
going O
to O
eat O
with O
my O
children, O
do O
laundry, O
breakdown, O

get O
up O
and O
try O

Everyone's O
grief O
is O
different. O
Grieve O
as O
you O
are O
grieving O
for O
as O
long O
as O
you O
want. O
Grief O
never O
goes O
away, O
nor O
would O
you O
want O
it O
to. O
It O
does O
usually O
change O
with O
time O
and O
becomes O
integrated O
into O
your O
life O
instead O
of O
being O
overwhelming. O
Take O
your O
time, O
but O
honor O
your O
dad O
with O
a O
fulfilling O
life O
of O
your O
own O
eventually. O

around O
1 O

and O
a O
half O

to O
Alzheimer's O
and O
(not O
a O
person) O
but O
a O
kitten O
as O
well O
to O
a O
car O
accident O
morning O
of O
XMAS O
eve. O
It O
broke O
me O
so O
I O
did O
nothing O
this O
NYE. O
Like O
some O
others O
have O
said, O
nothing O
to O
celebrate. O
I'm O
also O
pregnant O
so O
baby O
is O
the O
only O
thing O
I'm O
looking O
forward O
in O
2023. O
He's O
the O
light O
at O
the O
end O

we're O

Never O

depressed O
before O
[SEP]
I'm O
so, O
so O
sorry. O
Make O
sure O

yourself. O

Lost O
my O

in O
August, O
and O
didn’t O
do O
anything. O
Very O
happy O

sit O
at O

feel O
numb. O

I O
lost O
my O
dad O
in O
March O
of O
last O
year O
and O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
keep O
pausing O
and O
playing O
my O
grief, O
if O
that O
makes O
any O
sense. O
First O
time O
on O
this O
subreddit O
and O
I’ve O
finally O
pressed O
play O
again O
and O
I’m O
sobbing O
in O
bed O
not O
able O
to O
fall O
asleep. O

My O
mother O
passed O
from O
Alzheimer’s O
two O
months O
ago O
after O
suffering O
from O
it O
for O
over O
a O
decade O
- O
I O
am O
here O
with O
you. O
Alzheimers O
is O
the O
devil O
. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
sorry. O
I O
went O
through O
this O
with O
my O
husband O
in O
May. O
Truly O
the O
most O
awful O
disease. O
[SEP]
I’m O
so O
sorry O
for O
your O
loss O
❤️ O
[SEP]
I'm O
in O
the O
same O
boat...Feels O
like O
leaving O
someone O
behind O
regardless O
of O
how O
hard O
I've O
tried O
to O
remain O
still. O
Time O
continues O
to O
move O
forward. O
It O
will O
be O
a O
year O
in O
February O
since O
I O
lost O
my O
oldest O
child O
& O
son. O
Everyday O
since O
he O
transitioned O
has O
been O
of O
1sts, O
all O
over O
again, O
only O
now O
without O
him. O
I O
keep O
hoping O
to O
wake O
up O
every O
morning O
to O
life O
as O
it O
was O
before. O
I O
have O
to O
keep O
moving O
forward O
because O
he O
would O
want O
it O
that O
way. O
[SEP]
I O
used O
to O
love O
NYE O
now O
I O
don’t O
see O
how O
I’ll O
ever O
be O
excited O
about O
that O
day O
[SEP]
>I O
just O
want O
the O
whole O
world O
to O
stop. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
This O
is O
exactly O
how O
I O
feel. O
[SEP]
I O
just O
can O
feel O
I O
belong O
to O
this O
word O
through O
here. O
If O
I O
open O
any O
other O
social O
network O
I O
feel O
a O
huge O
disconnection O
of O
everything. O
I O
wonder O
If O
this O
feeling O
will O
disappear O
with O
the O
time O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
feel O
the O
same O
way. O
I O
just O
want O
the O
whole O
world O
and O
everything O
to O
stop O
and O
now O
I’m O
thinking O
that O
he O
never O
will O
lived O
in O
2023. O
[SEP]
That’s O
a O
very O
callous O
thing O
to O
say O
to O
someone O
grieving. O
I O
lost O
my O
mom O
in O
September O
and O
if O
my O
husband O
said O
that O
to O
me, O
we’d O
have O
a O
huge O
problem. O
If O
it’s O
so O
hard O
to O
see O
you O
sad, O
imagine O
how O
he’d O
feel O
BEING O
sad. O
[SEP]
!!! O
Oh O
my O
goodness O
this O
enraged O
me O
to O
see O
this! O
Im O
so O
so O
sorry O
dear. O
People O
who O
say O
things O
like O
this O
are O
not O
worth O
listening O
to, O
I'm O
so O
sorry O
your O
husband O
has O
not O
been O
supportive O
during O
such O
a O
difficult O
time. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
space O
at O
home O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
where O
you O
can O
grieve O
comfortably, O
please O
seek O
it O
out, O
and O
do O
whatever O
you O
need O
for O
your O
sanity O
and O
health. O

you O

I'll O
never O
fucking O
get O
over O
it. O
Never. O
I O
might O
get O
used O
to O
it... O
But O
there O
will O
never O
be O
as O
much O
light O
or O
color O
in O
my O
world O
as O
there O
was O
before O
my O
Dad O
died. O

I O
am O
genuinely O
so O
mad O
for O
you O
wtf O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O

That O
sucks, O
he’s O
being O
ridiculous O
and O
he’s O
incredibly O
lucky O
that O
it O
hasn’t O
happened O
to O
him O
yet. O
Hopefully O
he’ll O
come O
the O
realization O
and O
apologize, O
if O
not O
I’m O
truly O
sorry O
you O
are O
legally O

Truth O

I O

my O

you’re O

My O

have O
been O
my O
rock O
and O
I O
know O
I've O
disappointed O
them. O

The O

well O
she O
can O
go O

[SEP]
It O
might O
seem O
like O
you’ve O
disappointed O
them O
but O
really O
I O
don’t O
think O
you O
have. O
I O
mean O
I O
don’t O
know O
your O
family O
dynamic O
but O
it O
always O
seems O
worse O
than O
it O
is O
right O
now. O
[SEP]
They've O
had O
to O
endure O
10 O
years O
of O
my O
exes O
bullshit. O
My O
fiance O
was O
the O
one O
who O
'shielded' O
then O
from O
it O
- O
and O
that's O
why O
I O
am O
in O
so O
much O
pain. O
My O
best O
friend, O
lover O
and O
life O
partner O
is O
gone O
😞😭😭😭😭 O
[SEP]
I’m O
really O
sorry. O
Once O
again O
I O
don’t O
know O
enough O
about O
your O
family O
dynamic O
I O
just O
know O
the O
hurt O
of O
the O
loss. O
I O
can’t O
make O
it O
better O
but O
I O
hope O
you O
find O
some O
solace O
soon. O
Life O
is O
going O
to O
go O
on O
and O
they O
aren’t. O
It’s O
ripping O
my O
own O
heart O
out O
to O
say O
that… O
but O
it’s O
true. O
I O
can’t O
fix O
it… O
but O
you’re O
not O
alone. O
I’m O
a O
random O
dude O
you O
never O
met O
but O
I’m O
just O
going O
to O
sit O
here O
and O
grieve O
right O
beside O
you O
if O
that’s O
okay. O
[SEP]
And O
that's O
all O
I O
can O
ask O
anyone O
for. O
She O
was O
a-flipping-mazing!!! O
We O
were O
going O
to O
get O
married O
next O
year. O
And O
all O
she O
wanted O
was O
a O
beach O
wedding, O
so O
people O
didn't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
fancy O
clothes. O
[SEP]
What’s O
her O
name? O
[SEP]
Her O
name O
is O
Astrid. O
[SEP]
Well O
here’s O
to O
Astrid O
and O
Nicole. O
We O
miss O
them O
and O
we’re O
both O
thinking O
about O
them O
and O
even O
though O
I’m O
not O
religious O
I O
would O
like O
to O
think O
that O
their O
energy O
sees O
this O
somehow. O
Have O
a O
good O
night O
and O
hope O
you O
get O
your O
peace O
when O
and O
where O
you O
can. O
[SEP]
To O
Nicole O
and O
Astrid, O
Mey O
their O

never O
fade O
and O
their O
souls O
be O
at O
peace. O
[SEP]

I O

It's O
been O
a O
year O
[SEP]
A O
year O
ago, O
on O
the O
night O
of O
December O
31st, O
I O
sent O
this O
message O
to O
a O
friend: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
"Sorry O
to O
bother. O
I B-Gender
don't I-Gender
think I-Gender
I'm I-Gender
gonna I-Gender
be I-Gender
able I-Gender
to I-Gender
remain I-Gender
a I-Gender
man I-Gender
for I-Gender
my I-Gender
whole I-Gender
life. I-Gender
I O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
someone" O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
I O
did. O
I O
created O
this O
account O
(on O
January O
2nd, O
still O
needed O
a O
bit O
of O
courage). O
I O
talked O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
someones. O
I O
lost O
a O
very O
important O
someone. O
My O
parents O
call O
me O
by O
the O
wrong O
name. O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
my O
life O
is O
going O
to O
be. O
But O
I'm O
better. O
I O
don't O
wake O
up O
from O
dreams O
where O
my O
voice O
has O
been O
stolen O
from O
me O
anymore. O
I O
even O
sometimes O
dream O
about O
ordinary O
things. O
People O
call O
me O
"Ma'am" O
whenever, O
even O
with O
no O
makeup O
on. O
I'm B-Age
not I-Age
a I-Age
beautiful I-Age
woman, I-Age
but O
I O
don't O
care, O
that's O
not O
why O
I O
was O
there O
in O
the O
first O
place. O
And O
I O
feel O
more... O
solid. O
More O
grounded. O
I O
can O
notice O
things O
now. O
I O
even O
have O
complex O
emotional O
responses O
that O
aren't O
just O
anxiety O
and O
self-hatred. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
despite O
all O
odds, O
I O
lived. O
[SEP]

So O
here's O
to O

When O
I B-Location

I O

I O

a O

I O

perhaps O
related O

for O

I'd O
probably O
go O

just O
a O
bad O

What O
she O

to O

always O
worse O

what O
actually O
happened. O
This O
makes O
me O
want O

I O
find O
out O
that O
it O
wasn't O
as O
"bad" O
as O
she O
initially O
made O
it O
to O
be. O
I O
feel O
like O
she O
wanted O

be O
a O
victim O
so O
she O
can O
complain O
and O
someone O
feels O
bad O
for O
her. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
This O
gets O

I'm O

I O
know O
disrespexting O

I'll O
say O
things O

"you O

all O
over O
you. O
Then O
she O
gets O
mad O
at O
me O
because O
now O
I'm O
"lecturing" O
her. O
She O
further O
breaks O
down O
telling O
me O
how O
sh!ty O
she O
feels O
and O
I O
make O
it O
worse O
by O
telling O
her O
she O
"needs O

She O
needs O
therapy O
because O
this O
is O

normal O
behavior. O
She O

also O
need O
medication O

only O
a O
therapist O

how O

your O

constantly O
freak O
out O
all O

Children O
feel O

their O

behavior O

if O
they O
see O
her O
crying O

consoled, O
they O
will O
think O
they O
have O
done O
something O

Convince O
her O
to O
get O
help O

tell O
her O
how O
she O
is O
damaging O

Instead O

her, O
make O
sure O
your O

Your O

constantly O
dragging O

punishing O

We O

If O
once O

an O

Your O

needs O
a O
backbone. O
[SEP]
She O
sounds O
like O
a O
drama O
queen. O
She O
needs O
to O
grow O
up O
if O
things O
are O
constantly O
“happening O

her O
“. O
Personally O
I’d O
stop O
feeding O
it O
by O
giving O
energy O
and O
attention. O
[SEP]
Get O
her O
into O
therapy. O
[SEP]
She O
is O
astoundingly O
immature O
and O
the O
two O
of O
you O
seem O
stuck O
in O
a O
deeply O
codependent O
relationship. O
Insist O
that O
she O
gets O
into O
therapy O
so O
she O
can O
learn O
to O
stand O
on O
her O
own O
two O
feet. O
And O
get O
some O
yourself O
so O
you O
can O
learn O
to O
let O
her. O
She O
sounds O
exhausting, O
OP. O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
divorcebait O
[SEP]
This O
sounds O
like O
untreated O
severe O
anxiety. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
probably O
needed O
to O
be O
on O
meds O
a O
decade O
ago. O
Please O
make O
her O
go O
see O
a O
professional O
and O
be O
patient O
in O
helping O
her O
find O
an O
equilibrium. O
[SEP]
When O
I O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
is O
like O
that O
I O
let O
her O
vent O
with O
the O
phone O
on O
my O
table. O
I O
get O
on O
with O
what O
I’m O
doing O
and O
whenever O
I O
stop O
hearing O
her O
voice O
come O
through O
I O
murmur O
something. O
[SEP]
Because O
she O
wants O
to O
vent, O
she O
doesn’t O
want O
solutions O
or O
ideas. O
I O
don’t O
think O
she O
realizes O
I’m O
not O
listening O
to O
her O
and O
I O
can’t O
because O
I’m O
a O
pragmatist O
and O
it O
would O
drive O
me O
crazy. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
know O
if O
this O
is O
a O
solution O
for O
a O
spouse O

it O
works O
well O
for O

You O
are O
not O
supposed O
to O
be O
anyone's O
punching O
bag. O
Especially, O
and O
most O
importantly, O
your O
wife's O
punching O
bag. O
You O
need O
to O
look O
in O
the O
mirror O
and O
tell O
yourself O
the O
truth O
- O
she O
is O
abusing O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
you O
have O
been O
allowing O
her O
to O
treat O
you O
this O
way, O
without O
any O
consequences, O
so O
you O
have O
basically O
been O
enabling O
her O
terrible O
behavior. O
Turning O
that O
ship O
around O
is O
going O
to O
require O
some O
real O
personal O
strength O
on O
your O
part. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
advice O
is O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
quiet O
and O
calm O
time O
and O
then O
sit O
down O
with O
your O
wife O
and O
SERIOUSLY O
tell O
her O
that O
you O
aren't O
willing O
to O
be O
her O
punching O
bag O
anymore O
and O
that O
she O
needs O
to O
seek O
help O
by O
therapy. O
If O
she O
starts O
to O
lose O
it, O
repeat O
that O
you O
are O
no O
longer O
going O
to O
participate O
in O
her O
unreasonable O
and O
overboard O
responses O
and O
will O
wait O
until O
she O
get O
herself O
under O
control. O
Then O
get O
up O
and O
walk O
away. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Honestly, O
OP, O
this O
is O
not O
something O
you O
can O
fix. O
All O
you O
can O
do O
is O
to O
start O
protecting O
yourself O
from O
her O
behavior. O
She O
has O
to O
fix O
this. O
Or O
not. O
And O
then O
you O
will O
have O
to O
decide O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
your O
life. O
[SEP]
This O
post O
is O
long O

worth O
it. O
I O
used O
to O
be O

your O

The O
crying. O
The O
avoidance. O
The O
negativity. O
I O
lost O
lots O
of O

because O
I O
was O
a O
mess. O
Show O
this O

to O
her O
because O
I O
am O
writing O
it O
directly O
to O
her O

to O
you. O
It O

coming O

Clinical O
depression O
sufferers O
who O
never O
developed O
effective O
coping O
skills O
often O
exhibit O
behaviors O
like O
you O
wife's. O
She O
needs O
an O
evaluation O
by O
a O
GP O
then O
a O
Psychiatrist, O
possibly O
medication O
to O
get O
her O
up O
to O
a O
point O

she O
can O
learn O

and O
long O

behavioral O
counseling O
by O
a O
Psychologist O
or O
an O
experienced O
Licensed O
Clinical O
Social O
Worker O
to O
learn O
to O
recognize O
when O
she O
is O
going O
down O
the O
wrong O
path O
and O
apply O
effective O
coping O
skills. O
This O
stuff O
is O
a O

just O

how O
to O
repair O
a O

change O
a O

negotiate O
for O

It O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Her O
symptoms O
sound O
very O
much O
like O
mine O
when O
I O
was O
younger. O
Once O
I O
saw O
a O
doctor, O
I B-Health
started I-Health
antidepressants, I-Health
discovered B-Health
I I-Health
had I-Health
extremely I-Health
low I-Health
Vitamin I-Health
D I-Health
levels I-Health
in I-Health
my I-Health
blood, I-Health
got B-Health
a I-Health
referral I-Health
to I-Health
a I-Health
sleep I-Health
clinic I-Health
and O
was B-Health
diagnosed I-Health
with I-Health
sleep I-Health
apnea I-Health
from I-Health
being I-Health
overweight I-Health
from I-Health
eating I-Health
for I-Health
comfort I-Health
and O
figured O
out O
I B-Health
had I-Health
Seasonal I-Health
Affective I-Health
Disorder I-Health
(ironically I-Health
called I-Health
SAD) I-Health
by O
examining B-Mental_Health
my I-Mental_Health
patterns I-Mental_Health
of I-Mental_Health
depression I-Mental_Health
(I B-Mental_Health
always I-Mental_Health
got I-Mental_Health
REALLY I-Mental_Health
depressed I-Mental_Health
in I-Mental_Health
the I-Mental_Health
winter). I-Mental_Health
I O
learned O
how O
to O
recognize O
poor O
thought O
patterns O
and O
behaviors, O
how O
to O
change O
those O
behaviors O
and O
my O
life O
improved O
greatly O
over O
the O
next O
few O
years. O
Now O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
kill O
myself O
every O
day, O
I've O
learned O
when O
and O
how O
to O
assert O
myself, O
my O
career O
has O
taken O
off O
and O
I O
have O
developed O
good O
long O
term O
friendships O
and O
relationships. O
She O
needs O
help O
to O
get O
there O
and O
you O
need O
help O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
support O
her O
effectively. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Don't O
waste O
a O
day. O
Talk O
to O
her. O
Get O
her O
friends O
and O
family O
to O
encourage O
her O
to O
take O
action. O
It O
may O
be O
the O
hardest O
thing O
she O
ever O
does O
(it O
was O
for O
me) O
but O
its O
worth O
it O
in O
the O
end. O
If O
she O
doesn't O
understand O
or O
believe O
its O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do, O
have O
an O
intervention O
(learn O
how O
by O
googling O
"How O
to O
have O
an O
intervention") O
and O
talk O
to O
to O
her O
about O
your O
concerns. O
Tell O
her O
you O
are O
worried O
about O
her. O
Tell O
her O
the O
situation O
isn't O
sustainable O
and O
is O
deeply O
effecting O
your O
relationship. O
Listen O
to O
her O
then O
ask O
her O
to O
trust O
you O
and O
get O
help. O
Once O
she O
is O
comfortable O
enough O
with O
the O
idea O
(this O
may O
take O
time), O
then O
both O
of O
you O
talk O
to O
a O
General O
Practitioner O
to O
get O
a O
referral O
to O
a O
Psychiatrist O
and O
to O
evaluate O
her O
physical O
condition. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
There O
are O
all O
kinds O
of O
medical O
issues O
like O
thyroid, O
hormonal O
and O
adrenal O
problems, O
anemia, O
vitamin O
imbalances O
and O
other O
conditions O
that O
can O
be O
linked O
to O
depression O
but O
doctors O
have O
to O
run O
tests O
to O
identify O
or O
eliminate O
them. O
After O
those O
causes O
have O
been O
confirmed O
and O
treated O
or O
eliminated, O
the O
Psychiatrist O
can O
step O
in O
to O
help O
her O
with O
meds O
and O
find O
a O
qualified O
behavioral O
therapist O
but O
start O
the O
process O
right O
away. O
This O
is O
no O
different O
than O
if O
she O
felt O
a O
lump O
on O
her O
breast O
or O
had O
extreme O
knee O
pain O
that O
kept O
her O
from O
walking. O
Problems O
have O
solutions O
but O
only O
if O
you O
face O
them O
and O
seek O
help. O
Facing O
things O
may O
not O
be O
her O
strength O
right O
now O
but O
if O
she O
trusts O
you O
she O
can O
still O
get O
help. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Illnesses O
have O
to O
be O
treated O
to O
have O
improvement O
and O
there O
is O
no O
shame O
in O
treating O
any O
illness. O
My O
illnesses O
bundled O
together O
almost O
killed O
me O
but O
now O
I'm O
so O
glad O
I O
took O
action. O
I O
learned O
that O
some O
were O
genetic/medical O
(neurotransmitter O
regulation O
problems O
and O
vitamin O
deficiency), O
some O
were O
weight O
& O
sleep O
related O
and O
others O
required O
I O
just O
learn O
better O
ways O
of O
dealing O
with O
my O
problems. O
I O
DID! O
I O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
help O
along O
the O
way O
but O
I O
got O
better. O
She O
can O
too. O
Just O
help O
her O
take O
the O

step. O

We O
call O
her O

1/100 O

something O
crazy O
DID O
happen O
and O
she's O
absolutely O
not O
making O
it O
up, O

reality O
is...greatly O
exaggerated. O

Honestly O
I'm O
pretty O

it's O

that O
doesn't O
excuse O

Some O

don't O
want O

that's O

[SEP]
Try O
just O
listening. O
See O

that O
helps. O
[SEP]
She O
needs O
to O
get O
into O
some O
serious O
therapy O
and O
learn O
to O
take O
control O
of O
her O
life. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
need O
some O
help, O
too, O
but O
not O
nearly O
as O
much, O
so O
you O
can O
handle O
this O
properly. O
You O
need O
to O
draw O
a O
line--"You O
don't O
want O
me O
to O
help O
you, O
you O
keep O
getting O
into O
these O
situations, O
and O
I'm O
tired O
of O
all O
the O
drama." O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
if O
she O
won't O
get O
help, O
well, O
you O
know O
what O
you O
need O
to O
do, O
and O
it O
involves O
lawyers. O
For O
your O
own O
mental O
health, O
you O
can't O
allow O

just O
listen O

things O

Then O
she O
gets O
mad O
at O
me O

now O
I'm O
"lecturing" O
her. O
She O
further O
breaks O
down O
telling O
me O
how O

she O
feels O

I O
make O
it O
worse O
by O
telling O
her O
she O
"needs O

Saying O
"don't O
let O
people O
walk O
all O
over O
you" O
isn't O
consoling O
here. O
You O
are O
lecturing O
her O
at O
this O
point O
and O
it O
seems O
she O
wants O
comfort, O
not O
solutions O
here. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
would O
suggest O
that O
you O
have O
a O
clear O
conversation O
with O
her O
when O
she O
is O
calm O
and O
explain O
that O
you're O
not O
going O
to O
intervene O
with O
any O
situation O
unless O
she O
directly O
asks O
you O
to. O
[SEP]
She O
needs O
to O
fix O
her O
problems. O
Everytime O
she O
tells O
you O
about O
them O
to O
“vent,” O
she O
is O
dumping O
it O
on O
you O
and O
is O
being O
rewarded O
for O
not O
fixing O
it, O
unfortunately. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
a O
SO O
I O
would O
reasonable O
support, O
but O
cut O
her O
off O
once O
it’s O
too O
much O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Unfortunately, O
hate O
to O
say O
it, O
you O
would O
be O
enabling O
her O
further O
if O
you O
keep O
empathizing O
with O
her O
-> O
she O
never O
fixes O
her O
issues O
by O
herself. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
not O
sure O
how O
to O
fix O
this, O
I O
would O
probably O
listen O
to O
4-5 O
sentences, O
then O
change O
activity/subject. O
Gradually O
lessen O
how O
much O
you O
listen. O
Ask O
her O
questions O
and O
leave O
the O
answers O
hanging. O
Do O
not O
propose O
solutions O
and O
do O
not O
step O
in. O
It’s O
going O
to O
be O
a O
process, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
do O
this. O
[SEP]
My O
wife O
has O
a O
similar O
though O
not O
quite O
as O
bad O
behaviour. O
She O
interprets O
everything O
as O
a O
personal O
attack. O
She's O
been O
in O
a O
bunch O
of O
therapy O
and O
gotten O
prescribed O
medicines O
lots O
of O
times O
that O
she O
doesnt O
want O
to O
take. O
Thing O
continue O
to O
go O
poorly. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
This O
is O
not O
something O
that O
fixes O
itself. O
It's O
likely O
a O
medical O
or O
personality O
disorder O
that O
needs O
treatment. O
Please O
see O
if O
you O
can O
have O
her O
seek O
out O
therapy O
so O
she'll O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
feel O
better. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
that O
doesnt O
work O
give O
some O
thought O
to O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
want O
to O
live O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life. O
[SEP]
If O
she O
doesn't O
choose O
consciously O
to O
go O
to O
therapy O
and O
make O
the O
most O
out O
of O
it, O
you O
two O
are O
getting O
a O
divorce O
at O
some O
point. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
no O
clue O
how O
you O
can O
convince O
her, O
though O
maybe O
you O
should O
attend O
therapy O
yourself O
and O
recommend O
she O
joins O
you. O
But O
yeah, O
a O
person O
in O
poor O
mental O
health O
who O
refuses O
to O
deal O
with O
problems O
like O
an O
adult O
is O
not O
someone O
you'll O
be O
able O
to O
stay O
happy O
with. O
Don't O
let O
her O
run O
your O
life O
like O
you're O
caring O
for O
a O
toddler, O
she O
needs O
to O
commit O
to O
working O
on O
her O
problems O
healthily. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
a O
complex O
woman. O
So O
are O
her O
feelings, O
and O
she O
is O
immature O
and O
probably O
spoiled. O
Some O
of O
that O
is O
good, O
but O
her O
behavior O
is O
like O
living O
with O
a O

bomb.... O
[SEP]
Therapy, O
that's O
what O
it O
is O
for. O
[SEP]
Your O
wife O
is O
an O
emotional O
black O
hole. O
She O
needs O
therapy O
or O
something, O
I O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
for O
long. O
[SEP]
If O
she's O
such O
hard O
work O
I've O
got O
to O
wonder O
why O
you O
married O
her. O
[SEP]
Is O
your O
wife O
bipolar? O
Because O
I O
know O
someone O
like O
that O
who's O
bipolar O
when O
she O
doesn't O
take O
her O
meds. O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
your O
wife O
is O
pretty O
abusive O
[SEP]
This O
lady O
sounds O
like O
someone O
I O
used O
to O
work O
with. O
Played O
the O
victim O
always O
“cried” O
over O
everything. O
Yuck O
I O
hated O
her O
[SEP]
It O
sounds O
exhausting O
[SEP]
Ah O
Prince O
Harry. O
I O
feel O
your O
pain. O
[SEP]
She O
needs O
DBT O
therapy O
if O
she’s O
borderline. O
It O
can O
be O
incredibly O
effective O
[SEP]
This O
opens O
another O
can O
of O
worms O
😨 O
[SEP]
that O
would O
drive O
me O
crazy. O
I O
couldn't O
do O
it. O
I B-Interests
love I-Interests
politics, I-Interests
but O
when O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
starts O
in O
about O
some O
political O
thing O
that O
I O
have O
already O
heard, O
I O
want O
to O
shut O
it O
down. O
And O
politics O
are O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
subjects, O
but O
I O
need O
original O
thought. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Can O
I O
vent O
to O
you O
some O
more? O
[SEP]
This O
is O
the O
most O
direct O
and O
concise O
answer O
so O
far. O
[SEP]
There's O
asking O
someone O
to O
listen O
and O
there's O
asking O
someone O
to O
constantly O
take O
on O
their O
emotional O
baggage O
without O
remotely O
trying O
to O
be O
proactive O
about O
their O
own O
mental O
health. O
[SEP]
I've O
tried O
asking, O
she O
"doesn't O
know". O
She's O
not O
one O
to O
make O
decisions O
especially O
when O
in O
an O
altered O
state O
of O
mind O
[SEP]
I O
always O
want O
problem O
solving. O
But O
then O
again, O
I O
always O
want O
to O
problem O
solve O
as O
well. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
frankly O
all O
my O
female O
friends O
are O
the O
same. O
I O
guess O
we O
are O
anomalies. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
won't O
bring O
up O
a O
problem O
unless O
I O
want O
someone O
else's O
perspective. O
[SEP]
I O
literally O
just O
posted O
a O
similar O
comment O
😂 O
[SEP]
But O
how O
many O
hours O
a O
week O
does O
OP O
have O
to O
listen? O
For O
example O
is O
it O
okay O
for O
OP O
to O
say O
they O
will O
listen O
for O
say, O
one O
hour O
one O
time O
per O
week? O
[SEP]
She’s O
histrionic. O
What O
she O
wants O
is O
to O
be O
the O
victim, O
and O
having O
to O
take O
responsibility O
for O
her O
behavior O
interferes O
with O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
agree O
he O
shouldn’t O
say O
that, O
but O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
he O
is O
doing O
these O
third O
parties O
a O
disfavor O
since O
the O
circumstances O
are O
never O
as O
dire O
as O
she O
represents. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
absolutely O
needs O
counseling. O
This O
is O
not O
normal O
behavior O
and O
is O
harming O
her O
and O
her O
relationships. O
[SEP]
I O
second O
DBT. O
Maybe O
she O
would O
benefit O
from O
an O
intensive O
outpatient O
program, O
if O
you O
have O
one O
nearby. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
exactly O
it. O
She's O
a O
drama O
queen, O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
emotional O
vampire. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
when O
she O
starts O
talking O
about O
something O
bad O
happening O
to O
her, O
ask O
her O
if O
she O
wants O
anything O
from O
you. O
She O
will O
likely O
say O
no. O
Then O
take O
EVERYTHING O
she O
says O
about O
the O
situation O
and O
divide O
it O
by O
2? O
or O
3 O
or O
10? O
You O
know O
your O
wife, O
so O
you O
know O
the O
denominator. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
her O
drama O
is O
boring O
you, O
tell O
her O
that O
you O
are O
starting O
to O
be O
drained O
by O
all O
of O
this, O
so O
perhaps O
she O
can O
limit O
her O
outbursts/emotional O
dumping O
to O
once O
a O
week, O
and O
she O
can O
tell O
you O
all O
the O
times O
she's O
been O
a O
victim O
for O
that O
week. O
[SEP]
This... O
[SEP]
It's O
every O
other O
day O
it O
seems. O
It's O
almost O
predictable. O
[SEP]
She's O
high O
functioning O
and O
is O
a O
chiropractor. O
She O
doesn't O
own O
her O
own O
business, O
so O
she's O
a O
slave O
to O
her O
schedule. O
Outpatient O
services O
aren't O
conducive O
to O
her O
schedule O
and O
they O
are O
strict O
with O
attendance. O
[SEP]
My O
friend, O
I O
was O
married O
to O
one O
of O
these O
emotional O
vampires, O
it’s O
going O
to O
continue O
to O
get O
worse O
until O
she O
gets O
professional O
help. O
At O
some O
point O
YOU O
will O
become O
her O
target. O
You O
will O
say O
or O
do O
something O
“wrong” O
and O
she O
will O
turn O
on O
you, O
telling O
people O
you O
are O
a O
horrible O
husband. O
Abusive. O
Lazy. O
Unsupportive. O
A O
cheater. O
Whatever. O
Insist O
she O
get O
therapy O
ASAP O
before O
this O
happens. O
[SEP]
Honestly… O
let O
her O
call O
go O
to O
voicemail O
once O
in O
a O
while. O
She O
can O
tell O
you O
about O
it O
at O
dinner O
that O
night O
[SEP]
She O
needs O
to O
prioritize O
her O
mental O
health O
over O
her O
career O

how O

they O

They O

A O

Only O

can O
know O
for O
sure O
so O
have O
hope, O
but O
my O
doctors O
are O
optimistic O
and O
the O
treatment O
plan O
is O
in O
place O
just O
gotta O
take O
it O
one O
step O
at O
a O
time. O
There O
are O
good O
days O
and O
bad O
now O
that O
Ive O
processed O
what’s O
really O
going O
on O
but O
again O
like O
I O
said, O
the O
doctors O
seem O
optimistic, O
so O
I’m O
going O
to O
hold O
onto O
hope. O
surgery O
was O
rough O
for O
the O
first O
few O
days O
because O
of O
the O
swelling O
so O
I O
really O
couldn’t O
speak O
but O
after O
getting O
home O
it O
got O
a O
lot O
better O
and O
the O
pain O
went O
away O
to O
for O
the O
most O
part. O
Is O
your O
surgery O
scheduled O
yet? O
[SEP]
Are O
you O
in O
Philly? O
Go O
to O
UPenn O
- O
Dr O
o O
rourke. O
I O
did O
the O
“2nd O
opinion O
option” O
on O
their O
website O
and O
it O
took O
longer O
than O
expecting O
so O
call O
if O
you O
can. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
feel O
free O
to O
message O
me O
if O
you O
have O
any O
questions. O
I O
had O
my O
surgery O
9/1/22 O
[SEP]
If O
it’s O
any O
comfort O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
were O
waiting O
a O
month O
to O
get O
your O
next O
MRI O
it O
doesn’t O
seem O
urgent O
so O
that’s O
good. O
[SEP]
Wow O
how O
are O
you O
feeling! O
Crazy O
enough O
I O
tweeted O
at O
Dr O
Amankulor O
also O
from O
UPenn O
& O
he O
freaking O
personally O
called O
me O
tonight O
lol O
so O
I O
am O
hopefully O
going O
there O
tomorrow O

Mri O
shows O
low O

glioma O
without O

it O
lays O
at O
pineal O
region O

brain. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
yes, O
couple O
of O
doctors O
said O
I O
have O
to O
wait O
until O
next O
mri O
check O
just O
to O
get O
a O
sence O
of O
its O
dynamic. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I'm O
just O
afraid O
of O
losing O
that O
precious O
moment O
when O
everything O
might O
go O
bad. O
[SEP]
I O
feel O
95% O
back O
to O
normal O
4m O
later. O
I O
had O
an O
astrocytoma O
grade O
2, O
idh O
mutant O
that O
was O
totally O
removed O
and O
they O
decided O
I O
didn’t O
need O
radiation O
or O
chemo O
since O
it O
was O
removed O
and O
I’m O
close O
to O
40. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
it’s O
hard O
right O
now, O
but O
it O
helps O
to O
think O
“I’m O
not O
going O
to O
worry O
until O
there O
is O
something O
to O
worry O
about”. O
I O
switched O
to O
penn O
after O
I O
met O
the O
doctors O
on O
Tuesday, O
lucked O
into O
an O
open O
surgery O
spot O
and O
was O
home O
that O
Saturday. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
my O
tumor O
will O
grow O
back O
at O
some O
point, O
and O
I’ll O
deal O
with O
it O
again O
then. O
But O
for O
now, O
I’m O
trying O
not O
to O
think O
about O
if O
and O
when O
it O
does. O
I’m O
trying O
not O
to O
look O
at O
the O
future O
except O
to O
think O
why O
wait. O
It O
might O
come O
back O
when O
I’m O
50, O
or O
sooner, O
or O
later. O
Or O
I O
could O
be O
hit O
by O
a O
bus O
tomorrow. O
So O
if O
anything O
I’m O
using O
this O
as O
a O
reminder O
to O
seize O
the O
day O
when O
I O
can. O
[SEP]
How O
big O
is O
it, O
most O

slow O
growing O
[SEP]
Love O
that O
outlook. O
I O
have O
an O

with O
them O
a O

from O
today! O
Glad O
you O
got O
in O
and O
out O
so O
quickly. O
I’m O
a O
hypochondriac O
as O
it O
is O
so O
this O
has O
only O
exacerbated O
my O

haha O

Ah! O

they O

it O
out. O
[SEP]
At O
some O
point O
I O
understand O
it's O
relatively O
not O
so O
bad O
as O
it O
might O
be. O
But O
it's O
still O
a O
tumor O
that O
can O
grow O
at O
any O
time, O
at O
any O
circumstances O
and O
that's O
terrifying. O
I O
keep O
up O
seeing O
doctors O
but O
next O
month O
or O
two O
will O
be O
especially O
harsh O
for O
me. O
[SEP]
Understandable! O
Cope O
as O
best O
as O
you O
can, O
& O
take O
it O
one O
day O
at O
a O
time. O
Some O
days O
will O
be O
worse O
than O
others O
but O
you’ll O
still O
find O
reasons O
to O
smile O
too! O
The O
waiting O
and O
not O
knowing O
is O
the O
worst O

Siiighh. O
I O
hate O
that O
so O
much. O
I O
almost O
died O
when O
I O
was O
15 O

every O
doctor O
I O
saw O
thought O
I O
was O
either O
depressed, O
anxious, O
or O
had O
an O
eating O
disorder. O
It’s O
honestly O
so O
harmful O
when O
you O
really O
need O
answers. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
hope O
you O
get O
some O
actual O
answers O
soon! O
Also O
could O
you O
tell O

where O
you O
took O
that O

I O
want O

take O
it O
and O
see O
if O
it O

any O
of O

right O
lol O
[SEP]
That's O
why O
I O
always O
deny O
having O
depression O
or O
anxiety O
to O
doctors O
because O
that O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
they'll O
go O
to. O
Easiest O
diagnosis O
for O
them, O
which O
means O
they O
don't O
have O

it O
could O

I'm O
told O
it's O
anxiety O

depression O
at O
the O

so O
I O
figured O
what O
harm O
could O
an O
online O

be. O
I'm O
not O
going O
to O
take O
it O
seriously. O
I O
thought O
at O
least O
an O
online O
quiz O
won't O
call O
me O
depressed. O
It O
was O
a O
slap O
in O

I O
didn't O
see O
coming. O

I'm O

looked O

Anything O
that O

a O

If O
it O
has O

it O

Listening O

a O

I'm O

get O
out O

If O

trouble O
negotiating O
contracts? O
[SEP]
Hey O
all! O
I B-Other
have I-Other
been I-Other
traveling I-Other
for B-Time
about I-Time
1.5 I-Time
years I-Time
and O
have O
gotten O
relatively O
decent O
contracts O
but O
I O
have O
come O
to O
realize O
that O
my O
agency O
does O
not O
really O
let O
me O
negotiate O
much O
and O
usually O
tells O
me O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
manager O
after O
I O
sign. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
example, O
I O
am O
being O
offered O
a O
contract O
now O
with O
the O
pay O
range O
at O
the O
absolute O
lowest O
of O
the O
bracket O
given. O
I O
brought O
this O
up O
and O
was O
basically O
shot O
down O
immediately O
saying O
the O
contract O
listing O
stated O
the O
pay O
range O
before O
I O
said O
I O
was O
interested O
and O
that O
the O
quoted O
offer O
falls O
in O
this O
range O
(by O
$5). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
asked O
if O
I O
could O
have O
a O
clause O
that O
included O
block O
scheduling O
as O
my O
plan O
is O
to O
get O
a O
long O
term O
AirBnB O
with O
the O
option O
of O
being O
able O
to O
drive O
home O
some O
days O
that O
I O
am O
not O
working, O
having O
recently O
bought O
a O
house O
and O
having O
house O
projects O
to O
do O
(about O
7 O
hours O
one O
way). O
My O
agency O
basically O
said O
they O
cannot O
guarantee O
that O
and O
I O
would O
have O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
manager, O
but O
go O
ahead O
and O
sign O
because O
I O
only O
have O
24 O
hours. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
was O
then O
further O
told O
that O
I O
really O
should O
not O
be O
declining O
offers O
based O
on O
pay, O
location, O
or O
shift O
as O
all O
of O
that O
is O
laid O
out O
upfront. O
My O
issue O
being O
that O
the O
pay O
is O
a O
broad O
range O
and O
the O
shift O
just O
stating O
like O
3x12 O
but O
no O
guarantee O
if O
it O
is O
one O
off, O
one O
on O
or O
what. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
all O
that O
being O
said, O
does O
anyone O
have O
any O
experience O
with O
the O
same O
or O
tips O
regarding O
this? O
I O
actually O
do O
not O
mind O
the O
location O
of O
this O
contract O
offer, O
it O
is O
a O
smaller O
hospital O
so O
could O
be O
an O
interesting O
change O
from O
my O
normal. O
I O
am O
just O
more O
worried O
that O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
block-style O
schedule O
and O
my O
recruiter O
is O
basically O
saying O
sign O
now, O
ask O
later, O
and O
then O
what O
if O
“later” O
comes O
along O
and O
the O
manager O
says O
they O
cannot O
offer O
that. O
[SEP]
Give O
yourself O
an O
emergency O
fund O
so O
you O
can O
afford O
to O
be O
patient O
and O
picky. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Find O
another O
recruiter O
and O
leverage O
them O
against O
each O
other. O
Especially O
bigger O
agencies O
will O
try O
to O
lower O
your O
rates O
because O
they’re O
usually O
still O
higher O
than O
smaller O
agencies. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
go O
to O
the O
second O
recruiter O
anyway O
and O
be O
like O
if O
they O
can O
just O
match O
and O
give O
me O
xyz O
you’d O
be O
surprised O
what O
you O
can O
get O
out O
of O
it. O
[SEP]
I O
feel O
like O
its O
been O
a O
lot O
more O
difficult O
to O
get O
things O
added O
into O
contracts O
like O
block O
scheduling O
or O
patient O
limits O
when O
floated O
etc. O
They O
don't O
budge O
on O
their O
pay O
either. O
Things O
are O
changing O
I O
guess. O
[SEP]
So, O
the O
block O
scheduling O
thing, O
you O
should O
discuss O
that O
with O
the O
manager O
prior O
to O
an O
offer O
even O
being O
made O
(unless O
it's O
an O
auto O
offer). O
The O
manager O
should O
either O
agree O
or O
disagree. O
If O
they O
agree, O
then O
it O
should O
be O
written O
into O
the O
contract, O
as O
it's O
a O
pre-approved O
stipulation. O
[SEP]
The O
only O
way O
I've O
negotiated O
was O
by O
waking O
away O
from O
an O
offer O
for O
a O
better O
one. O
Tried O
asking O
nicely, O
tried O
showing O
what O
other O
travelers O
were O
making, O
tried O
to O
initiate O
a O
back O
and O
forth O
with O
recruiter/hospital O
but O
nope. O
[SEP]
The O
negotiation O
should O
happen O
before O
an O
offer O
letter O
is O
signed...even O
before O
you O
send O
them O
credentialing O
- O
that’s O
when O
you O
have O
the O
power. O
If O
your O
agency O
really O
seems O
averse O
to O
negotiation; O
I O
would O
reconsider O
if O
that’s O
the O
best O
relationship O
for O
you.. O
Many O
nurses O
have O
multiple O
agencies O
they’re O
in O
contact O
with; O
could O
be O
a O
great O
route O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
it O
has O
been O
harder...more O
of O
a O
'take O
it O
or O
leave O
it' O
attitude O
from O
the O
agencies O
it O
seems. O
Unfortunately, O
they O
want O
loyalty O
on O
the O
back-side O
but O
don't O
really O
seem O
to O
do O
anything O
to O
earn O
it. O
My O
recruiter O
from O
previous O
gig O
liked O
to O
say O
stuff O
like O
'I O
fight O
for O
you' O
and O
'always O
here O
for O
you' O
but O
was O
getting O
crap O
offers O
from O
dumpster O
fires. O
She's O
sorta O
given O
me O
the O
cold O
shoulder O
since O
I O
took O
a O
better O
offer O
from O
a O
different O
agency. O
However, O
current O
agency O
gives O
all O
the O
'corporate' O
responses O
when O
ever O
try O
to O
negotiate... O
even O
tho O
the O
hospital O
says O
their O
rates O
haven't O
changed. O
Extension O
has O
a O
slight O
bump O
in O
hourly O
but O
OT O
rate O
dropped O
a O
good O
bit. O
Next O
contract O
gonna O
be O
up O
for O
grabs! O
[SEP]
I O
did O
have O
a O
decent O
emergency O
fund O
built O
up O
but O
recently O
put O
a O
bit O
into O
buying O
a O
house O
so O
slowly O
building O
it O
back O
up. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
do O
think O
getting O
a O
second O
recruiter O
could O
be O
beneficial O
though! O
My B-Finance
last I-Finance
2 I-Finance
contracts I-Finance
have I-Finance
been I-Finance
in I-Finance
the I-Finance
lower I-Finance
half I-Finance
of I-Finance
the I-Finance
pay I-Finance
range, I-Finance
so O
having O
some O
leverage O
in O
regards O
to O
that O
and O
helping O
with O
scheduling O
could O
be O
beneficial! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
just O
having O
a O
harder O
time O
with O
this O
contract O
especially O
since O
the O
rate O
is O
actually O
lower O
than O
I O
was O
making O
as O
staff, O
without O
accounting O
for O
stipend O
of O
course. O
[SEP]
Yeah O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
lot O
is O
changing! O
I’ve O
normally O
been O
very O
open O
about O
my O
schedule, O
usually O
tell O
them O
I’ll O
do O
my O
best O
to O
work O
what O
they O
need. O
I O
just O
normally O
ask O
if O
they O
can O
to O
try O
to O
block O
them O
for O
me O
as O
it O
helps O
with O
arrangements O
with O
classes O
and O
stuff, O
but O
I O
am O
flexible O
in O
that O
I O
will O
work O
with O
them O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
specifically O
requested O
to O
add O
it O
into O
my O
contract. O
[SEP]
Good O
to O
know! O
So O
of O
the O
contracts O
I’ve O
done, O
I O
think O
I O
have O
spoken O
to O
a O
manager O
twice O
before O
the O
offer. O
Most O
of O
the O
time, O
I O
guess O
they O
are O
auto O
offers O
(at O
least O
in O
my O
case)? O
I O
definitely O
didn’t O
speak O
with O
anyone O
this O
go O
around. O
[SEP]
Don’t O
loot O
at O
the O
rate, O
look O
at O
the O
whole O
weekly O
pay. O
If O
that’s O
enough, O
take O
it. O
I O
always O
have O
an O
amount O
in O
mind O
that O
I O
won’t O
go O
under. O
[SEP]
There O
are O
not O
as O
many O
contracts O
out O
there O
now, O
which O
means O
you O
have O
less O
room O
to O
negotiate. O
[SEP]
Hourly O
rates O
being O
lower O
than O
staff O
rates O
are O
common. O
The O
stipend O
is O
where O
the O
real O
money O
is O
made O
[SEP]
You O
can O
still O
ask O
your O
agency O
for O
a O
contact O
number O
to O
discuss O
these O
things O
prior. O
Unless O
the O
listing O
specifies O
that O
it's O
an O
auto O
offer, O
you O
have O
no O
way O
of O
knowing O
if O
you'll O
talk O
to O
someone O
before O
signing. O
So O
if O
that's O
the O
case, O
then O
you're O
well O
within O
rights O
to O
turn O
things O
down. O
[SEP]
Thanks O
again! O
I O
may O
see O
if O
I O
can O
get O
a O
contact O
number! O
I O
would O
definitely O
love O
to O
speak O
with O
someone O
about O
their O
scheduling O
before O
signing. O

Hi O
y’all. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
little O
background: O
My O
first O
car O
broke O
down O
last O
year O
and O
it B-Finance
was I-Finance
just I-Finance
too I-Finance
expensive I-Finance
for I-Finance
my I-Finance
family I-Finance
to I-Finance
fix, I-Finance
it O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
lemon O
car O
and O
my B-Family
Dad I-Family
has I-Family
been I-Family
in I-Family
the I-Family
oil I-Family
and I-Family
gas I-Family
industry I-Family
for I-Family
years, I-Family
and O
ever O
since O
COVID, O
the O
industry O
hasn’t O
been O
doing O
too O
well O
and O
now O
he’s O
switched O
careers. O
Been O
a O
rough O
time O
for O
the O
family O
honestly O
but O
we’re O
on O
our O
feet. O
I O
grew O
up O
in O
a O
pretty O
good O
stable O
household, O
my O
dad O
pays O
for O
my B-Education
college I-Education
but O
I O
can O
tell O
it’s O
a O
struggle O
for O
him O
to O
do O
so, O
and O
I’m B-Age
21 I-Age
years I-Age
old I-Age
so O
I O
know O
it’s O
time O
for O
me O
to O
pull O
my O
own O
weight O
and O
purchase O
my O
own. O
It’s O
something O
I O
really O
want O
to O
do O
because O
I O
hate O
relying O
on O
others. O
My B-Family
siblings I-Family
also I-Family
are I-Family
going I-Family
to I-Family
need I-Family
my I-Family
parents’ I-Family
help I-Family
getting I-Family
a I-Family
car I-Family
so O
I O
need O
to O
buy O
my O
own O
regardless. O

the O

something O

[SEP]
Correct! O
All O
cars O
are O
equipped O
with O
a O
neutral O
safety O
switch O
and O
all O
modern O
manual O
vehicles O
have O
a O
safety O
feature O
which O
requires O
the O
clutch O
to O
be O
pressed O
in O
to O
be O
started. O
Also O
a O
good O
rule O
of O
thumb O
for O
manual O

is O
to O
put O
your O

to O

this O

on O

other O
than O
to O
check O
/ O
clean O
/ O
or O
replace O
the O
connections O
and O
get O
down O
to O
an O
auto O
parts O
store O
for O
some O
diagnostics O
of O
the O
battery O
and O
maybe O
some O
repair O
parts O
as O
others O
have O
mentioned. O
[SEP]
Check O
and O
clean O
the O
battery O
connections. O
If O
the O
car O
has O
been O
sitting O
and O
you O
can’t O
turn O
it O
over O
with O
a O
full O
battery O
or O
a O
jump O
start O
corrosion O
might O
be O
the O
issue. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
that O
doesn’t O
work, O
tap O
on O
the O
starter O
motor O
while O
cranking O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
wood O
or O
a O
rubber O
mallet. O
Sometimes O
they O
get O
stuck O
and O
just O
need O
a O
little O
jostle O
to O
turn O
over. O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
you O
have O
a O
dick/ O
Karen O
neighbors O
that O
is O
a O
cop O
caller. O
Yes O
you O
can O
push O
the O
car O
but O
you O
also O
need O
figure O
what O
neighbor O
is O
the O
spineless O
cop O
caller O
that O
is O
afraid O
to O
talk O
to O
their O
own O
neighbors, O
and O
would O
rather O
waste O
police O
resources O
on O
vehicles O
parked O
in O
front O
of O
your O
house. O
[SEP]
You'll O
want O
to O
look O
up O
the O
specific O
city O
parking O
code O
to O
determine O
how O
far O
it O
needs O
to O
go. O
I O
haven't O
looked O
at O
Bend's O
but O
most O
cities O
will O
say O
something O
like O
"cannot O
be O
parked O
on O
the O
same O
block". O
Non-operational O
vehicles O
usually O
have O
their O
own O
constraints. O
Instead O
of O
72 O
hours O
you O
may O
only O
be O
able O
to O
park O
it O
in O
one O
place O
for O
24. O

they O
somehow O
manage O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
always O
add O
a O
leftist O
slant O
to O
almost O
every O
topic. O
Things O
like O
discussing O
how O
much O
"more O

hunter-gathered O

were, O

the O

So, O
this O
guy O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
slight O
right O
bent, O
and O
his O
stuff O
is O
mostly O
alt-history, O
but O
in O
order O
to O
do O
that, O
he O
first O
explains O
"real" O
history. O
I've O
only O
watched O
a O
few, O
and O
would O
recommend O
them O
for O
anyone O
over O
about O

if O
only O
due O

But O
he O
has O

Looking O

I O
should O
have O
mentioned. O

does O
too. O

Your O

I B-Occupation
have I-Occupation
been I-Occupation
an I-Occupation
ESL I-Occupation
teacher I-Occupation
for B-Time
a I-Time
year I-Time
and O
really O
enjoyed O
teaching O
my O
students(kindergarten- O
elementary) O
I O
certainly O
think O
I O
lacked O
some O
professionalism, O
however O
I O
dont O
know O
if O
I O
went O
i O
was O
totally O
inappropriate O
by O
what O
I O
did. O
When O
I O
was O
being O
trained O
by O
the O
leaving O
teacher O
I O
noticed O
how O
all O
the O
kids O
seemed O
to O
know O
she O
was O
leaving O
and O
said O
goodbye O
to O
her O
on O
the O
last O
day. O
I O
just O
took O
mental O
stock O
of O
that O
and O
said O
in O
my O
head O
its O
normal O
for O
teachers O
to O
tell O
kids O
they're O
leaving O
before O
they O
go. O
So O
as O
my O
Contract O
comes O
to O
an O
end O
i O
tell O
my O
everyday O
kids O
im O
leaving. O
Some O
parents O
called O
in O
and O
asked O
about O
it O
so O
my O
boss O
got O
annoyed O
and O
told O
me O
to O
not O
say O
anything O
anymore O
and O
she O
would O
tell O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
kids O
when O
i O
was O
leaving. O
That O
never O
happened O
so O
the O
younger O
kids O
probably O
don't O
know O
what O
happened O
but O
it O
did O
eventually O
spread O
around O
so O
that O
most O
of O
the O
older O
kids O
new. O

Those O
older O
kids O
asker O
when O
I O
was O
going O
back O
to O
America O
and O
I O
was O
confused O
and O
just O
told O
them O
im O
not O
as O
i O
planned O
to O
be O
in O
this O
country O
for O
many O
years, O
maybe O
my O
whole O
life. O
After O
that O
they O
kept O
asking O
again O
and O
again O
for O
my O
number O
and O
I O
would O
brush O
it O
off. O
At O
that O
time O
i O
was O
brushing O
it O
off O
i O
also O
met O
with O
a O
friend O
native O
to O
that O
country O
and O
he O
mentioned O
how O
he O
was O
having O
lunch O
with O
his O
grade O
school O
teacher O
the O
next O
day. O
I O
was O
surprised O
and O
asked O
if O
it O
was O
common O
for O
people O
to O
do O
that O
here O
(since O
it's O
not O
really O
a O
thing O
in O
america) O
and O
he O
said O
it's O
not O
"common" O
but O
not O
"uncommon" O
either. O
After O
that O
I O
asked O
a O
teacher O
native O
to O
this O
country O
if O
it's O
not O
allowed O
to O
give O
out O
my O
number O
to O
students. O
She O
said O
it's O
uncommon O
but O
not O
"not O
allowed' O
so O
i O
just O
kind O
of O
sat O
on O
that O
for O
a O
while. O

So O
after O
my O

eventually O
I O
told O

we O
can O
make O
a O
deal. O
Ask O
your O
parents O
and O
If O
its O
OK O
then O
you O
can O
have O
my O
number. O
Some O
kids O
came O
back O
and O
said O
their O
parents O
said O
its O
OK O
with O
a O
note, O
some O
didnt O
and O
I O
didnt O
want O
to O
call O
them O
liars O
so O
I O
gave O
the O
ones O
with O
notes O
my O
number O
as O
I O
promised. O
Today O
(my O

asked O

I O

why. O
She O
told O

was O

I O
just O
kept O

why. O
She O
then O
told O
me O
not O
to O
pick O
up O
if O
any O
parents O
call O
and O
to O
never O
do O
that O
again O
as O
it O
causes O
stress O
for O
the O
teachers O
left O
behind. O
I O
really O
didn't O
imagine O
it O
was O
a O
big O
deal O
because O
of O
the O
responses O
I O
got O
from O
friend O
and O
coworker O
but O
now O
I O
wonder O
if O
I O
was O
wrong O
or O
if O
this O
comes O
off O
in O
a O
bad O
way. O
Maybe O
the O
kids O
did O
lie O
in O
the O
end O
to O
get O
my O
number O
so O
now O
I O
feel O
bad O
about O
what's O
happened. O
does O
anyone O
have O
any O
insight? O

So, O
I O
don't O
believe O
the O
intent O
was O
creepy. O
However, O
I O
don't O
think O
it's O
appropriate O
to O
give O
your O
phone O
number O
to O
children. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
understand O
that O
you O
grow O
a O
bond O
with O
some O
kids O
you O
teach O
but O
it's O
a O
job O
when O
all O
is O
said O
and O
done. O
We O
get O
jobs, O
we O
leave O
jobs. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
What O
happens O
if O
the O
kids O
contact O
you O
often O
and O
you O
can't O
reply O
- O
they O
get O
sad. O
They O
see O
you O
as O
an O
adult O
they O
can O
trust O
and O
rely O
on O
and O
that's O
just O
too O
much O
to O
expect O
from O
someone O
who O
was O
only O
there O
to O
work. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
change O
your O
number, O
do O
you O
let O
all O
the O
kids O
know? O
Or O
do O
you O
move O
on O
and O
let O
them O
feel O
confused O
as O
to O
why O
you O
stopped O
speaking O
to O
them. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
What O
happens O
at O
your O
next O
job? O
Then O
your O
next O
one? O
Are O
you O
going O
to O
give O
all O
these O
kids O
your O
phone O
number? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think, O
in O
future, O
you O
just O
say O
your O
goodbyes. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
think O
it O
was O
creepy, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
odd O
given O
that O
you O
teach O
elementary O
students. O
I’d O
just O
take O
this O
as O
a O
learning O
lesson. O
Next O
time, O
if O
your O
students O
want O
to O
keep O
in O
touch, O
give O
them O
your O
email O

[SEP]

Edit: O

[SEP]
What's O
done O
is O
done O
[SEP]
Perhaps O
just O
don't O
reply O
to O
anyone O
who O
happens O
to O
call. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Can't O
make O
people O
not O
grieve O
or O
miss O
you. O
It O
just O
means O
something O
good O
was O
happening O
for O
a O
while O
and O
you O
made O
a O
difference O
[SEP]
You O
are O
making O
your O
boss O
and O
colleagues O
uncomfortable O
which O
is O
probably O
reason O
enough O
to O
not O
follow O
through O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Otherwise O
do O
you O
want O
to O
be O
talking O
to O
kindergarten O
kids O
on O
the O
phone O
in O
a O
week O
or O
month O
or O
year? O
What O
were O
you O
hoping O
to O
get O
out O
of O
it O
[SEP]
It's O
possible... O
a O
stretch O
but O
possible. O
The O
kids O
are O
refusing O
to O
do O
things, O
saying O
that O
you O
didn't O
do O
it O
that O
way O
and O
then O
threatening O
to O
call O
you O
and O
prove O
it. O
[SEP]
It’s O
only O
creepy O
if O
you O
let O
it O
be O
creepy. O
Keep O
it O
professional O
and O
I O
wouldn’t O
worry. O
[SEP]
Wow O
I O
cant O
believe O
I O
never O
thought O
about O
that... O
thanks O
so O
much O
for O
your O
insight O
[SEP]
OK O
that O
is O
good O
advice. O
I'll O
try O
to O
avoid O
it O
in O
general O
but O
if O
it's O
difficult O
to O
deny O
them O
I O
will O
give O
my O
email O
address. O
Thanks O
so O
much O
for O
your O
response O
[SEP]
Thanks O
for O
saying O
it O
so O
kindly. O
Yes O
I'll O
just O
have O
to O
not O
reply O
to O
anyone O
if O
they O
call. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
I O
wanted O
my O
kids O
not O
to O
feel O
bad O
about O
me O
leaving. O
I O
see O
now O
it O
was O
very O
stupid O
of O
me O
[SEP]
Sorry O
I O
don't O
quite O
understand O
your O
meaning. O
Like O
a O
new O
teacher O
teaches O
a O
certain O
way O
and O
they O
call O
me O
to O
prove O
I O
didnt O
teach O
that O
way? O
[SEP]
Yes O
I O
only O
left O
my O
number O
if O
the O
parents O
needed O
a O
tutor O
they O
knew O
their O
kid O
could O
trust O
or O
something O
(and O
also O
because O
I O
felt O
bad O
that O
my O
kids O
looked O
so O
sad) O
I O
won't O
take O
anything O
in O
a O
personal O
direction O
for O
sure. O
Thanks O
for O
your O
reply O
[SEP]
Yeah- O
kids O
are O
annoying O
like O
that O
[SEP]
Oh... O
I O
feel O
so O
foolish. O
I O
had O
such O
a O
good O
experience O
with O
them O
I O
couldnt O
Imagine O
it O
would O
cause O
trouble O
for O
anyone. O
I O
really O
wasn't O
meant O
for O
teaching O
I O
think... O
[SEP]
Well O
if O
that's O
true O
then O
good O
for O
you O
for O
seeing O
that. O
But O
the O
trouble O
might O
just O
be O
that O
they O
liked O
you O
a O
lot. O
[SEP]
I O
guess O
I O
will O
come O
to O
know O
soon O
enough O
huh? O
If O
the O
parents O
ignore O
the O
number O
maybe O
its O
for O
the O
best. O
But O
if O
they O
don't O
I O
will O
make O
sure O
to O
explain O
to O
them O
I O
meant O
no O
harm O
and O
that O
the O
new O
teacher O
is O
very O
good O

so O
I'm O

what O
don't O
I O

What O
is O
most O

an O

Do O
I O
mention O
that O
my B-Sexual_Orientation

is I-Sexual_Orientation
distracting I-Sexual_Orientation
me I-Sexual_Orientation
from I-Sexual_Orientation
things I-Sexual_Orientation
I I-Sexual_Orientation
enjoy I-Sexual_Orientation
and I-Sexual_Orientation
need I-Sexual_Orientation
to I-Sexual_Orientation
do, I-Sexual_Orientation
because O
that's O
the O
truth. O
I'm O
sure O
this O
is O
me O
just O
over O
thinking O
(as O
I O
normally O
do) O
I O
just O
fear O
rejection O
and O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
I O
don't O
make O
any O
mistakes O
before O
I O
submit O
the O
form. O
Anything O
specific O
about O
Gender O
Doctors/ O
Dr O
Kirpal O
Sahota O
would O
be O
helpful O
too. O
[SEP]
Be O
honest, O
but O
don't O
stress O
too O
much, O
one O
of O
the O
upsides O
of O
private O
care O
is O
they O
are O
a O
business O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
so O
they O
will O
look O
for O
reasons O
to O
accept O
you O
as O
a O
patient O
rather O
than O
reasons O
to O
turn O
you O
away. O
[SEP]
Just O
tell O
the O
truth. O
If O
the O
clinic O
is O
competent, O
they O
will O
understand O
and O
know O
you’re O
trans O

on O
your O
honest O

There’s O
not O
really O
a O
way O
to O
make O
a O

it O

long O

you’re O

truthful O
that’s O
all O
they O
want O
to O
see O
[SEP]
I O
was O
worried O
before O
my O
private O
appointment O
after O
hearing O
all O
the O
horror O
stories O
from O
people O
who O
went O
the O
NHS O
route, O
but O
the O
doctor O
I O
saw O
at O
Gender O
Care O
was O
really O
nice. O
There O
are O
questions O
they O
have O
to O
ask O
to O
tick O
boxes O
but O
they're O
not O
trying O
to O
catch O
you O
out. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
When O
you're O
paying O
hundreds O
of O
pounds O
for O
an O
hour O
long O
consultation O
there's O
a O
lot O
more O
incentive O
for O
the O
doctor O
to O
actually O
help O
you O
so O
you're O
more O
likely O
to O
recommend O
them O
to O
other O
people. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
hope O
this O
helps O
and O
wish O
you O
the O
best! O
[SEP]
don't O
look O
suicidal... O
[SEP]
[SEP]
are O
you O
going O
to O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
via O
this? O
I O
am O
with O
LTC O
so O
got O
my O
diagnosis O
seperately: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
looked O
at O
a O
combination O
of O
the O
diagnosis O
i O
was O
going O
for, O
and O
the O
WPATH O
SOC O
so O
i O
could O
play O
up O
the O
parts O
of O
my O
life O
that O
fitted O
the O
diagnosis O
and O
things O
that O
could O
be O
seen O
as O
*signs* O
from O
earlier O
on. O
could O
be O
useful O
for O
people O
who O
didn't O
necesserilly O
'*know*' O
as O
kids O
or O
whatever O
to O
find O
something O
to O
talk O
about O
[SEP]
[SEP]
i O
also O
made O
sure O
to O
avoid O
any O
of O
the O
things O
that O
the O
WPATH O
SOC O
suggested O
could O
prevent O
transition O
- O
principly O
make O
sure O
that O
my O
mental O
health O
issues O
looked O
well O
managed, O
or O
however O
they O
put O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
the O
rest O
was O
a O
couple O
of O
general O
mental O
health O
multi-part O
quizes O
I O
think. O
they O
are O
generic, O
so O
could O
be O
researched O
and O
again, O
just O
look O
stable. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
LTC O
forms O
were O
mostly O
factual O
so O
that O
was O
just O
entered O
as O
is. O
including O
them O
having O
a O
copy O
of O
my O

sent O
from O
the O
GP O
i O
think... O
[SEP]
Yeah O
Gender O
Care O
is O
my O
back O
up, O
just O
in O
case O
I O
don't O
get O
an O
appointment O
with O
Gender O
Doctors O
but O
I've O
had O
a O
search O
around O
reddit O
and O
it O
seems O
that O
I O
will O
likely O
get O
an O
appointment O
with O
them O
since O
I've O
not O
seen O
a O
single O
post O
from O
someone O
who O
hasn't O
(it O
may O
take O
a O
few O
tries O
though). O
That O
put O
me O
at O
ease O
but O
still O
very O
nervous O
and O
the O
wait O
times O
for O
endocrinologist O
are O
going O
to O
be O
painful O
(though O
less O
so O
than O
waiting O
for O
NHS) O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
lucky O
for O
me O
most O
my O
mental O
health O
has O
gotten O
better. O
Less O
anxious, O
less O
depressed. O
Nothing O
really O
that O
couldn't O
be O
linked O
to O
gender O
dysphoria. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Gender O
Doctors O
seems O
a O
lot O
more O
simpler O
than O
LTC O
I O
feel. O
I O
have O
seen O
done O
more O
research O
and O
think O
I'll O
be O
fine, O
just O
over O
thinking O
again O
as O
I O
do. O
[SEP]
My O
wiat O
for O
the O
1st O
appointment O
was O
about O
a O
month, O
but O
about O
10 O
weeks O
for O
the O
endo. O
That O
was O
after O
I O
approached O
another O
endo O
who O
said O
they O
could O
fit O
me O
in O
around O
March O
2023 O

the O

If O
you're O

I O
do O

it O

that O
you O

therapy O
prior O

for O
a O
consultation O
and O
they'll O
go O
over O
the O
basics. O
I O
do O
recommend O
doing O
research O
into O
HRT O
first, O
just O
so O
you O
can O
go O
in O
somewhat O
prepared O
with O
any O
questions/concerns. O
(Note O
that, O
unlike O
HRT, O
surgeries, O
you O
will O
typically O
require O
letters O
from O
therapists.) O

I O
initially O
started O
at O
Clinique O
l'Actuel, O
which O
is O
public, O
but O
unfortunately, O
my O
doctor O
migrated O
to O
a O
private O
clinic O
(Clinique O
A/Centre O
DGL O
Hormonotherapie). O
You O
may O
have O
to O
face O
some O
wait O
times, O
so O
it's O
worth O
reaching O
out O
to O
a O
few O
places. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
These O
are O
the O
clinics O
that O
were O
recommended O
to O
me O
when O

(I O

they're O
all O

Oh, O
I O
should O
also O
note O
that O
I've B-Sexual_Orientation
been I-Sexual_Orientation
socially I-Sexual_Orientation
transitioning I-Sexual_Orientation
for B-Time
just I-Time
about I-Time
a I-Time
year, I-Time
and O
I've O
never O
had O
any O
issues O
here O
(though O
it O
helps O
that O
I'm O
mainly O
downtown, O
and O
I O
still O
mask O
a O
lot O
in O
public O
due O
to O
Covid O
concerns). O
I've O
never O
had O
any O
trouble O
at O
any O
CLSC, O
hospital, O
SAAQ O
outlet, O
store O
or O
anything. O
I've O
even O
taught O
classes, O
and O
nobody O
raises O
an O
eyebrow. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
resources O
available O
in O
this O
city O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
have O
such O
a O
large O
and O
vibrant O
queer O
community. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
can't O
promise O
all O
of O
your O
experiences O
will O
be O
positive, O
especially O
if O
you're O
outside O
of O
the O
downtown O
core, O
but O
it's O
certainly O
a O
good O
place O
to O
live O
as O
a O
trans O
person. O
[SEP]
[deleted] O
[SEP]
So O
they O
aren't O
going O
to O
pry O
into O
your O
financial O
situation. O
You'll O
just O
meet O
up O
with O
a O
doctor O
and O
go O
over O
the O
process. O
Explain O
to O
them O
that O
you're O
trans O
and O
that O
you O
want O
to O
start O
HRT. O
They'll O
go O
over O
the O
details, O
and O
you O
can O
ask O
any O
questions O
you O
have. O
You O
might O
want O
to O
look O
into O
benefits, O
risks, O
timelines, O
and O
administration O
methods O
beforehand. O
They'll O
send O
you O
off O
for O
some O
initial O
blood O
work, O
which O
you O
can O
get O
done O
at O
a O
CLSC O
(it O
won't O
cost O
you O
anything). O
The O
appointment O
at O
the O
clinic O
shouldn't' O
cost O
anything, O
or O
if O
it O
does, O
it'll O
be O
a O
small O
administrative O
fee O
(I O
think O
I O
had O
to O
pay O
$10). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
do O
end O
up O
opting O
for O
HRT O
and O
get O
a O
prescription, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
hormones, O
though O
fortunately, O
a O
chunk O
of O
the O
cost O
is O
covered O
by O
RAMQ. O
In O
my O
case, O
I B-Health
started I-Health
off I-Health
with I-Health
estradiol I-Health
(estrogen) I-Health
and I-Health
spironolactone I-Health
(anti-androgen). I-Health
I've O
since O
added O
progesterone, O
and O
my O
pharmacy O
bill O
is O
between O
$35 O
and O
$38 O
per O
month O
for O
the O
three O
drugs. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don't O
know O
how O
long O
the O
waiting O
list O
is O
for O
either O
clinic, O
so O
I O
would O
advise O
reaching O
out O
to O
both O
of O
them. O
If O
you O
do O
get O
an O
appointment O
with O
one O
of O
them, O
you O
can O
always O
let O
the O
other O
clinic O
know O
that O
you O
no O
longer O
need O
their O
services, O
but O
at O
least O
this O
way O
you'll O
be O
seen O
the O
soonest O
possible. O

I O

a O

about O

Whatever O
you O

NAD O
but O
I’m O
so O
sorry O
you’re O
dealing O
with O
that. O
As O
far O
as O
I O
know, O
the O
treatments O
for O
migraine O
(which O
sounds O
like O
what O
you’re O
describing) O
during O
pregnancy O
are O
pretty O
sparse O
and O
sound O
like O
what O
you’re O
doing. O
Some O
docs O
recommend O
tracking O
foods O
that O
might O
cause O
flare-ups. O
Also, O
I O
assume O
your O
blood O
pressure O
has O
been O
tested O
and O
monitored? O

My O
sister's O
boyfriend O
threw O
a O
plate O
at O
me O
because O
I O
don't O
have O
a O
coffeemaker O
[SEP]
She O
knows O
my O
main O
account O
so O
this O
is O
a O
throwaway O
account. O
She O
asked O
me O
if O
they O
could O
stay O
at O
my O
house O
last O
night O
because O
I O
live O
20 O
minutes O
away O
from O
the O
airport O
versus O
their O
apartment O
being O
an O
hour O
away O
from O
it O
(or O
more O
depending O
on O
traffic). O
I O
don't O
drink O
caffeine O
so O
I O
don't O
have O
a O
coffeemaker. O
This O
morning O
her O
boyfriend O
was O
so O
angry O
about O
there O
not O
being O
coffee O
that O
he O
threw O
a O
plate O
at O
my O
head. O
My O
sister O
excused O
him O
by O
saying O
that O
he's O
a O
"caffeine O
addict" O
and O
that O
he O
gets O
"cranky" O
without O
his O
coffee O
like O
that O
makes O
it O
all O
right. O
And O
she's O
angry O
at O
me O
for O
saying O
he's O
not O
welcome O
at O
my O
house O
now. O
I O
can't O
believe O
he O
thinks O
it O
is O
acceptable O
to O
do O
that. O
I O
asked O
my O
sister O
if O
he's O
ever O
done O
anything O
like O
that O
to O
her O
and O
she O
asked O
if O
I O
was O
calling O
him O
an O
abuser O
and O
got O
angry O
at O
me. O
[SEP]
Uhhh, O
you O
were O
nice O
enough O
to O
let O
them O
stay O
there O
and O
he O
cant O
slum O
it O
and O
go O
to O
Starbucks O
for O
a O
day? O
What O
the O
fuck, O
there’s O
no O
excuse O
for O
his O
behavior O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
kicked O
him O
out. O

Your O
sister O
spelled O
abusive O
asshole, O
wrong. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also, O
she's O
being O
abused. O
It's O
clearly O
been O
normalized O
in O
their O
relationship. O
And O
it O
will O
only O
get O
worse. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Have O
an O
intervention O
for O
her. O
[SEP]
The O
fact O
that O
she O
defended O
him O
is O
possibly O
a O
bigger O
flag O
than O
his O
behaviour. O
It O
would O
appear O
very O
likely O
that O
this O
is O
normal O
behaviour O
for O
him. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Are O
there O
any O
of O
her O
friends/other O
relatives O
you O
trust O
you O
could O
speak O
to O
privately? O
His O
behaviour O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
a O
one O
off, O
and O
your O
sister O
could O
be O
in O
danger. O
[SEP]
Wtf, O
yeah, O
being O
an O
addict O
doesn’t O
excuse O
assault! O
[SEP]
Should O
have O
posted O
this O
on O
your O
regular O
account O
so O
your O
sister O
can O
see O
all O
the O
people O
who O
think O
she O
and O
her O
boyfriend O
are O
shit O
heads. O
[SEP]
Did O
you O
immediately O
throw O
his O
ass O
out O
on O
the O
curb? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
yes O
sis, O
he O
is O
an O
abuser O
when O
he O
acts O
abusive! O
[SEP]
I O
bet O
he’s O
done O
much O
worse O
to O
your O
sister O
. O
Big O
red O
flag O
!!!! O
[SEP]
I’ve O
met O
raging O
drug O
addicts O
with O
more O
compassion O
and O
patience. O
Sheesh. O
Like O
that’s O
an O
excuse?! O
No O
one O
ever O
died O
from O
a O
caffeine O
withdrawal. O
Nor O
have O
they O
needed O
to O
have O
medical O
detoxes O
for O
safety O
precautions, O
from O
fckin O
coffee! O
What O
a O
douche. O

Sister: O
Are O
you O
calling O
my O
boyfriend O
an O
abuser? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Narrator: O
Her O
boyfriend O
was O
an O
abuser O
[SEP]
He O
is O
beating O
her O
ass O
too!!! O
You O
better O
believe O
it.. O
that’s O
why O
she O
ran O
to O
his O
defense… O
[SEP]
I'd O
have O
thrown O
him O
out O
on O
his O
face O
so O
quick O
your O
sister's O
head O
would O
spin. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
are O
justified O
in O
never O
having O
that O
donut O
cross O
your O
threshold O
ever O
again. O
[SEP]
I'm O
a O
caffeine O
addict O
I O
do O
get O
cranky O
in O
the O
morning.. O
I O
do O
not O
get O
to O
be O
cranky O
towards O
other O
people O
because O
of O
MY O
addition. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You're O
sister O
is O
lucky O
you O
didn't O
press O
charges. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
his O
violent O
outrage O
towards O
YOU.. O
would O
make O
me O
very O
concerned O
about O
what O
he O
may O
be O
doing O
to O
HER O
in O
private. O
[SEP]
Thats O
assault. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Use O
the O
correct O
words. O
Its O
not O
clear O
whether O
it O
hit O
or O
not, O
so O
he O
either O
assaulted O
you, O
or O
attempted O
to O
assault O
you. O
Ask O
your O
sister O
why O
you'd O
ever O
welcome O
back O
into O
your O
home O
someone O
who O
thinks O
its O
acceptable O
to O
assault O
you O
because O
they're O
cranky. O
[SEP]
Wait O
wait O
wait… O
he O
threw O
a O
plate O
at O
your O
head?! O
I’m O
sorry, O
but O
this O
**sounds** O
really O
funny, O
but O
are O
you O
ok?! O
A O
plate O
can O
really O
freakin O
hurt, O
can O
cut O
you, O
etc. O
[SEP]
You O
know, O
things O
I O
read O
on O
the O
internet O
everyday O
gets O
me O
to O
a O
point O
when O
nothing O
really O
should O
surprise O
me, O
but O
this… O
this O
is O
like O
wtf?!! O
He O
throw O
a O
plate O
at O
your O
head O
for O
not O
having O
Coffee. O
COFFEE!! O
This O
is O
not O
heroine O
or O
crystal O
meth. O
It’s O
f$&kin O
coffee. O
[SEP]
You O
should O
tell O
your O
sister O
that O
he O
assaulted O
you O
and O
is O
not O
welcome O
to O
be O
around O
you O
ever O
again. O
[SEP]
I O
mean O
who O
the O
hell O
throws O
a O
plate??? O
And O
over O
coffee??? O
A O
douche O
bag O
of O
a O
human. O
I O
hope O
your O
head O
is O
ok O
and O
the O
plate O
did O
not O
break. O
[SEP]
He O
is O
an O
abuser!! O
FFS, O
they O
sell O
coffee O
at O
many O
places, O
his O
lazy O
ass O
could O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
one, O
not O
throw O
a O
plate!! O
[SEP]
OP O
tell O
me O
you O
threw O
him O
out O
immediately. O
This O
is O
assault. O
[SEP]
Who O
the O
hell O
throws O
a O
plate O
to O
the O
person O
who O
hosted O
him O
for O
the O
night O
over O
something O
said O
host O
has O
no O
control O
over. O
God O
some O
peeps O
would O
need O
a O
good O
beating. O
Thats O
a O
piece O
of O
trash. O
[SEP]
Emergency O
instant O
coffee O
(Starbucks O
Via) O
is O
a O
permanent O
fixture O
in O
my O
travel O
bag. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Shame O
on O
him O
(and O
her) O
for O
not O
sorting O
it O
out O
the O
night O
before. O
Or O
ordering O
something. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
I O
wake O
up O
without O
access O
to O
coffee, O
that O
just O
gets O
me O
up O
earlier O
because O
I O
know O
I O
need O
to O
leave O
the O
house O
or O
hotel O
to O
find O
it O
elsewhere. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Maintain O
your O
boundaries. O
"Addiction" O
is O
no O
excuse. O
[SEP]
I O
would O
have O
told O
him O
he O
has O
5 O
min O
to O
get O
his O
shit O
and O
leave O
or O
i O
call O
the O
cops. O
Also O
there O
is O
no O
way O
he O
isn't O
abusing O
your O
sister, O
i'm O
so O
sorry O
OP. O
[SEP]
You O
should O
report O
the O
matter O
to O
the O
police O
and O
get O
a O
restraining O
order. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
thrilled O
you’re O
not O
injured O
OP! O
And O
very O
proud O
of O
you O
for O
banning O
him O
from O
your O
home!! O
[SEP]
Have O
you O
reported O
him? O
[SEP]
Hmmm, O
he O
strikes O
me O
as O
the O
type O
that O
wouldn't O
behave O
this O
way O
with O
another O
man O
around. O
Not O
a O
good O
look. O
[SEP]
Time O
to O
go O
no O
contact O
for O
both O
of O
them. O
Sorry O
this O
happened. O
[SEP]
So O
he O
threw O
a O
plate O
at O
your O
head O
for O
not O
having O
a O
coffee O
maker. O
I’d O
be O
even O
more O
on O
earned O
at O
what O
he’s O
doing O
to O
her O
behind O
closed O
doors O
when O
he O
doesn’t O
get O
his O
way. O
[SEP]
The O
dude O
sounds O
like O
a O
piece O
of O
shit O
and O
your O
sister O
sounds O
like O
an O
enabler. O
I'm O
glad O
it O
was O
just O
one O
night. O
[SEP]
I O
like O
how O
she O
was O
the O
one O
to O
use O
the O
word O
“abuser” O
when O
you O
asked O
if O
his O
behavior O
was O
consistent. O
And O
then O
she O
was O
mad O
that O
you O
cared O
about O
what O
she O
would O
label O
as O
abuse O
if O
it O
happened O
to O
her. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
wish O
I O
cared O
more O
about O
her O
outcomes, O
but O
you O
can’t O
fix O
this O
sort O
of O
thinking O
for O
her, O
and O
it’s O
probably O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
of O
her O
own O
volition O
for O
years, O
likely O
once O
there O
are O
children O
involved. O
I O
hope O
he’s O
impotent, O
I O
guess. O
It O
would O
be O
best O
to O
let O
her O
know O
that O
you’ll O
be O
around O
if O
she O
leaves O
and O
then O
focus O
on O
other O
things O
until O
that O
day. O
[SEP]
If O
he O
hadn't O
done O
that O
he O
will. O
That O
is O
never O
ok. O
[SEP]
Don’t O
let O
him O
in O
your O
house. O
Don’t O
go O
near O
him O
again. O
[SEP]
I’m O
so O
sorry O
but O
your O
sister O
is O
definitely O
in O
an O
abusive O
relationship. O
She O
is O
just O
not O
ready O
to O
see O
it. O
But O
now O
you O
do O
so O
maybe O
that O
will O
help. O
[SEP]
Rememer O
that O
SHE O
called O
him O
an O
abuser O
not O
you. O
Projection O
fo O
sho O
and O
she O
may O
be O
asking O
for O
help O
without O
asking O
for O
help. O
Keep O
an O
eye O
on O
it! O
[SEP]
Congratulations O
your O
sister O
is O
shit. O
You O
don't O
need O
her O
[SEP]
He’s O
clearly O
unhinged O
and O
your O
sister O
sounds O
like O
a O
fucking O
mop O
[SEP]
WHAT O
THE O
FUCKKK😭😭😭😭😭 O
[SEP]
You're O
place O
your O
rules. O
An O
if O
he O
can't O
be O
an O
adult O
he O
can O
get O
the O
fuck O
out. O
And O
he O
most O
definitely O
dose O
the O
same O
with O
your O
sister. O

My B-Family
mom, I-Family
my I-Family
dad I-Family
and I-Family
I I-Family
are I-Family
all I-Family
caffeine I-Family
addicts I-Family
and O
none O
of O
us O
have O
thrown O
objects O
at O
each O
other O
because O
we O
were O
"cranky O
for O
coffee". O
The O
man's O
behaviour O
is O
ludicrous O
and O
so O
is O
your O
sisters O
justification O
of O
it. O
I'd O
give O
her O
an O
ultimatum O
since O
she O
clearly O
loves O
living O
in O
denial. O
[SEP]
Yea O
I O
drink O
caffeine O
every O
day O
and O
I’ve O
never O
assaulted O
someone O
because O
I O
didn’t O
have O
it, O
he O
isn’t O
an O
addict O
he’s O
just O
a O
piece O
of O
shit. O
I’m O
really O
tired O
of O
people O
using O
addictions O
as O
an O
excuse O
to O
act O
shitty O
[SEP]
If O
that's O
his O
reaction O
over O
something O
as O
petty O
as O
coffee, O
imagine O
what O
he's O
like O
with O
things O
that O
actually O
matter. O
Dude O
sounds O
like O
a O
ticking O
time O
bomb. O
[SEP]
Clearly O
he O
has. O
Out O
on O
his O
ass O
he O
goes. O
[SEP]
Make O
sure O
you O
tell O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family! O
[SEP]
I’m O
a O
caffeine O
addict, O
but O
all O
I O
do O
is O
grumble, O
drink O
some O
water, O
and O
plot O
how O
to O
get O
the O
sweet O
nectar O
of O
the O
gods. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
turn O
into O
an O
overgrown O
toddler O
mad O
because O
someone O
took O
away O
my O
favorite O
toy. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If, O
for O
some O
bizarre O
reason O
I O
did O
throw O
a O
temper O
tantrum, O
my O
husband O
would O
be O
gone O
faster O
than O
a O
cat O
at O
a O
dog O
show. O
[SEP]
Yes. O
He O
has O
done O
stuff O
like O
that O
to O
her. O

a I-Wife_GF
plate I-Wife_GF
at I-Wife_GF
my I-Wife_GF

I O
definitely O

defending O
her O
behaviour O
[SEP]
Uh.... O
I'd O
of O
cracked O
the O
fucker O
in O
the O
face O
with O
a O
frying O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Neither O
my O

her O
asshole O
would O
be O
allowed O
in O
my O
house O
after O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
What O
the O
fuck. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
fact O
that O
your O
sister O
got O
defensive O
when O
you O
asked O
if O
he O
had O
ever O
done O
that O
to O
her O
means O
yes O
he O
has O
100% O
done O
that O
to O
her O
and O
she's O
normalized O
it. O
[SEP]
>She O
knows O
my O
main O
account O
so O
this O
is O
a O
throwaway O
account. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Ah O
yes, O
very O
clever, O
she'll O
never O
find O
out O
now O
[SEP]
She's O
totally O
being O
abused. O
[SEP]
Coffee O
and O
meth O
are O
not O
the O
same O
[SEP]
Wow O
imagine O
what O
he O
does O
to O
your O
sister. O
You O
need O
to O
get O
your O
parents O
if O
you O
can O
and O
get O
her O
outta O
there O
[SEP]
Should O
have O
punched O
him O
[SEP]
that's O
the O
definition O
of O
an O
abuser. O
consult O
with O
your O
parents, O
she O
definitely O
needs O
your O
help. O
[SEP]
He’s O
already O
proven O
he’s O
an O
abuser. O
If O
your O
sister O
thinks O
this O
is O
acceptable O
behavior, O
she’s O
a O
willing O
victim. O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
someone O
is O
protecting O
an O
abuser. O
I'm O
guessing O
they've O
been O
together O
for O
a O
while, O
and O
she O
doesn't O
want O
to O
leave O
a O
long O
term O
relationship? O
What O
do O
your O
parents/siblings O
have O
to O
say O
on O
the O
matter? O
I'm O
kind O
of O
surprised O
you O
didn't O
call O
police O
on O
him, O
that's O
vandalism, O
destruction O
of O
private O
property, O
and O
assault O
(at O
least O
in O
my O
state) O
[SEP]
Oh, O
she O
is O
being O
abused!!! O
Maybe O
not O
physically, O
yet, O
but O
surely O
some O
emotional O
or O
psychological O
abuse. O

who O

caffeine O
is O
not O

a O

i O

its O

Yup O
she's O
abused O
[SEP]
Wow, O
This O
is O
about O
coffee, O
But O
that O
idiot O
guy O
is O
going O
on O
like O
he's O
a O
heroine O
addict, O
Also O
make O
sure O
he O
isn't O
abusing O
your O
sister, O
And O
if O
he O
shouts O
alot, O
Get O
a O
bigger O
guy O
to O
go O
have O
a O
chat O
with O
that O
little O
boy. O
[SEP]
He O
is O
an O
abuser O
throwing O
a O
plate O
at O
someone O
bc O
they O
don’t O
own O
a O
coffee O
maker O
is O
deranged O
and O
abusive. O
You O
need O
to O
tell O
your O
family, O
your O
sister O
is O
most O
likely O
in O
an O
abusive O
relationship O
based O
on O
how O
she O
excused O
his O
horrid O
behavior O
[SEP]
What O
a O
fucking O
man O
child O
I'm O
sure O
he's O
done O
shit O
like O
that O
to O
your O
sister O
and O
that O
is O
ridiculous. O
you O
are O
in O
the O
right O
to O
not O
have O
him O
over O
at O
your O
home O
anymore. O
[SEP]
What O
is O
with O
all O
of O
these O
crybaby O
men O
who O
flip O
out O
and O
start O
throwing O
stuff O
when O
they O
get O
angry? O
The O
situation O
you O
described O
is O
really O
concerning. O
I O
hope O
your O
sister O
will O
come O
to O
her O
senses O
and O
realize O
this O
type O
of O
thing O
could O
and O
likely O
will O
increasingly O
escalate. O
I O
applaud O
you O
for O
being O
as O
calm O
and O
level O
headed O
as O
you O
were. O
[SEP]
He O
probably O
hits O
her O
as O
well. O
☹️ O
[SEP]
You O
need O
to O
check O
that O
dude. O
There’s O
disagreements O
and O
then O
there’s O
just O
being O
disrespectful. O
If O
you O
don’t O
take O
care O
of O
it O
now O
it O
will O
get O
worse. O
[SEP]
Honestly, O
I’d O
press O
charges O
if O
you O
can. O
Though O
I O
imagine O
your O
sister, O
the O
only O
witness, O
would O
lie O
to O
the O
cops O
when O
interrogated. O
Post O
this O
to O
your O
main O
account O
bc O
she O
needs O
to O
see O
that O
no, O
this O
isn’t O
him O
being O
“cranky” O
(is O
he O
a O
fucking O
toddler?!?!), O
it’s O
abuse. O
[SEP]
>I O
asked O
my O
sister O
if O
he's O
ever O
done O
anything O
like O
that O
to O
her O
and O
she O
asked O
if O
I O
was O
calling O
him O
an O
abuser O
and O
got O
angry O
at O
me. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Ok, O
so O
atleast O
your O
sister O
is O
not O
100% O
delusional O
and O
realizes O
that O
plate O
throwing O
falls O
under O
abusive O
behavior. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
>My O
sister O
excused O
him O
by O
saying O
that O
he's O
a O
"caffeine O
addict" O
and O
that O
he O
gets O
"cranky" O
without O
his O
coffee O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
he's O
so O
much O
of O
an O
addict O
that O
he O
has O
no O
control O
over O
his O
own O
actions?? O
And O
your O
sister O
is O
ok O
with O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
would O
advise O
you O
to O
be O
kind O
to O
your O
sister O
and O
provide O
her O
with O
a O
safe O
place O
should O
she O
want O
to O
leave O
him. O
He O
may O
not O
have O
thrown O
things O
at O
her O
but O
he O
is O
definitely O
abusive O
to O
her O
in O
other O
ways, O
and O
she O
can't O
leave. O
[SEP]
Hed O
be O
out O
on O
the O
street O
the O
same O
minute O
he O
threw O
my O
property O
to O
my O
head O
inside O
my O
own O
house. O
[SEP]
Insane O
stuff. O
[SEP]
Well, O
if O
it O
throws O
a O
plate O
like O
an O
abuser... O
[SEP]
Don't O
even O
talk O
to O
the O
prick O
at O
family O
events O
what O
a O
garbage O
person O
[SEP]
That's O
messed O
up. O
I O
am O
a O
caffeine O
addict O
myself O
but O
I O
have O
never O
thrown O
any O
objects O
because O
I O
couldn't O
get O
a O
fix. O
[SEP]
And O
there O
should O
be O
plenty O
of O
ways O
for O
him O
to O
get O
coffee O
without O
resorting O
to O
violence. O
[SEP]
Fuck O
that O
guy! O
[SEP]
He O
might O
be O
abusive O
and O
your O
sister O
is O
still O
in O
denial. O
Do O
not O
let O
him O
back O
in O
your O
house O
again. O
Remain O
firm. O
And O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
your O
sister O
for O
bruises O
or O
anything O
else O
that O
could O
indicate O
he’s O
hurting O
her. O
[SEP]
Damn, O
he’s O
normalized O
this O
behavior O
that O
he O
was O
comfortable O
enough O
to O
do O
it O
to O
you, O
in O
your O
own O
house. O
Tell O
other O
family O
members O
and O
help O
her O
get O
iut O
of O
there O
[SEP]
Yeah O
he's O
kicking O
her O
azz. O
You O
did O
the O
right O
thing. O
If O
sis O
is O
pissed O
she O
should O
stay O
the O
hell O
away O
too. O
What O
sister O
allows O
her O
immature O
boy O
toy O
to O
act O
so O
aggressively O
towards O
her O
own O
sister O
? O
[SEP]
Your O
sister O
is O
100% O
being O
abused O
and O
she's O
in O
the O
idiot O
phase O
of O
it O
now O
- O
which O
is O
denial. O
Tell O
your O
family O
ASAP. O
I O
would O
also O
report O
him. O
[SEP]
Your O
sister O
is O
regarded O
[SEP]
Yeah O
that O
right O
there O
is O
assault. O
A O
crime. O
Tell O
your O
sister O
neither O
of O
them O
are O
ever O
allowed O
back O
there O
and O
should O
be O
more O
grateful O
you O
didn't O
press O
charges O
because O
I O
would O
have O
[SEP]
She's O
probably O
being O
abused O
herself, O
and O
in O
denial O
about O
it O
(thus O
the O
question O
of O
"are O
you O
calling O
him O
an O
abuser?"). O
You're O
absolutely O
justified O
in O
not O
allowing O
him O
around O
you O
any O
more O
- O
that O
was O
in O
no O
way O
acceptable. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I'm O
sorry O
that O
you're O
going O
through O
that O
- O
I O
hope O
you O
can O
stay O
in O
contact O
with O
your O
sister. O
She'll O
probably O
need O
it. O
If O
he's O
comfortable O
enough O
to O
do O
something O
like O
that O
around O
you, O
imagine O
how O
he O
acts O
around O
her. O
It O
might O
be O
worth O
it O
to O
ask O
her O
who O
else O
is O
calling O
him O
an O
abuser O
- O
but O
make O
sure O
she O
knows O
that O
you O
love O
her O
and O
are O
going O
to O
be O
there O
for O
HER, O
just O
not O
HIM. O
He O
may O
already O
be O
trying O
to O
isolate O
her O
from O
her O
support O
network. O
After O
all, O
that's O
what O
abusers O
do. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Stay O
safe, O
OP. O
[SEP]
"I'm O
withdrawing O
from O
my O
socially O
accepted O
addiction O
so O
I O
have O
a O
pass O
yo O
assault O
you." O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Fuck. O
That. O
[SEP]
If O
the O
sister O
is O
rationalizing O
that O
type O
of O
behavior… O
eek. O
She’s O
either O
as O
bad O
as O
him O
or O
is O
desensitized O
because O
he O
always O
is O
like O
this/abuses O
her O
(the O
latter O
feels O
more O
likely). O
That O
is O
a O
level O
ten O
reaction O
to O
a O
non-infraction. O
I O
hope O
you’re O
okay, O
OP. O
[SEP]
Holy O
shit O
if O
he O
has O
the O
gumption O
to O
do O
this O
to O
you, O
imagine O
what O
he’s O
doing O
to O
your O
sister O
behind O
closed O
doors. O
This O
is O
not O
cranky. O
This O
is O
abusive O
and O
batshit O
crazy. O
[SEP]
Thays O
beyond O
being O
cranky O
about O
not O
getting O
caffeine. O
That O
was O
a O
tantrum O
how O
big O
a O
deal O
would O
it O
be O
to O
just O
go O
get O
some O
at O
a O
gas O
station O
or O
something? O
[SEP]
Call O
it O
what O
it O
is. O
He's O

He’s O
an O

[SEP]
Dude... O
[SEP]
I O

you're O
so O
in O
the O
right O
I O
don't O
have O
much O
to O
add O

I'm O
worried O
about O
your O
sister O
[SEP]
Get O
a O
fucking O
coffee O
maker, O
not O
rocket O
science O
[SEP]
This O
was O
my O
first O
thought O
too. O
There O
are O
plenty O
of O
places O
to O
grab O
coffee. O
Hell, O
the O
airport O
will O
have O
it O
if O
you O
don't O
pass O
one O
of O
the O
other O
dozen O
places O
you O
can O
buy O
a O
cup O
on O
the O
way. O
[SEP]
Should O
have O
called O
the O
police O
for O
assault. O
[SEP]
That O
definetly O
is O
abusive O
behaviours. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
also O
get O
cranky O
when O
I O
don\`t O
get O
coffee O
in O
the O
morning. O
You O
know O
what O
I O
do? O
I O
would O
look O
if O
I O
could O
get O
one O
somewhere O
else O
and O
if O
not O
I O
sulk O
inside O
myself O
for O
like O
5 O
minutes O
and O
then O
I O
get O
over O
it O
and O
move O
on. O
[SEP]
Yup O
she O
got O
Stockholm O
[SEP]
Yup. O
She O
didn’t O
answer O
the O
question O
with O
“No, O
never!”, O
she O
answered O
it O
with O
another O
question. O
Way O
to O
dance O
around O
the O
obvious. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
OP, O
you O
need O
to O
make O
yourself O
available O
to O
sister O
if O
ever O
she O
needs O
help O
getting O
away. O
[SEP]
Exactly. O
The O
bf O
is O
an O
abusive O
idiot O
and O
there O
is O
a O
big O
chance O
the O
sister O
is O
in O
denial O
of O
being O
abused. O
Could O
help O
to O
open O
her O
eyes. O
[SEP]
She's O
an O
abuse O
victim O
a O
d O
I'd O
be O
surprised O
if O
he O
doesn't O
already O
beat O
her O
[SEP]
Me O
too, O
except O
privately...no O
coffee O
means O
I O
have O
a O
legitimate O
excuse O
to O
go O
out O
for O
expresso. O
Out O
of O
milk? O
Guess O
I'll O
need O
to O
pop O
out O
and O
grab O
a O
cappuccino! O
[SEP]
My O
first O
thought, O
too. O
Like O
how O
many O
people’s O
sister’s O
boyfriends O
have O
thrown O
plates O
at O
their O
heads O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
coffeemaker? O
Can’t O
be O
more O
than O
half O
a O
dozen. O
I O
think O
sister O
may O
make O
the O
connection O
here… O
[SEP]
Missing O
the O
point O
here O
[SEP]
Damn O
bro O
completely O
over O
your O
head O
huh O
🤔 O
[SEP]
Possibly O
assault O
with O
deadly O
force. O
A O
lot O
of O
states O
consider O
blunt O
force O
trauma O
to O
the O
head O
the O
same O
level O
of O
deadly O
force O
as O
shooting O
someone. O
[SEP]
I O
thought O
the O
exact O
same O
thing. O
[SEP]
100% O
this O
make O
them O
late O
for O
the O
flight O
[SEP]
Sulk O
inside O
myself O
- O
hilarious, O
I’m O
taking O
it O
[SEP]
I O
sulk O
when O
I O
run O
out O
of O
coffee O
too. O
[SEP]
Nah, O
that O
was O
the O
plate O
that O
got O
thrown O
at O
her O
for O
NOT O
HAVING O
A O
COFFEE O
MACHINE O
[SEP]
Yeah O
it O
sucks.. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Happy O
cake O
day! O
[SEP]
Lol O
but O
why O
would O
she O
have O
one O
if O
she O
doesn’t O
drink O
coffee? O
[SEP]
To O
avoid O
getting O
plates O
thrown O
at O
her O

It’s O
quite O
cute O
that O
at O
28, O
you O
say O
you O
are O
young, O
but O
getting O
old. O
I O
assure O
you, O
28 O
is O
still O
young, O
young! O
This O
is O
the O
time O
to O
live O
your O

If O
there’s O
a O
little O
dream O
in O
your O
heart O
to O
have O
the O
trendy O
condo O
in O
the O
big O
city O
(been O
there, O
done O
that, O
forever O
grateful O
I O
did), O
then O
do O
that! O
I B-Location
moved I-Location
to I-Location
London, I-Location
UK I-Location
when B-Age
I I-Age
was I-Age
24, I-Age
worked B-Occupation
for I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
fashion I-Occupation
photographer, I-Occupation
dated B-Relationship_Status
foreign I-Relationship_Status
men, I-Relationship_Status
weekends O
in O
Paris, O
etc. O
Glad O
I O
did O
it, O
and O
it O
also O
made O
me O
more O
comfortable O
now O
with O
a O
slower O
pace O
of O
life, O
having O
that O
out O
of O
the O
system. O
I O
believe O
you O
have O
a O
desire O
for O
exploration O
of O
yourself O
for O
a O
reason. O
If O
you O
want O
to O
take O
emotions O
out O
of, O
statistically, O
majority O
of O
people O
end O
up O
married, O
and O
most O
with O
a O
family, O
so O
that O
dream O
is, O
in O
a O
sense, O
almost O
inevitable, O
unless O
it’s O
something O
you O
choose O
not O
to O
partake O
in. O
However, O
the O
dream O
of O
the O
big O
city O
is O
not O
something O
that O
will O
happen O
unless O
you O
actively O
seek O
it O
out. O
Much O
easier O
(and O
way O
more O
fun) O
to O
do O
in O
your O
late O
20’s, O
then O
never O
have O
done O
it, O
and O
truly O
to O
re-live O
it O
later O
in O
life. O
Not O
to O
say O
it O
can’t O
happen, O
but O
it O
will O
likely O
be O
harder. O
Neither O
choice O
is O
“wrong” O
but O
think O
of O
which O
one O
might O
be O
easier O
to O
pivot O
from, O
should O
you O
wish O
to. O

the O

someone O

seem O

Or O
some O

it’s O
only O
worth O

they O

a O

From O
a O
different, O
more O
practical O
standpoint: O
what’s O
the O
plan O
with O
your O
house? O
Are O
you O
expected O
to O
sell O
it? O
Is O
the O
expectation O
that O
you’d O
use O
that O
money O
on O
a O
down O
payment O
on O
a O
joint O
place? O
I O
100% O
recommend O
against O
commingling O
long O
term O
investments O
in O
your O
future, O
like O
real O
estate, O
with O
someone O
you O
are O
not O
married O
to. O
This O
could O
become O
a O
real O
nightmare O
if O
you O
were O
to O
separate. O
You’re O
a O
homeowner O
at O
28, O
have O
given O
yourself O
a O
big O
financial O
advantage, O
and O
I’m O
not O
really O
seeing O
how O
leaving O
that O
puts O
you O
ahead O
any. O

I O

I O

I O
HAVE O
BEEN O
THERE. O
I'm O
sure O
every O
teacher O
felt O
that O
in O
their O
first O
year. O
I O
became O
so O
mentally O
exhausted O
in O
my O
first O
year O
that O
I O
became O
physically O
ill O
and O
ended O
up O
having O
a O
short O
hospital O
stay. O
A O
lot O
of O
the O
comments O
here O
suggest O
not O
working O
beyond O
contracted O
hours. O
I O
don't O
find O
this O
feasible; O
the O
days O
are O
less O
stressful O
when O
you O
are O
prepared. O
Instead O
of O
this, O
I O
would O
suggest O
setting O
an O
end O
time O
for O
your O
day. O
My O
day O
ends O
at O
3:12 O
and O
I O
allow O
myself O
to O
work O
until O
4:30 O
and O
then O
I O
go O
home. O
Being O
your O
first O
year, O
you O
are O
likely O
going O
to O
need O
more O
time. O
Other O
things O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
are: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
don't O
have O
to O
mark O
everything. O
Choose O
your O
key O
assessment O
pieces. O
Depending O
on O
the O
grade, O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
work O
is O
practice. O
Sometimes O
I'll O
choose O
one O
question O
on O
an O
assignment O
that O
best O
reflects O
the O
learning O
outcome, O
and O
score O
only O
that O
question. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It's O
okay O
to O
give O
yourself O
some O
quiet O
time. O
Your O
students O
can O
do O
silent O
reading O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
you O
can O
take O
a O
breather O
if O
you O
need O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Don't O
reinvent O
the O
wheel. O
Reach O
out O
to O
other O
teachers O
in O
your O
school O
or O
district O
and O
ask O
if O
they O
have O
resources O
or O
lesson O
plans O
that O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
share. O
Sure O
a O
lesson O
might O
not O
be O
perfect O
but O
if O
you're O
already O
overwhelmed O
it's O
better O
than O
burning O
out. O
The O
kids O
will O
not O
suffer O
because O
you O
don't O
have O
a O
perfect O
lesson O
plan O
every O
time. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
like O
the O
other O
comments O
say, O
don't O
worry O
too O
much O
about O
extra O
curricular O
things. O
Pick O
one. O
You O
don't O
have O
to O
be O
a O
hero O
and O
stretch O
yourself O
thin. O

First O

This O
field O
is O
under-valued O

over-worked. O
You're O
always, O
always, O
always O
within O
your O
rights O
to O
say O
"fuck O
this" O

go O
home. O
Being O
a O
teacher O
isn't O
a O
"calling," O
it O
isn't O
a O
path O
to O
"saving O
the O
world." O
It's O
something O
you O
do O
to O
put O
food O
on O
the O
table O
and O
money O
in O
your O
pension O
account. O
So O
don't O
feel O
any O
shame O
if O
you O
decide O
that O
this O
isn't O
for O
you. O

**If O

some O
of O

over O

you'll O
finish O
your O

If O
you O
stay O
in O
the O
same O
content O
area O
for O
a O
while O
(which O
I O
advise) O
you'll O
expand O
your O
bank O
of O
activities O
and O
teaching O
resources, O
which O
will O
streamline O
your O
planning O
time O
considerably. O
If O
you O
stay O
in O
the O
same O
building, O
you'll O
develop O
a O
sense O
for O
which O
tasks O
are O
avoidable O
bullshit, O
which O
tasks O
are O

**Remember, O
they O
need O
you O
more O
than O
you O
need O
them.** O
Admin, O
students, O
parents, O
and O
society O
at O
large O
WILL O
try O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
your O
efforts O
and O
accomplishments O
as O
a O
teacher O
are O
insufficient. O
Ignore O
them. O
These O
people O
literally O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
they're O
talking O
about O
and O
they O
would O
collapse O
if O
placed O
in O
your O
shoes. O
Sometimes, O
other O
teachers O
will O
try O
to O
tear O
you O
down. O
Ignore O
them, O
too. O
They're O
just O
bitter O
fucks O
trying O
to O
assuage O
their O
own O
anxiety. O
**The O
fact O
that O
you O

you've O

There's O
absolutely O
no O

any O

**Some O
practical O
tips O
for O
your O
well-being:** O
Buy O
a O
slowcooker. O
Fill O
it O
1x O
every O
day O
or O
two O
with O
enough O
beans, O
rice, O
and O
frozen O
veggies O
to O
make O
as O
many O
meals O
as O
you'll O
need. O
It'll O
get O
a O
bit O
repetitive O
but O
it's O
easy O
to O
clean, O
nutritious, O
and O
having O
a O
hot O
filling O
meal O
every O
day O
will O
comfort O
you O
in O
a O
way O
that O
microwave O
meals O
will O
not. O
If O
you're O
a O
coffee O
drinker, O
consider O
buying O
a O
few O
bottles O
of O
cold O
brew O
each O
week O
for O
mornings O
when O
you're O
too O
tired O
to O
brew O
a O
fresh O
pot. O

As O
a O
teacher O
of O
16 O
years, O
I O
feel O
you. O
If O
I O
could O
go O
back, O
I’d O
pick O
a O
different O
career. O
Wish O
you O
well. O
[SEP]
I B-Occupation
had I-Occupation
to I-Occupation
quit I-Occupation
teaching I-Occupation
after B-Other
becoming I-Other
a I-Other
mother. I-Other
I O
couldn’t O
be O
good O
at O
both. O
I O
found O
that O
it O
never O
got O
that O
much O
easier O
over O
the O
years. O
Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
district O
I O
worked O
in O
that O
was O
the O
problem O
though. O
[SEP]
Yo! O
I’m B-Occupation
also I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
first I-Occupation
year I-Occupation
teacher I-Occupation
and O
finishing B-Education
my I-Education
masters I-Education
and I-Education
going I-Education
through I-Education
Induction. I-Education
So O
I O
feel O
your O
pain. O
There’s O
literally O
no O
time O
left O
in O
the O
day O
to O
breathe. O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
let O
you O
know, O
that O
you’re O
not O
the O
only O
one!! O
[SEP]
People O
always O
say O
to O
“just O
work O
contract O
hours O
and O
you’ll O
figure O
it O
out O
when O
you O
get O
there O
the O
next O
day”, O
but O
it’s O
a O
little O
more O
challenging O
to O
figure O
it O
out O
the O
morning O
of O
when O
you’re O
a O
new O
teacher O
have O
no O
fucking O
clue O
on O
what O
you’re O
doing, O
the O
lesson O
you’re O
teaching, O
or O
how O
to O
manage O
a O
class. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
One O
suggestion O
that O
has O
really O
saved O
me, O
is O
that O
if O
you O
know O
any O
teachers O
in O
the O
district O
that O
teach O
the O
same O
thing O
as O
you, O
don’t O
be O
ashamed O
to O
ask O
for O
all O
of O
the O
stuff O
they O
have O
and O
their O
planning O
methods. O
Finding O
ways O
to O
“cheat” O
the O
system O
and O
not O
create O
things O
from O
scratch O
helps. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
want O
to O
DM O
me O
and O
we O
can O
vent O
to O
each O
other, O
feel O
free! O
[SEP]
First O
year O
teachers O
are O
given O
more O
sick O
days O
than O
veteran O
teachers O
in O
most O
districts. O
And O
that’s O
for O
a O
reason. O
You O
are O
expected O
to O
feel O
run O
down O
you O
first O
few O
years O
as O
you O
build O
up O
your O
immunity O
to O
all O
the O
germs O
and O
the O
energy O
coming O
at O
you O
all O
day O
/ O
every O
day. O
It O
gets O
better. O
Use O
those O
days. O
Not O
more O
than O
once O
a O
month. O
And O
not O
the O
months O
with O
many O
days O
off. O
You O
don’t O
want O
to O
be O
spoken O
to O
for O
attendance. O
I O
take O
a O
mental O
health O
day O
in O
October, O
sometime O
between O
January O
and O
February O
and O
again O
between O
March O
and O
summer. O
This O
stretch O
your O
in O
is O
the O
longest. O
Christmas O
break O
is O
around O
the O
corner. O
This O
is O
my O
17th O
year O
and O
feel O
you O
with O
the O
exhaustion. O
But O
that’s O
because O
I O
taught O
my O
day O
class, O
afternoon O
class, O
and O
night O
classes O
today O
as O
I O
do O
every O
M/W. O
This O
exhaustion O
is O
temporary. O
You’ll O
build O
up O
your O
stamina. O
Message O
me O
if O
you’d O
like O
to O
chat. O
[SEP]
Okay, O
if O
you O
could O
postpone O
grad O
school, O
do O
it. O
That’s O
too O
much O
right O
there. O
First O
year O
teaching O
is O
hard O
enough. O
You O
don’t O
want O
anything O
else O
on O
your O
plate. O
I O
waited O
until O
year O
4 O
to O
begin O
grad O
school. O
I O
b O
wouldn’t O
have O
been O
able O
to O
do O
so O
in O
my O
first O
year. O
[SEP]
Also, O
allow O
yourself O
grace. O
It O
will O
and O
f O
does O
get O
better, O
trust O
me!! O
Don’t O
aim O
for O
perfection. O
Do O
your O
best O
and O
don’t O
try O
to O
do O
it O
all. O
[SEP]
Next O
year O
will O
be O
easier O
because O
you’ll O
have O
classroom O
management O
experience O
and O
lessons O
you’ve O
saved. O
You’ll O
get O
there. O

[SEP]
I O
think O
teaching O
is O
different, O
now. O
The O
workload O
is O
astronomical, O
and O
the O
schools O
operate O
like O
cults O
that O
demand O
every O
minute O
of O
your O
time, O
including O
unpaid O
time. O
While O
grad O
school O
is O
difficult O
to O
do O
while O
you're O
teaching O
(I O
did O
this O
early O
on O
in O
my O
career.), O
something O
strange O
and O
concerning O
is O
happening O
in O
education. O
The O
role O
I O
once O
held O
has O
become O
so O
untenable, O
I O
resigned O
from O
my O
district O
recently O
due O
to O
multiple O
instances O
of O
toxic O
work O
environment. O
It O
seems O
my O
role O
now O
includes O
being O
bullied, O
and O
Idk O
if O
it O
is O
falling O
down O
the O
stairs O
at O
work, O
being O
evaluated O
by O
admin O
with O
no O
teaching O
experience, O
getting O
covid O
and O
subsequent O
struggles O
with O
cognition, O
fatigue, O
mood O
regulation, O
and O
joint O
pain, O
lock O
down O
drills, O
being O
falsely O
accused O
of O
abuse, O
being O
underpaid O
commensurate O
with O
my O
experience O
by O
administration, O
but O
it O
hardly O
seems O
worth O
all O
this O
effort, O
anymore. O
I O
am O
searching O
for O
the O
next O
thing, O
as O
this O
teaching O
business O
doesn't O
seem O
like O
something O
I O
want O
to O
participate O
in, O
anymore...it O
seems O
like O
post-pandemic, O
the O
expectations O
are O
outrageous O
on O
the O
part O
of O
school O
officials. O
I O
don't O
care O
for O
this O
trend O
of O
hiring O
bullies O
and O
retaining O
bullies O
into O
high O
positions, O
either. O
It's O
as O
if O
the O
powers O
that O
be O
want O
to O
intentionally O
fuck O
the O
kids O
up O
by O
exposing O
them O
to O
assholes O
all O
day O
so O
that O
they O
wind O
up O
in O
one O
of O
their O
prisons O
or O
mental O
hospitals.. O
[SEP]
That's O
because O
you're O
always O
*on* O
when O
you're O
teaching. O
No O
spacing O
out O
and O
dicking O
around O
on O
your O
phone, O
no O
time O
to O
breathe. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Look O
into O
meal O
prep O
and O
try O
doing O
it O
on O
your O
weekends. O
A O
slow O
cooker, O
Instant O
Pot, O
and/or O
air O
fryer O
are O
your O
best O
friends O
for O
low O
effort O
cooking. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also O
try O
building O
in O
group O
work O
and O
independent O
work O
time O
to O
give O
yourself O
and O
your O
students O
breaks. O
[SEP]
it O
gets O
better. O
My O
first O
years O
was O
very O
similar. O
the O
first O
6 O
months O
is O
the O
absolute O
worst. O
next O
year O
will O
be O
measurably O
better O
and O
year O
three O
i O
finally O
felt O
like O
i O
was O
teaching O
and O
doing O
well. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
manage O
your O
expectation. O
teaching O
is O
a O
skill. O
it O
helped O
me O
to O
focus O
on O
getting O
better O
in O
specific O
areas O
instead O
of O
just O
being O
sad/angry O
that O
i O
was O
wasnt O
good O
[SEP]
[SEP]
i O
used O
to O
just O
take O
a O
nap O
after O
work O
for O
about O
25 O
minutes O
just O
so O
i O
could O
do O
stuff. O
[SEP]
Almost O
no O
one O
ever O
becomes O
a O
"good" O
teacher. O
What O
is O
asked O
of O
us, O
especially O
in O
this O
country, O
is O
essentially O
impossible O
to O
do O
well. O
So O
be O
realistic O
and O
accept O
that O
you O
are O
just O
learning O
to O
become O
the O
best O
teacher O
you O
can O
be. O
Don't O
try O
to O
be O
perfect O
and O
certainly O
don't O
worry O
too O
much O
about O
what O
the O
staff O
and O
faculty O
think O
of O
you O
as O
a O
"teacher". O
If O
you O
do O
this, O
you O
will O
work O
yourself O
into O
the O
ground O
(likely O
with O
little O
to O
no O
reward). O
Stick O
to O
your O
core O
values O
as O
a O
person O
and O
as O
a O
teacher. O
Be O
faithful O
to O
these O
and O
you O
will O
naturally O
gain O
the O
right O
skills O
for O
YOU O
to O
build O
the O
type O
of O
classroom O
culture O
YOU O
dream O
of! O
Over O
time, O
probably O
after O
several O
years, O
you O
will O
see O
things O
come O
together. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
a O
first O
year, O
you O
will O
probably O
fuck O
up O
a O
lot. O
Observe O
your O
coworkers O
when O
you O
can O
(even O
if O
it's O
just O
hearing O
them O
out O
at O
staff O
meetings O
or O
checking O
out O
how/what O
they've O
decorated O
their O
classrooms O
with). O
Take O
note O
of O
what O
inspires O
you, O
try O
out O
their O
approaches. O
Take O
note O
of O
what O
they O
do O
that O
you O
notice O
doesn't O
work O
too! O
(Especially O
things O
the O
students O
react/respond O
poorly O
to.) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Work O
within O
your O
work O
hours. O
Remember O
that O
playing O
with O
your O
cat O
is O
more O
important O
than O
volunteering/giving O
free O
labor O
to O
work. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Bask O
in O
your O
graduate O
education. O
There O
should O
be O
several O
tools O
and O
philosophies O
you O
learn O
there O
too. O
Just O
copy O
and O
paste O
for O
now O
to O
apply O
to O
classroom. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Sorry O
my O
writing O
is O
all O
over O
the O

I O
hope O
you O
feel O
better O
soon! O
Keep O
asking O
for O
support! O
[SEP]
My O
first O
year O
I O
came O
home O
and O
napped O
most O
days. O
I O
slept O
in O
the O
staff O
lounge O
sometimes. O
I O
wasn't O
used O
to O
a O
job O
that O
had O
me O
get O
up O
this O
early, O
let O
alone O
the O
sheer O
energy O
it O
takes. O
Year O
two O
was O
a O
lot O
better. O
Just O
give O
yourself O
room O
this O
year O
and O
try O
to O
set O
boundaries O
and O
not O
do O
extra O

school O
a O
little O
slower. O
There’s O
no O
use O
in O
torturing O
yourself! O
[SEP]
Your O
first O
year O
is O
impossible. O
It O
is O
hell. O
I O
can’t O
imagine O
what O
it O
would O
be O
like O
with O
grad O
school O
on O
top O
of O
it. O
But O
it O
gets O
a O
lot O
easier O
once O
you O
build O
up O
your O
foundation O
of O
lessons O
and O
material O
(and O
once O
you O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
prioritize O
what O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
and O
what O
is O
optional). O
[SEP]
I O
can O
relate. O
I O
have O
a O
second O
job, O
required O
college O
classes O
to O
earn O
my O
license, O
a O
new O
baby, O
a O
special O
needs O
dog O
and O
my O
teenager O
is O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
ass. O
With O
that O
being O
said, O
your O
struggle O
is O
real. O
It’s O
not O
easy. O
As O
a O
teacher, O
you O
are O
mentally O
engaged O
for O
8 O
hours O
a O
day. O
Most O
workers O
have O
maybe O
4 O
hours O
of O
real O
mental O
engagement. O
Sleeping O
8-9 O
hours O
a O
night O
is O
a O
blessing O
though. O
From O
a O
compensation O
and O
inflation O
perspective, O
I O
suspect O
many O
of O
us O
are O
not O
eating O
well. O
Treat O
yourself O
to O
something O
nice, O
don’t O
be O
hard O
on O
yourself. O
You O
are O
winning, O
even O
though O
it’s O
hard! O
[SEP]
The O
first O
year O
is O
so O
hard. O
You’ve O
gotten O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
advice O
here. O
Please O
prioritize O
yourself—you O
are O
worth O
it O
and O
I O
find O
I’m O
a O
better O
teacher O
when O
I O
do. O
Thinking O
of O
you! O
[SEP]
I O
recommend O
Western O
Governors O
U O
for O
grad O
school. O
6 O
months, O
$3750 O
out O
the O
door. O
Accredited. O
[SEP]
I'm O
in O
my O
second O
year, O
and O
an O
attitude O
shift O
has O
done O
wonders O
for O
my O
mental O
health. O
Basically, O
just O
let O
go O
and O
accept O
the O
fact O
that O
you'll O
never O
feel O
"caught O
up." O
You O
will O
always O
have O
a O
huge O
backlog O
of O
things O
which O
need O
to O
get O
done, O
and O
that's O
okay. O
And O
if O
you're O
a O
perfectionist, O
you're O
gonna O
need O
to O
get O
over O
that, O
too. O
Part O
of O
that O
is O
learning O
to O
selectively O
tune O
out O
the O
nonstop O
drumbeat O
from O
grad O
school, O
admin, O
PDs, O
etc. O
that O
every O
single O
thing O
we O
do O
is O
ultra-important O
and O
every O
single O
lesson O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
Danielson O
masterpiece O
(or O
substitute O
in O
whatever O
rubric O
your O
district O
uses). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Oh, O
and O
sometimes O
it's O
perfectly O
fine O
to O
"wing O
it." O
Not O
every O
day, O
but O
if O
you O
ever O
go O
to O
bed O
at O
night O
thinking, O
"I O
know O
the O
material O
for O
tomorrow's O
lesson O
through O
and O
through, O
I O
know O
exactly O
what O
we're O
going O
to O
do O
and O
how O
we're O
going O
to O
do O
it," O
guess O
what? O
You're O
finished O
with O
your O
lesson O
plan! O
Congratulations! O
[SEP]
I O
personally O
love O
factor O
meals O
they O
are O
healthy O
and O
the O
food O
is O
ready O
in O
2 O
minutes. O
It’s O
90$ O
a O
week O
for O
6 O
meals O
and O
they O
have O
cheaper O
plans O
too. O
[SEP]
I’m O
not O
sure O
what O
grade O
or O
subject O
you O
teach, O
but O
something O
that O
saved O
me O
a O
ton O
of O
time O
and O
stress O
was O
making O
an O
agenda O
slide O
for O
each O
day O
in O
a O
running O
slide O
deck. O
If O
I O
couldn’t O
get O
around O
to O
lesson O
plans O
(eventually O
just O
stopped O
doing O
them) O
I O
would O
at O
the O
very O
least O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
agenda. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Build O
in O
classroom O
time O
that’s O
independent O
work O
for O
the O
kids. O
Like O
15 O
mins O
of O
independent O
reading O
per O
day, O
15 O
mins O
on O
an O
online O
math O
program, O
something O
self O
directed. O
That O
gives O
you O
some O
breathing O
room O
during O
each O
class/block O
to O
either O
chill O
or O
get O
stuff O
done. O
Sometimes O
I O
would O
pay O
my O
bills O
online O
while O
they O
were O
reading. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Remember O
not O
everything O
has O
to O
be O
graded. O
Don’t O
tell O
the O
kids O
that. O
But O
yeah O
a O
random O
worksheet O
or O
discussion O
post… O
trash O
it. O
[SEP]
I’m O
so O
sorry O
you O
are O
going O
through O
this. O
One O
idea O
that O
helped O
me O
was O
you O
don’t O
owe O
your O
life O
to O
any O
job. O
[SEP]
First O
year O
teacher O
here O
on O
an O
alt O

doing O
community O
college O
classes O
to O
get O
my O
full O

and O
I O
feel O
you. O
You O
are O
not O
alone!! O
I O
also O
take O
no O
work O
home O
most O
days O
(except O
for O
essay O
grading... O
English O
is O
rough O
for O
grading) O
and O
can't O
muster O
up O
energy O
to O
do O
more O
than O
sit O
and O
watch O
TV. O
I O
fall O
asleep O
with O
the O
lights O
on O
in O
my O
work O
clothes. O
It O
is O
tough O
and O
I O
don't O
have O
any O
tips O
for O
you, O
just O
wanted O
you O
to O
know O
I'm O
right O
there O
with O
you. O
Some O
things O
are O
getting O
easier O
and O
I O
just O
try O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
small O
wins. O
We O
got O
this! O
Christmas O
break O
is O
coming!! O
Take O
care O
of O
yourself. O
I O
lost O
a O
ton O
of O
weight O
first O
quarter O
and O
worry O
about O
keeping O
myself O
fed O
and O
rested. O
Much O
love O
to O
you, O
friend. O
[SEP]
That’s O
showbiz O
baby O
[SEP]
you O
will O
feel O
better O
after O
exercise. O
you O
will O
gain O
some O
of O
your O
life O
back. O
even O
you O
feel O
tired, O
do O
it. O
[SEP]
Work O
only O
contract O
hours, O
take O
nothing O
home. O
Prioritize O
your O
tasks O
during O
your O
planning. O
Take O
a O
“sick” O
day O
if O
you O
need O
it. O
[SEP]
Things O
get O
easier O
as O
you O
learn O
curriculum, O
learn O
to O
run O
a O
classroom, O
etc. O
[SEP]
Go O
to O
a O
doctor O
and O
get O
a O
check O
up. O
I O
was O
really O
tired O
and O
had O
strep O
but O
didn’t O
know O
it. O
You’ll O
get O
your O
energy O
back O
eventually. O
Christmas O
is O
almost O
here. O
Maybe O
evaluate O
your O
house O
systems O
so O
that O
it O
is O
more O
manageable(I O
hate O
folding O
clothes, O
but O
if O
you O
put O
one O
item O
away O
every O
day, O
while O
your O
food O
is O
microwaving, O
it O
will O
be O
one O
less O
thing O
out). O
But O
even O
if O
you O
don’t, O
it’s O
almost O
Christmas. O
You O
can O
rest O
and O
play O
with O
your O
cat. O
[SEP]
First O
off, O
I’m O
so O
sorry; O
honestly, O
just O
like O
everyone O
has O
said, O
the O
first O
year O
is O
so O
hard. O
I O
definitely O
remember O
feeling O
everything O
you’re O
saying O
(especially O
in O
the O
time O
between O
thanksgiving O
and O
Christmas). O
There O
were O
a O
few O
things O
that O
really O
helped O
me O
my O
first O
year O
(and O
continue O
to O
help O
me O
when O
I O
have O
really O
rough O
weeks). O
First, O
I’ve O
always O
been O
a O
runner, O
and O
I O
really O
stopped O
running O
the O
first O
couple O
months O
of O
my O
first O
year. O
I O
started O
making O
myself O
go O
run O
for O
15 O
minutes O
(I O
live O
in O
the O
city O
and O
made O
my O
run O
part O
of O
my O
commute). O
Almost O
immediately, O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
got O
a O
little O
of O
myself O
back; O
it’s O
kind O
of O
wild O
what O
15 O
minutes O
of O
fresh O
air O
and O
exercise O
can O
do. O
I O
also O
got O
really O
into O
meal O
prepping O
on O
the O
weekends; O
I O
tried O
to O
incentivize O
it O
(watching O
shows/movies O
I O
was O
looking O
forward O
to), O
and O
it O
turned O
into O
something O
I O
really O
look O
forward O
to O
even O
years O
later. O
The O
last O
thing O
that O
I O
think O
practically O
made O
a O
big O
difference O
was O
scheduling O
things O
during O
the O
week O
that O
I O
knew O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
and O
then O
sticking O
with O
them. O
It O
can O
feel O
SO O
hard O
and O
isolating, O
but O
having O
something O
on O
a O
Tuesday O
evening O
that O
meant O
I O
literally O
couldn’t O
stay O
at O
work O
until O
6 O
made O
a O
huge O
difference O
for O
me. O
Hope O
some O
of O
that O
helps! O
Mostly, O
you’re O
doing O
great, O
you O
can O
do O
this, O
AND O
you O
don’t O
have O
to O
do O
this. O
Give O
yourself O
grace O
and O
know O
that O
if O
you O
want O
to O
keep O
doing O
this, O
it O
will O
get O
better! O
[SEP]
17 O
years O
in..It O
doesn’t O
change. O
[SEP]
It O
will O
get O
better. O
You O
will O
build O
up O
your O
resources O
and O
not O
have O
to O
spend O
as O
much O
time O
on O
that. O
You O
should O
figure O
out O
the O
best O
way O
for O
you O
to O
be O
as O
organized O
as O
possible O
and O
that O
will O
help. O
As O
you O
get O
more O
comfortable O
in O
lesson O
planning O
you’ll O
get O
time O
back. O
Hang O
in O
there O
it O
really O
is O
worth O
the O
stress. O

is O
something O
I O
look O
at O
every O
year. O
I O
think O
it O
describes O
nearly O
every O
years O
experience O
- O
at O
least O
as O
a O
middle O
school O
teacher. O
Hang O
in O
there O
and O
the O
advice O
from O
u/Southern-Magnolia12 O
is O
golden. O
[SEP]
Something O
that O
has O
helped O
me O
is O
to O
find O
things O
that O
help O
me O
mentally O
reset O
on O
the O
weekend. O
If O
I O
can O
feel O
like O
I O
used O
my O
weekend O
to O
do O
something O
I O
enjoyed, O
was O
restful, O
or O
fun, O
or O
worthwhile O
but O
most O
importantly O
for O
myself O
I O
can O
make O
it O
through O
Wednesday O
on O
that O
feeling. O
After O
that O
I O
hang O
in O
there O
until O
the O
weekend O
again. O
Also O
this O
is O
just O
me O
but O
relaxing O
games O
that O
I O
can O
spend O
hours O
in O
without O
thinking O
about O
anything O
else O
such O
as O
Stardew O
Valley O
or O
Pokemon O
really O
help O
with O
the O
burnout O
when O
I O
get O
home. O
That O
said, O
everything O
is O
still O
a O
mess O
at O
home O
and O
I'm O
still O
not O
eating O
well O
but O
at O
least O
I'm O
not O
miserable O
all O
the O
time. O
[SEP]
First O
year O
teaching O
is O
100% O
always O
the O
worst. O
Eventually, O
it O
DOES O
get O
better. O
Can't O
say O
much O
about O
the O
pay O
though... O
[SEP]
Currently O
a O
well O
seasoned O
teacher O
and O
completing O
grad O
school. O
Would O
highly O
advise O
not O
to O
study O
until O
you O
have O
a O
number O
of O
years O
under O
your O
belt. O
Studying O
is O
important O
but O
can O
you O
move O
it O
just O
a O
few O
years O
so O
you O
can O
settle O
yourself O
first. O
Otherwise O
you O
might O
end O
up O
hating O
a O
career. O
If O
that’s O
not O
possible O
you O
will O
hopefully O
take O
a O
hard O
look O
at O
all O
your O
needs O
and O
commitments O
and O
only O
select O
essentials O
so O
you O
can O
manage. O
It’s O
very O
very O
hard O
in O
your O
first O
year, O
most O
teachers O
will O
be O
able O
to O
sympathize O
with O
you. O
[SEP]
This O
sounds O
like O
burnout, O
you’ve O
been O
working O
yourself O
too O
hard. O
It’s O
very O
common O
in O
this O
profession, O
sadly. O
[SEP]
it O
gets O
better, O
promise. O
the O
2nd O
year O
will O
be O
reasonably O
better O
and O
the O
third O
year O
is O
like O
a O
weight O
is O
lifted O
off O
your O
shoulders. O
You're O
going O
through O
the O
worst O
part O
now… O
See O
it O
through O
and O
the O
pay O
off O
for O
years O
to O
come O
is O
totally O
worth O
it O
[SEP]
Oatmeal O
[SEP]
I O
am O
also O
in O
the O
process O
of O
getting O
masters. O
4th O
year O
teaching O
Art O
(first O
year O
was O
COVID O
year). O
It O
honestly O
does O
get O
better O
.. O
but O
it O
is O
still O
always O
going O
to O
be O
exhausting. O
What O
has O
helped O
me O
greatly O
is O
setting O
strict O
boundaries. O
I O
do O
not O
do O
work O
after O
I O
get O
out O
unless O
it’s O
some O
sort O
of O
urgent O
matter O
like O
grades O
being O
due. O
Use O
your O
time O
efficiently O
while O
at O
work O
and O
most O
importantly, O
let O
go O
of O
having O
everything O
be O
perfect. O
If O
it O
doesn’t O
get O
done, O
then O
it O
doesn’t O
get O
done. O
Oh O
well. O
Also O
for O
food O
I O
find O
that O
buying O
pre O
prepared/seasoned O
meats O
and O
pre O
chopped O
vegetables O
makes O
cooking O
easy. O
Just O
stick O
it O
in O
the O
air O
fryer. O
As O
for O
working O
out, O
aim O
for O
only O
2 O
days O
a O
week. O
As O
long O
as O
you O
are O
moving O
a O
lot O
at O
work O
(which O
I O
know O
we O
are O
a O
lot O
as O
teachers), O
and O
eating O
within O
your O
calorie O
range O
for O
the O
day, O
you O
will O
be O
more O
than O
fine. O
I O
know O
exactly O
how O
you O
feel. O
I O
still O
feel O
this O
way O
sometimes O
but O
then O
I O
just O
tell O
myself O
to O
stop O
caring O
as O
much O
and O
it O
helps O
tremendously. O
[SEP]
This O
was O
me O
last O
year. O
Master's O
program, O
25-mile O
commute O
through O
the O
worst O
traffic O
both O
ways, O
unsupportive O
staff, O
and O
a O
bad O
curriculum. O
It O
fucking O
sucks. O
It O
is O
hard O
and O
you O
are O
suffering O
through O
it. O
I O
totally O
empathize O
with O
your O
situation. O
All O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
is O
that O
this O
year O
is O
way O
easier. O
I O
did O
switch O
schools, O
25 O
miles O
went O
to O
less O
than O
3, O
but O
all O
the O
work O
I O
put O
into O
my O
curriculum O
last O
year O
doesn't O
fully O
translate O
because O
we O
use O
a O
different O
textbook O
and O
materials. O

You're O
going O
to O

way O
what O
does O
and O
doesn't O
work. O
You O
will O
fail O
your O
own O
expectations O
you O
set O
for O
yourself. O
Your O
dishes O
will O
go O
unwashed. O
But O
it O
get O
better. O
I O
don't O
have O
any O
tips O
or O
tricks O
to O
make O
your O
struggle O
easier, O
but O
what O
worked O
for O
me O
was O
have O
a O
solid O
friendship O
with O
my O
mentor O
teacher O
that O
allowed O
me O
to O
voice O
my O
frustrations O
and O
have O
them O
validated. O
This O
will O
be O
the O
hardest O
year O
you O
ever O
teach, O
and O
if O
you O
decide O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
field O
you O
will O
be O
a O
far O
better O
and O
confident O
teacher O
next O
year. O

the O
hard O
way O
what O
does O
and O
doesn't O
work. O
You O
will O
fail O
your O
own O
expectations O
you O
set O
for O
yourself. O
Your O
dishes O
will O
go O
unwashed. O
But O
it O
gets O
better. O
I O
don't O
have O
any O
tips O
or O
tricks O
to O
make O
your O
struggle O
easier, O
but O
what O
worked O
for O
me O
was O
having O
a O
solid O
friendship O
with O
my O
mentor O
teacher O
that O
allowed O
me O
to O
voice O
my O
frustrations O
and O
have O
them O
validated. O
This O
will O
be O
the O
hardest O
year O
you O
ever O
teach, O
and O
if O
you O
decide O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
field O
you O
will O
be O
a O
far O
better O
and O
more O
confident O
teacher O
next O
year.ar.. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
5 O
years O
in O
and O
it O
hasn’t O
gotten O
any O
less O
exhausting. O
Work O
never O
ends.😭 O
[SEP]
Using O
TeachersPayTeachers O
can O
be O
an O
act O
of O
self-care. O
Don’t O
be O
afraid O
to O
ask O
colleagues O
for O
resources O
— O
there’s O
no O
need O
to O
reinvent O
the O
wheel. O
It O
gets O
better, O
I O
promise. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
this O
is O
just O
how O
teaching O
is. O
I’m O
on O
year O
3 O
and O
I O
still O
come O
home O
and O
go O
numb O
in O
front O
of O
the O
tv O
until O
it’s O
time O
to O
go O
to O
bed. O
It’s O
awful, O
it’s O
the O
profession O
[SEP]
We’ve O
all O
been O
there. O
For O
what O
it’s O
worth, O
I’m O
here O
for O
you. O
I O
could O
give O
you O
some O
well O
intentioned O
pat O
advice, O
but O
I O
have O
a O
better O
idea: O
This O
song O
was O
written O
almost O
36 O
years O
ago, O
but O
it O
was O
WRITTEN O
FOR O
YOU. O
it O
is O
the O
most O
inspirational O
song O
I O
have O
ever O
heard. O
And O
I O
was O
a O
music O
teacher! O
When O
I O
feel O
overwhelmed O
and O
emotionally O
drained O
I O
listen O
to O
this O
song O
sometimes O
three O
or O
four O
times O
in O
a O
row. O
I O
can’t O
promise O
that O
it O
will O
make O
you O
feel O
better, O
but O
I O
can O
guarantee O
you O
it O
will O
not O
make O
you O
feel O
worse. O
It O
always O
works O
for O
me. O

I O
really O
hope O
I O
can O
help O
you. O
I O
know O
exactly O
how O
if O
you O
feel. O
[SEP]
Have O
you O
tried O
scheduling O
more O
independent O
work O
for O
the O
kids? O
For O
example, O
they O
can O
grade O
their O
own O
work. O
Take O
that O
time O
to O
just O
breathe O
or O
catch O
up O
on O
planning. O
Also, O
I’ve O
found O
that O
not O
raising O
your O
voice O
or O
addressing O
every O
little O
issue O
has O
done O
wonders O
to O
my O
energy O
levels. O
If O
they’re O
not O
following O
classroom O
expectations, O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
time O
you O
can O
just O
wait. O
They’ll O
correct O
themselves O

Hi, O
3rd O
year O
teacher O
here! O
I O
saw O
your O
comment O
that O
you O
don't O
take O
work O
home O
and O
leave O
at O
contract O
time. O
GOOD. O
That's O
the O
most O
important O
first O
step. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
two O
things O
that O
saved O
me O
my O
first O
year O
was O
taking O
a O
30 O
minute O
cat O
nap O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
home, O
and O
meal O
prepping O
Saturday-Monday. O
I O
only O
cooked O
dinner O
Saturday-Monday O
nights O
but O
I O
make O
enough O
food O
for O
2-3 O
meals. O
This O
way O
I O
had O
healthy O
and O
yummy O
food O
during O
the O
week, O
but O
didn't O
have O
to O
cook O
every O
night! O
The O
nap O
helped O
me O
just O
survive. O
I O
gained O
a O
little O
extra O
energy O
to O
get O
me O
through O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
until O
bed, O
and O
if O
I O
didn't O
nap O
I O
simply O
could O
not O
be O
productive. O
After O
nap, O
I'd O
have O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
or O
half O
caf O
coffee O
and O
get O
on O
with O
my O
evening! O
[SEP]
To O
be O
fair O
with O
how O
terrible O
education O
has O
been O
in O
the O
last O
decade O
only O
those O
that O
are O
gullible O
enough O
are O
left O
teaching. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Welcome O
to O
the O
gullibility O
group. O
[SEP]
I O
got O
some O
ideas/hypotheses O
that O
I O
think O
apply O
to O
two O
root O
factors O
of O
your O
problem O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**Conclusions** O
[SEP]
[SEP]
One O
conclusion O
strongly O
guides O
thinking, O
planning O
and O
decisions. O
For O
example, O
if O
one O
concludes O
"I O
hate O
broccoli", O
he/she O
will O
reject O
broccoli O
and O
any O
food O
make O
with O
it. O
It O
the O
hated O
thing O
is O
a O
person, O
he/she O
will O
not O
want O
to O
interact O
with O
or O
maybe O
even O
stay O
near O
the O
person. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So, O
when O
you O
conclude O
"I O
am O
exhausted", O
this O
has O
an O
effect O
in O
your O
thinking, O
planning O
and O
decisions. O
The O
point O
is: O
is O
it O
fully O
true? O
Consider O
a O
scenario O
that O
you're O
feeling O
extremely O
exhausted O
and O
your O
house O
catches O
fire; O
you O
will O
certainly O
have O
energy O
to O
do O
something. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
simplest O
way O
I O
know O
to O
question O
such O
conclusions O
is O
to O
make O
a O
question O
out O
of O
it: O
"Do O
I O
hate O
broccoli?", O
"Am O
I O
exhausted?" O
Some O
emphasis O
may O
help: O
"Am O
I O
*really, O
completely* O
exhausted??". O
This O
opens O
the O
conclusion O
and O
makes O
it O
easier O
or O
less O
difficult O
to O
do O
something. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**Connections** O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
best O
days O
I O
use O
to O
have O
at O
work O
is O
when O
I O
*complete* O
tasks. O
When O
something O
remains O
pendent O
and O
I O
"take O
it O
home", O
that's O
when O
I O
get O
more O
tired. O
The O
days O
with O
several O
pendencies O
are O
the O
worst. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
have O
*connections* O
to O
things, O
persons, O
problems, O
tasks. O
A O
connection O
is O
associated O
with O
some O
*feeling*. O
When O
we O
complete O
something, O
we O
can O
disconnect O
from O
it; O
we O
don't O
feel O
it O
anymore. O
To O
"take O
a O
task O
home" O
means O
that O
we O
keep O
the O
connection O
with O
the O
task O
active. O
In O
the O
ideal O
scenario, O
we O
keep O
a O
connection O
active O
only O
when O
we O
dedicate O
to O
it; O
an O
active O
connection O
with O
something O
else O
is O
a O
distraction, O
an O
interference. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
that O
you O
are O
"taking O
the O
problems O
home"; O
technically, O
you O
keep O
active O
whatever O
you O
felt O
something O
about. O
In O
other O
words, O
and O
as O
you O
have O
undesirable O
feelings O
about O
your O
experiences, O
you O
keep O
feeding O
the O
connections O
and O
this O
becomes O
a O
cycle. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So, O
what O
to O
do? O
To O
fight O
such O
connections O
is O
a O
lost O
battle, O
they O
are O
reinforced O
by O
the O
attention O
they O
receive. O
Tire O
the O
body O
works O
for O
me, O
but O
sometimes O
a O
get O
into O
a O
state O
similar O
to O
yours O
and O
have O
to O
find O
another O
option. O
The O
simplest O
and O
best O
solution O
to O
me O
is O
to O
connect O
to O
another O
thing, O
for O
example O
some O
activity O
that O
you O
love O
do O
do. O
In O
fact, O
anything O
that O
deviates O
your O
attention O
from O
the O
problem O
will O
work; O
so, O
simply O
*start O
the O
search O
for O
a O
solution* O
is O
a O
step O
in O
the O
right O
direction. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Hope O
this O
helps, O
I'd O
appreciate O
honest O
and O
pitiless O
feedback. O
[SEP]
>Take O
a O
personal/sick O
day O
once O
a O
month O
and O
do O
nothing. O
Work O
only O
your O

Leave O
work O
at O

[SEP]
[SEP]
YES, O

THIS O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
wish O
I O
had O
seen O
this O
comment O
when O
I O
was O
in O
your O
position. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
This O
is O
a O
job O
where O
you O
could O
work O
24hrs O
a O
day O
year-round O
and O
you'll O
still O
never O
be O
fully O
"done". O
Make O
your O
work/life O
boundaries O
FIRM O
or O
you'll O
get O
all O
Sissyphus-y O
and O
noone O
fucks O
with O
that O
behavior. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
first O
year O
of O
teaching O
AND O
grad O
work O
is O
beyond O
exhausting. O
The O
bit O
about O
not O
going O
to O
the O
gym O
was O
esp. O
relatable. O
By O
the O
end O
of O
that O
first O
year O
I O
looked O
like O
a O
skeleton. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Remember O
the O
minimum O
passing O
grade O
for O
your O
classes O
and O
work O
to O
be O
a O
svelt O
but O
safe O
margin O
above O
that. O
You O
are O
learning O
so O
much, O
and O
practicing O
so O
many O
skills, O
that O
it O
is O
almost O
impossible O
for O
you O
to O
be O
a O
"""""good O
teacher""""" O
and O
meet O
ALL O
the O
expectations O
put O
on O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
stick O
with O
it O
and O
survive O
the O
year, O
all O
this O
will O
be O
a O
laughable O
memory O
when O
you O
get O
to O
your O
second O
year. O
Because O
then O
you're O
able O
to O
implement O
all O
the O
classroom O
strategies O
you've O
been O
working O
on, O
ON O
DAY O
1, O
BABY!! O
That's O
the O
good O
shit! O
It O
makes O
a O
world O
of O
difference, O
and O
I'm O
stoked O
for O
you O
to O
experience O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
cannot O
describe O
how O
much O
better O
your O
second O
year O
of O
teaching O
will O
be. O
So O
long O
as O
you O
focus O
on O
this O
year O
being O
your O
chance O
to O
learn, O
practice, O
and O
make O
mistakes! O
& O
don't O
you O
fucking O
LOOK O
at O
that O
work O
email O
before O
or O
after O
work O
hours, O
so O
help O
me O
Dewey. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
a O
first O
year O
and O
I O
am O
taking O
one O
tomorrow. O
I O
need O
it. O
You O
need O
it O
[SEP]
I O
was O
going O
to O
say O
the O
same O
thing; O
it's O
a O
mental O
health O
day O
to O
safeguard O
your O
mind. O
I O
take O
them O
as O
needed O
using O
my O
days. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
working O
to O
contract O
is O
the O
best O
advice O
in O
a O
teachers O
first O
year. O
In O
general, O
it O
takes O
a O
while O
to O
hit O
the O
learning O
curve O
and O
sometimes O
overwork O
is O
just O
part O
of O
the O
deal O
early O
on. O
Having O
said O
that, O
you O
need O
to O
take O
care O
of O
yourself. O
Stress O
and O
the O
accompanying O
depression/anxiety O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
cannot O
be O
slept O
off O
like O
a O
flu. O
You O
just O
have O
to O
move. O
Walk O
around O
the O
block O
a O
few O
times. O
But O
don’t O
just O
give O
in O
to O
gravity. O
Gravity O
is O
not O
your O
friend. O
Even O
moderate O
exercise O
is O
better O
than O
any O
medication. O
And O
I O
oughta O
know. O
[SEP]
On O
the O
subject O
of O
mental O
health O
days: O
it O
sometimes O
helps O
to O
get O
signed O
off O
for O
intermittent O
FMLA. O
You O
will O
wanna O
reach O
out O
to O
your O
Primary O
Care O
Provider O
or O
a O
therapist O
to O
help O
with O
this O
documentation. O
It O
ensures O
that O
you O
are O
protected O
from O
administrative O
action O
for O
the O
absences. O
[SEP]
Hey O
there. O
I O
decided O
to O
take O
a O
day O
next O
week! O
I B-Occupation
teach I-Occupation
4th I-Occupation
grade. I-Occupation
The O
only O
thing O
extra O
I O
have O
take O
on O
is O
tutoring O
once O
a O
week O
because O
I O
need O
the O
pay. O
[SEP]
Great O
advice! O
And O
yes, O
you O
can O
do O
anything O
for O
one O
year. O
And O
after O
finishing O
years O
1-2 O
of O
teaching, O
you O
can O
pretty O
much O
do O
anything. O
[SEP]
second O
this. O
[SEP]
Sure O
but O
in O
many O
states O
you're O
forced O
into O
it O
if O
you O
did O
not O
get O
an O
undergrad O
in O
education. O
[SEP]
Bro O
my O
student O
teaching O
period O
during O
my O
masters O
was O
insanely O
over O
booked. O
Now O
that O
school O
is O
over O
for O
me O
I O
can O
easily O
do O
everything O
I O
need O
to O
do O
within O
the O
confines O
of O
a O
"normal O
working O
period" O
[SEP]
Unfortunately, O
I O
need O
the O
pay O
raise O
that O
comes O
with O
a O
masters O
as O
soon O
as O
possible. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
a O
TFA O
requirement O
if O
OP O
is O
a O
corps O
member. O
[SEP]
I O
went O
off O
of O
those O
this O
past O
year, O
however O
I O
am O
definitely O
considering O
going O
back O
[SEP]
Second O
this! O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
[SEP]
So O
true O
about O
not O
grading O
everything!!! O
Even O
now, O
I’ll O
look O
at O
a O
pile O
of O
students’ O
papers, O
and O
fulfill O
the O
urge O
to O
just O
recycle O
them. O
I O
feel O
bad O
for O
about O
1 O
minute O
until O
I O
realize: O
nobody O
cares!! O
[SEP]
I O
really O
love O
this. O
All O
of O
this. O
[SEP]
I O
agree O
with O
Snoo’s O
advice. O
Life O
is O
too O
short O
[SEP]
Three O
colds O
and O
COVID O
so O
far O
this O
school O
year O
working O
as O
a O
full-time O
substitute O
in O
elementary O
school. O
Despite O
being O
vaccinated O
and O
boosted! O
Lots O
of O
teachers O
out O
today O
due O
to O
flu. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
have O
to O
do O
the O
real O
work O
of O
a O
teacher O
like O
grading O
papers, O
lesson O
prep, O
parent O
conferences, O
etc. O
but O
I O
still O
come O
home O
wiped O
out O
and O
am O
asleep O
by O
9 O
if O
not O
8 O
at O
night. O
[SEP]
Sweet! O
You O
must O
live O
in O
an O

with O
a O
good O

[SEP]
You’re O
* O
[SEP]
Thanks. O
I O
keep O
waiting O
for O
that O
stamina O
to O
kick O
in O
but O
I’m O
now O
learning O
it’s O
a O
much O
more O
long O
term O
thing! O
[SEP]
I'm O
working O
towards O
fulfilling O
my O
state's O
requirements O
to O
get O
an O
alt O
cert O
to O
teach O
HS O
English. O
I'm O
studying O
for O
the O
ELA O
Educators O
Assessment O
exam O
now, O
I'm O
also O
subbing O
currently O
and O
I'm O
always O
getting O
sick O
so O
I O
keep O
pushing O
the O
exam O
date O
back O
so O
I O
have O
plenty O
of O
studying O
time. O
Anyway, O
I O
hope O
to O
be O
in O
your O
shoes O
next O
year. O
Are O
you O
glad O
you O
chose O
this O
path, O
exhaustion O
notwithstanding? O
Are O
your O
fellow O
teachers O
supportive? O
Do O
you O
feel O
like O
your O
classroom O
management O
is O
getting O
better? O
I O
hope O
you O
don't O
mind O
my O
inquisition, O
it's O
just O
nice O
to O
see O
others O
others O
in O
Reddit O

what O
I O

Agreed. O
It's O
sounds O
counter-intuitive O
but O
when O
I O
exercise O
I O
have O
much O
more O
energy O
during O
the O
day O
than O
when O
I O
don't. O
Maybe O
OP O
could O
try O
10-15 O
min O

Thank O
you O
for O
this. O
I O
decided O
I’m O
taking O
a O
personal O
day O
next O
week. O
It’s O
confusing O
because O
I O
do O
not O
take O
work O
home, O
even O
though O
it O
sounds O
like O
I O
do. O
I O
leave O
at O
contract O
time O
every O
day. O
I O
think O
I O
am O
mentally O
taking O
stuff O
home O
and O
that’s O
the O
thing O
I O
don’t O
know O
how O
to O
stop O
[SEP]
I O
totally O
get O
what O
you’re O
saying. O
And O
I’ve O
thought O
about O
it O
a O
lot. O
But O
what O
makes O
a O
first O
year O
teacher O
different O
from O
any O
other O
teacher? O
How O
many O
first O
year O
teachers O
suffer O
so O
badly O
that O
they O
quit? O
If O
teacher O
programs O
aren’t O
preparing O
teachers O
to O
teach, O
something O
has O
to O
change. O
It O
shouldn’t O
just O
have O
to O
be, O
welp O
everyone O
had O
a O
really O
shitty O
first O
year, O
good O
luck O
and O
do O
your O
best. O
What O
would O
it O
look O
like O
if O
first O
year O
teachers O
worked O
to O
contract O
like O
anyone O
else? O
My O
teacher O
mentor O
when O
I O
was O
in O
grad O
school, O
stayed O
after O
school O
until O
at O
least O
6pm O
every O
day. O
I O
had O
a O
principal O
who O
said O
teachers O
should O
stay O
until O
the O
work O
is O
finished. O
This O
mentality O
needs O
to O
change. O
My O
argument O
is O
that O
teachers O
would O
learn O
time O
management O
even O
sooner O
and O
they O
letting O
go O
of O
things O
is O
ok O
if O
they O
left O
on O
time. O
[SEP]
Yea O
or O
if O
you O
want O
a O
livable O
wage O
[SEP]
It O
is O
not O
a O
TFA O
requirement. O
Perhaps O
some O
states O
require O
it. O
[SEP]
For O
those O
who O
downvoted O
me, O
I O
can’t O
leave O
a O
your/ O
you’re O
mistake O
because O
I O
just O
claimed O
to O
be O
a O
teacher. O
That’s O
a O
baaaad O
mistake O
to O
make O
for O
a O
teacher, O
In O
my O
honest O
opinion. O
Right O
up O
there O
with O
not O
knowing O
how O
to O
use O
they’re, O
their, O
and O
there; O
or O
to, O
too, O
and O
two. O
I O
figure O
if O
I’m O
responsible O
for O
educating O
the O
next O
generation, O
I’d O
better O
hold O
myself O
to O
the O
appropriate O
standard O
I’d O
hold O
them O
to. O

I O
am O
thankful O
every O
day. O
I O
have O
only O
known O
food O
service O
and O
hospitality O
for O
my O
adult O
life. O
I O
used O
to O
sit O
there O
at O
various O
restaurants, O
coffee O
shops, O
hotels, O
etc O
staring O
out O
the O
window O
for O
hours O
on O
slow O
days O
miserable O
out O
of O
my O
mind, O
dreaming O
of O
being O
anywhere O
else. O
I O
would O
do O
it O
all O
again. O
I O
have O
gotten O
better O
at O
many O
things, O
and O
other O
things O
are O
a O
work O
in O
progress. O
My O
biggest O
advice O
is O
be O
a O
fair, O
kind, O
funny O
hardass O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
can O
in O
the O
year. O
Drink O
water. O
Eat O
well. O
Don't O
take O
things O
personally. O
Know O
that O
you O
will O
lose O
sleep, O
lose O
weight, O
and O
feel O
overwhelmed, O
and O
be O
prepared O
for O
that. O
My O
administration O
and O
colleagues O
are O
supportive O
enough O
and O
my O
coach O
is O
AMAZING O
but O
doesn't O
know O
my O
content O
area. O
Lesson O
planning O
and O
grading O
are O
huge O
learning O
curves O
but O
admin O
will O
look O
more O
at O
classroom O
management O
in O
my O
experience. O
Drink O
whatever O
Kool O
aid O
your O
school O
is O
pushing, O
for O
us O
it's O
PBIS O
and O
relevancy O
statements, O
but O
be O
realistic O
about O
your O
abilities. O
And O
above O
all O
remember O
that O
you O
have O
to O
teach O
the O
kids O
you O
have. O
No O
amount O
of O
complaining O
will O
transform O
your O
students O
into O
what O
you O
expect O
of O
them. O
They O
are O
who O
they O
are. O
You O
can't O
teach O
students O
who O
aren't O
there--so O
don't O
try. O
Best O
of O
luck O
to O
you O
<3 O
[SEP]
Just O
because O
you O
aren't O
at O
work O
or O
doing O
work O
tasks O
doesn't O
mean O
that O
your O
body O
is O
at O
rest. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Make O
a O
list O
of O
things O
that O
make O

truly O
rejuvenated O
and O
require O
little O
energy O
and O
try O
to O
do O
at O
least O
one O
or O
two O
of O
those O
things O
each O
night. O
Then, O
on O
your O
days O
off, O
seriously O
dive O
into O
those O
fulfilling O
passions. O
It O
can O
be O
easy O
to O
fall O
into O
a O
spiral O
of O
low-input O
dopamine O
seeking O
tasks O
(like O

lmao) O
but O
those O
rarely O
allow O
our O

rejuvenation. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Another O
thing O
that O
took O
time O
for O
me O
to O
master: O
Feel O
justified O
in O
saying O
no O
to O
as O
many O
invitations/obligations O
as O
you O
need O
to O
in O
order O
to O

mentally/emotionally. O

Meditation O
and O
yoga O
helped O
tremendously. O
I O
never O
was O
too O
rigorous, O
but O
it O
focused O
me O
to O
be O
present O
in O
the O
moment, O
which O
helped O
me O
recognize O
the O
work O
stuff O
I O
was O
bringing O
home. O
[SEP]
I O
did O
a O
post O
on O
another O
sub O
about O
“educational O
martyrs“. O
Many O
teachers O
had O
something O
to O
say O
about O
this. O
I O
got O
close O
to O
1000 O
comments, O
most O
like O
me, O
had O
very O
little O
patience O
for O
the O
type O
of O
teacher O
who O
puts O
in O
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
without O
any O
compensation. O
The O
pay O
they O
get O
is O
the O
right O
to O
humble O
brag. O
It’s O
not O
just O
that O
they O
work O
hard O
and O
long O
hours. O
It’s O
they O
work O
harder O
and O
longer O
than O
YOU O
do. O
And O
of O
course, O
they O
have O
to O
let O
you O
know O
or O
else O
all O
that O
work O
they O
did O
was O
in O
vain. O
Because O
I O
don’t O
believe O
for O
a O
minute O
that O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
for O
all O
“the O
kids“. O
We’re O
all O
fucking O
doing O
it O
for O
the O
kids! O
These O
people O
undermined O
their O
peers O
at O
contract O
negotiations. O
The O
administration O
puts O
them O
on O
a O
pedestal O
wrap O
some O
shiny O
wrapping O
paper O
and O
put O
some O
ribbon O
on O
therefore O
head. O
See! O
If O
these O
people O
can O
work O
all O
these O
extra O
hours O
without O
pay O
that O
you O
should O
be O
able O
to O
do O
it O
too. O
Aren’t O
you O
in O
it O
for O
the O
kids? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Having O
said O
all O
that, O
we O
need O
to O
be O
supportive O
of O
this O
particular O
teacher O
who O
is O
reaching O
out O
for O
help. O
Now. O
She O
can’t O
wait O
for O
this O
flawed O
model O
of O
teacher O
preparation O
to O
be O
rearranged. O

AITA O
for O
uninviting O
my O
newly O
homophobic O
friend O
from O
my O
wedding? O
[SEP]
I O
(25f) B-Age_Gender
am B-Relationship_Status
getting I-Relationship_Status
married I-Relationship_Status
to I-Relationship_Status
my I-Relationship_Status
fiance I-Relationship_Status
next B-Time
month. I-Time
The O
wedding O
planning O
has O
been O
a O
smooth O
process O
and O
we've O
had O
no O
issues O
until O
late O
last O
week. O
I O
invited O
a O
friend O
(N) O
from O
school, O
we've O
been O
friends O
for O
12 O
years O
and O
have O
drifted O
apart O
due O
to O
life. O
She O
has O
always O
been O
quiet O
and O
not O
one O
to O
open O
up O
much, O
but O
Ive O
witnessed O
her O
unwavering O
support O
for O
the O
lgbtq+ O
community O
numerous O
times. O
N O
got O
into O
a O
relationship O
about O
4 O
years O
ago O
and O
had O
a O
baby O
with O
the O
man O
(L) O
last O
year. O
I O
met O
L O
at O
her O
baby O
shower O
and O
he O
seemed O
decent O
until O
I O
noticed O
some O
things, O
such O
as O
complaining O
that O
his O
son O
will O
not O
be O
using O
a O
pink O
colored O
teething O
ring O
and O
that O
the O
gender O
neutral O
clothing O
looked O
too O
'girly', O
and O
that O
he O
answered O
quite O
a O
few O
questions O
for O
N, O
stared O
her O
down O
and O
would O
white O
knuckle O
her O
knee O
every O
time O
she O
tried O
to O
give O
a O
different O
answer. O
I O
wholeheartedly O
believe O
she O
is O
being O
abused, O
because O
she O
is O
so O
quiet O
and O
doesnt O
stand O
up O
for O
herself. O

The O
main O
issue O
is O
that O
my O
gay O
sister O
and O
a O
few O
of O
my O
gay/bisexual O
cousins O
and O
friends O
are O
in O
my O
wedding O
party, O
and O
L O
does O
not O
like O
that. O
They O
(mostly O
L) O
called O
me O
last O
week O
to O
let O
me O
know O
how O
disrespectful O
it O
was O
to O
god O
that O
Ive O
allowed O
"the O
homos O
to O
infiltrate O
a O
sacred O
god O
ordained O
union". O
I O
laughed O
and O
hung O
up. O
N O
called O
me O
some O
hours O
later O
when O
she O
was O
alone O
and O
apologized O
for O
L's O
behavior, O
but O
told O
me O
she O
cant O
do O
anything O
about O
that. O
I O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
truly O
felt O
the O
way O
about O
my O
wedding O
that O
L O
claimed O
she O
did, O
and O
she O
sat O
quiet O
for O
about O
a O
minute O
before O
she O
laughed O
a O
bit O
and O
let O
an O
I O
dont O
know O
slip O
out O
of O
her O
mouth. O
I O
let O
her O
know O
that O
because O
of O
recent O
events O
regarding O
the O
lgbtq O
community O
here O
in O
Colorado O
I O
will O
be O
protecting O
my O
family O
and O
friends O
by O
not O
taking O
any O
chances, O
and O
therefore O
she O
and O
L O
are O
uninvited O
from O
my O
wedding. O
If O
anyone O
is O
wondering O
how O
they O
found O
out O
about O
my O
family O
being O
lgbtq+, O
me O
and O
fiance O
started O
a O
large O
group O
chat O
of O
friends/family O
to O
get O
to O
know O
eachother, O
and O
a O
few O
relatives O
have O
shocked O
me O
by O
their O
vitriolic O
contempt O
for O
the O
lgbt O
community, O
so O
they O
have O
been O
uninvited O
as O
well O
for O
safety, O
and O
fiance O
agrees. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
few O
mutual O
friends O
are O
calling O
me O
an O
asshole O
and O
unreasonable O
for O
what O
Ive O
done, O
because O
we've O
all O
seen O
N's O
support O

the O

firsthand, O
and O
we've O
all O
seen O
the O
manipulative O

from O
L O
and O
know O
she O
is O
possibly O
being O
abused. O
Unfortunately O
I O
dont O

I O

anything O
further O

Im O

break O

cutting O
them O
both O
out O

the O

shitty O
behavior O

that O
then O
over O

creates O
an O
even O

hurdle O
for O
the O
victim O

get O
over, O

I O
(25f) B-Age_Gender
am O
getting O
married O
to O
my O
fiance O
next O
month. O
The O
wedding O
planning O
has O
been O
a O
smooth O
process O
and O
we've O
had O
no O
issues O
until O
late O
last O
week. O
I O
invited O
a O
friend O
(N) O
from O
school, O
we've O
been O
friends O
for O
12 O
years O
and O
have O
drifted O
apart O
due O
to O
life. O
She O
has O
always O
been O
quiet O
and O
not O
one O
to O
open O
up O
much, O
but O
Ive O
witnessed O
her O
unwavering O
support O
for O
the O
lgbtq+ O
community O
numerous O
times. O
N O
got O
into O
a O
relationship O
about O
4 O
years O
ago O
and O
had O
a O
baby O
with O
the O
man O
(L) O
last O
year. O
I O
met O
L O
at O
her O
baby O
shower O
and O
he O
seemed O
decent O
until O
I O
noticed O
some O
things, O
such O
as O
complaining O
that O
his O
son O
will O
not O
be O
using O
a O
pink O
colored O
teething O
ring O
and O
that O
the O
gender O
neutral O
clothing O
looked O
too O
'girly', O
and O
that O
he O
answered O
quite O
a O
few O
questions O
for O
N, O
stared O
her O
down O
and O
would O
white O
knuckle O
her O
knee O
every O
time O
she O
tried O
to O
give O
a O
different O
answer. O
I O
wholeheartedly O
believe O
she O
is O
being O
abused, O
because O
she O
is O
so O
quiet O
and O
doesnt O
stand O
up O
for O
herself. O
[SEP]

The O
main O
issue O
is O
that O
my O
gay O
sister O
and O
a O
few O
of O
my O
gay/bisexual O
cousins O
and O
friends O
are O
in O
my O
wedding O
party, O
and O
L O
does O
not O
like O
that. O
They O
(mostly O
L) O
called O
me O
last O
week O
to O
let O
me O
know O
how O
disrespectful O
it O
was O
to O
god O
that O
Ive O
allowed O
"the O
homos O
to O
infiltrate O
a O
sacred O
god O
ordained O
union". O
I O
laughed O
and O
hung O
up. O
N O
called O
me O
some O
hours O
later O
when O
she O
was O
alone O
and O
apologized O
for O
L's O
behavior, O
but O
told O
me O
she O
cant O
do O
anything O
about O
that. O
I O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
truly O
felt O
the O
way O
about O
my O
wedding O
that O
L O
claimed O
she O
did, O
and O
she O
sat O
quiet O
for O
about O
a O
minute O
before O
she O
laughed O
a O
bit O
and O
let O
an O
I O
dont O
know O
slip O
out O
of O
her O
mouth. O
I O
let O
her O
know O
that O
because O
of O
recent O
events O
regarding O
the O
lgbtq O
community O
here O
in O
Colorado O
I O
will O
be O
protecting O
my O
family O
and O
friends O
by O
not O
taking O
any O
chances, O
and O
therefore O
she O
and O
L O
are O
uninvited O
from O
my O
wedding. O
If O
anyone O
is O
wondering O
how O
they O
found O
out O
about O
my O
family O
being O
lgbtq+, O
me O
and O
fiance O
started O
a O
large O
group O
chat O
of O
friends/family O
to O
get O
to O
know O
eachother, O
and O
a O
few O
relatives O
have O
shocked O
me O
by O
their O
vitriolic O
contempt O
for O
the O
lgbt O
community, O
so O
they O
have O
been O
uninvited O
as O
well O
for O
safety, O
and O
fiance O
agrees. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
few O
mutual O
friends O
are O
calling O
me O
an O
asshole O
and O
unreasonable O
for O
what O
Ive O
done, O
because O
we've O
all O
seen O
N's O
support O
for O
the O
community O
firsthand, O
and O
we've O
all O
seen O
the O
manipulative O
behavior O
from O
L O
and O
know O
she O
is O
possibly O
being O
abused. O
Unfortunately O
I O
dont O
feel O
I O
can O
do O
anything O
further O
and O
Im O
going O
to O
do O
what O
I O
feel O
is O
right O
to O
protect O
my O
family. O

[SEP]

[SEP]
[SEP]
Yes, O
N O

being O
abused, O

until O
she O
does O
something O
it O
won't O

She O

never O

Always O

There’s O

However, O
if O

know O
that O
there O
are O
resources O
out O
there O
to O
help O
her O
out O
of O
an O
abusive O

I O
would O
do O
that O

It O
sounds O

coached O

saying O
what O
her O

wants O

hear O

I O
worry O
for O

your O

spot O
on, O

budge O

Unless O

using O
the O

very O
serious O

your O
distant O

needs O
someone O
close O

help. O
You O
don't O
want O
to O
look O
back O

think O
"I O
always O
thought O

might O
hurt O
her". O

chose O
a O

invite O

While O

the O

rather O
misleading. O
the O

paints O

homophobic, O

you O
admit O
it O
sounds O
more O
like O
she’s O
possibly O
being O
abused O

suppressed O
by O
her O
husband. O
You O
might O
want O
to O
edit O
that O
if O
you O
can, O
because O
it O
comes O
across O
a O
bit O

you’re O
judging O
her O

be O
homophobic O

NTA! O

I O
think O
YTA. O
You O
seen O
your O
friend O
being O
abused O
and O
didnt O
do O
anything O
about O
it O
and O
you O
saw O
her O
support O
the O
lgbt O
community, O
so O
you O
know O
she O
does. O
If O
he O
is O
manipulating O
her O
into O
being O
homophobic O
then O
youre O
TA O
again O
for O
not O
just O
inviting O
her O
and O
giving O
her O
a O
chance O
to O
explain O
herself O
without O
him O
breathing O
down O
her O
neck. O
[SEP]
Also O
if O
L O

your O
relatives O
didnt O
threaten O
your O
family O
and O
just O
dont O
agree O
with O
the O
gay O
lifestyle, O
they O
should O
be O
given O
some O

Lots O

dont O
agree O
with O
being O

they O
shouldnt O
be O

for O
it O

YTA. O
Said O
my O
opinion, O
if O

me O
that's O
your O
conscience O
not O
mine. O
[SEP]
YTA O
not O
for O
uninviting O
people O
from O
your O
wedding O
for O
homophobic O
views. O
YTA O
for O
not O
offering O
N O
the O
support O
she O
needs. O
You O
say O
you O
have O
been O
friends O
for O
12 O
years O
but O
you O
cut O
her O
off O
from O
part O
of O
her O

network, O
you O
may O
be O
all O
she O
has. O
Call O
her, O
get O
her O

Email O
her O
info O
on O
battered O

shelters O
if O
you O
think O
physical O
abuse. O
Offer O
her O
a O

she O

out. O
Dont O
leave O
your O
friend O
in O
a O
position O
where O
all O
she O
has O
is O
an O

[SEP]
So, O
you O
truly O
believe O
that O
inviting O
someone O
who O
is O
anti-gay O
to O
your O
wedding O
would O
create O
a O
safety O
issue O
for O
others? O
Are O
you O
worried O
for O
their O
actual O
physical O
safety, O
which O
seems O
a O
bit O
far-fetched, O
or O
are O
you O
worried O
that O
this O
guy O
might O
say O
something O
to O
hurt O
someone's O
feelings? O
Depending O
on O
how O
much O
you O
value O
your O
friendship O
with O
N, O
you O
need O
to O
carefully O
evaluate O
whether O
you O
have O
a O
legitimate O
safety O
concern O
or O
are O
you O
just O
virtue O
signaling O
on O
behalf O
of O
your O
gay O
friends/family? O
Also O
consider O
how O
important O
it O
is O
(or O
isn't) O
to O
your O
friend O
to O
attend. O
You O
say O
you've O
drifted O
apart; O
maybe O
she O
really O
doesn't O
care O
about O
attending O
your O
wedding O
and O
viewed O
your O
invitation O
as O
a O
solicitation O
for O
a O
wedding O
present... O
(The O
whole O
thing O
about O
her O
narcissistic O
husband O
is O
a O
wholly O
separate O
issue. O
But, O
would O
you O
disinvite O
your O
friend O
if O
her O
husband O
were O
just O
a O
controlling O
narcissist O
without O
the O
anti-gay O
baggage? O
) O
Just O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
to O
consider. O
[SEP]
I O
came O
to O
say O
this!!!!! O
NTA. O
The O
climate O
is O
crazy O
right O
now O
and O
you O
can't O
chance O
an O
abuser O
doing O
something O
crazy. O
[SEP]
N O
may O
have O
done O
a O
"lot" O
in O
the O
past O
for O
the O
community, O
but O
she's O
absolutely O
showing O
that O
her O
support O
is O
conditional O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
her O
own O
personal O
comfort. O
And, O
guess O
what, O
that's O
absolutely O
not O
good O
enough, O
especially O
right O
now, O
to O
guarantee O
the O
well-being O
and O
safety O
of O
anyone O
LGBT O
at O
the O
wedding. O
If O
she's O
being O
abused, O
the O
safest O
course O
of O
action O
would O
not O
be O
centered O
around O
inviting O
N O
to O
the O
wedding O
and/or O
keeping O
her O
involved O
with O
the O
event, O
but O
for O
OP O
to O
say O
that O
she O
would O
support O
N O
if O
and O
when O
she O
needs O
help O
leaving. O
[SEP]
This. O
Help O
your O
friend O
get O
out O
of O
there O
if O
you O
can, O
but O
keep O
yourself O
and O
your O
loved O
ones O
safe. O
NTA O
[SEP]
All O
of O
this, O
but O
id O
also O
extend O
an O
olive O
branch O
to O
the O
friend O
to O
let O
her O
know O
op O
will O
help O
her O
if O
she O
needs O
to O
leave, O
that O
is O
textbook O
signs O
of O
abuse O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
he's O
so O
blatant O
about O
it O
in O
front O
of O
people O
means O
it O
is O
escalating O
[SEP]
THIS! O
SO O
SO O
SO O
MUCH O
THIS! O
[SEP]
exactly, O
people O
expect O
us O
to O
continue O
to O
let O
ourselves O
be O
killed O
and O
maimed O
for O
their O
delicate O
heterosexual O
sensibilities O
pero O
I'm O
not O
taking O
any O
chances! O
It O
really O
sucks O
that O
your O
friend O
is O
being O
abused O
but O
it's O
up O
to O
the O
abused O
person O
to O
ask O
for O
help. O
right O
now O
she's O
just O
helping O
him O
be O
a O
homophobe O
and O
spread O
hateful O
rhetoric, O
enabling O
him O
by O
saying O
it's O
okay O
and O
continuing O
to O
not O
only O
date O
said O
homophobe O
but O
saying O
"I O
don't O
know" O
to O
whether O
or O
not O
she O
agrees O
with O
him. O
I O
would O
tell O
her O
"I O
don't O
know" O
if O
I O
can O
be O
friends O
with O
such O
a O
violent O
homophobe O
[SEP]
This O
should O
be O
so O
much O
higher O
up. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
OP O
can O
do O
both O
by O
telling O
N O
that O
you O
love O
her O
and O
you’re O
here O
if O
she O
needs O
you. O
But O
that O
you O
can’t O
have O
her, O
or O
anyone O
who O
can’t O
provide O
wholehearted O
support O
to O
the O
LGBTQ O
community O
at O
your O
wedding O
[SEP]
Yes! O
The O
absolute O
best O
thing O
OP O
can O
do O
right O
now O
is O
leave O
the O
door O
open O
to O
her O
if O
or O
when O
she O
needs O
it, O
but O
not O
to O
put O
the O
people O
at O
the O
wedding O
in O
danger. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
lot O
of O
people O
stay O
in O
abusive O
relationships O
because O
they O
feel O
isolated O
and O
trapped. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Do O
what O
you O
need O
to O
do O
now O
to O
keep O
people O
safe, O
but O
also O
keep O
one O
foot O
in O
the O
door O
incase O
she O
also O
needs O
a O
safe O
place O
in O
the O
future. O
[SEP]
Well O
said! O
[SEP]
I O
believe O
OP O
used O
L O
for O
the O
male O
partner; O
her O
friend O
is O
N. O
[SEP]
Hopefully O
they O
can O
find O
someway O
to O
support O
N O
and O
talk O
with O
her O
about O
the O
abuse O
she O
is O
having O
done O
to O
her. O
Let O
her O
knowvwhat O
options O
she O
has O
if O
she O
needs O
to O
escape, O
who O
to O
call O
and O
where O
she O
can O
stay. O
[SEP]
Yes, O
N O
is O
showing O
signs O
she's O
coping O
with O
the O
abuse O
by O
identifying O
with O
her O
perpetrator. O
Tragic, O
but O
not O
OP's O
responsibility. O
[SEP]
I O
came O
here O
to O
say O
exactly O
that! O
What O
is O
to O
gain O
by O
inviting O
her O
to O
the O
wedding? O
She O
most O
likely O
would O
be O
uneasy O
about O
her O
SO O
doing O
something O
stupid O
and O
not O
fully O
enjoy O
the O
wedding O
anyway. O
[SEP]
How O
is O
it O
jot O
helping? O
Not O
having O
a O
person O
like O
L O
at O
the O
wedding O
is O
100% O
the O
right O
thing. O
Also O
I O
guarantee O
that O
N O
will O
not O
be O
sloud O
to O
attend O
without O
L. O
[SEP]
This O
doesn't O
seem O
like O
rose O
colored O
glasses, O
N O
seems O
to O
be O
genuinely O
afraid O
of O
standing O
up O
for O
herself. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
wedding O
is O
not O
the O
day O
to O
do O
it, O
I O
understand O
that, O
but O
OP O
may O
need O
to O
perform O
a O
legitimate O
rescue O
of O
N O
before O
things O
start O
to O
get O
physical. O
There O
isn't O
going O
to O
be O
that O
magical O
day O
where O
she O
wakes O
up O
and O
the O
truth O
hits O
her O
and O
she O
leaves O
on O
her O
own. O
Women O
in O
her O
position O
are O
in O
very O
real O
danger O
and O
need O
help O
getting O
to O
safety. O
[SEP]
This. O
[SEP]
I O
would O
add O
that O
you O
could O
tell O
her O
specifically O
what O
support O
you O
could O
offer O
if O
she O
ever O
felt O
the O
need O
to O
leave O
her O
husband. O
Could O
you O
give O
her O
a O
ride O
to O
a O
shelter, O
offer O
her O
a O
room O
in O
your O
house, O
or O
help O
her O
get O
a O
bus O
ticket O
to O
a O
relative? O
Knowing O
what O
her O
options O
would O
be O
if O
she O
needed O
to O
leave O
can O
be O
the O
thing O
that O
helps O
her O
get O
free O
ultimately. O
Ideally O
she O
would O
make O
a O
safety O
plan O
for O
what O
to O
do O
if O
her O
situation O
became O
untenable. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
it's O
more O
likely O
L O
was O
listening O
to O
the O
conversation, O
probably O
standing O
right O
next O
to O
her O
or O
on O
the O
line O
in O
another O
room. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Even O
then, O
OP's O
absolutely O
NTA. O
[SEP]
This O
woman O
clearly O
sounds O
like O
she O
is O
in O
a O
Domestic O
Violence O
relationship, O
and O
leaving O
DV O
abusers O
is O
most O
often O
not O
easy O
at O
all O
- O
not O
the O
least O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
often O
the O
abuse O
significantly O
escalated O
when O
the O
victim O
is O
leaving O
and O
the O
abuser O
fears O
that O
he O
is O
losing O
control; O
also O
btw O
the O
time O
when O
a O
majority O
of O
lethal O
incidences O
occur. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Of O
course O
she O
should O
leave O
(safely), O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
can O
for O
many O
reasons; O
but O
quite O
frankly O
the O
guy O
being O
a O
homophobe O
probably O
*right O
now* O
is O
not O
exactly O
on O
the O
top O
of O
her O
immediate O
concerns O
(that O
might O
be O
more: O
“I O
hope O
he O
does O
not O
hurt O
me O
or O
kill O
me O
today”). O
[SEP]
And O
if O
anyone O
responds O
saying O
she's O
in O
an O
abusive O
relationship, O
point O
out O
it O
takes O
people O
in O
an O
abusive O
relationship O
7 O
times O
to O
successfully O
leave. O
And O
they O
only O
leave O
when O
they O
want O
to. O
N O
doesn't O
want O
to O
leave O
yet O
and O
you O
don't O
know O
how O
long O
it's O
going O
to O
be O
until O
she O
does, O
or O
if O
she O
will O
ever O
want O
to O
leave. O
So O
your O
wedding O
isn't O
the O
time O
or O
place O
to O
force O
these O
difficult O
conversations O
& O
somewhere O
deep O
down, O
N O
knows O
that O
before O
L O
she O
would O
have O
made O
the O
same O
choice O
you're O
making O
now. O
[SEP]
She O
did O
not O
choose O
to O
be O
abused, O
and O
it O
can O
be O
extrememly O
difficult O
to O
leave O
abusive O
situations, O
especially O
when O
a O
child O
is O
involved. O
She O
may O
actually O
still O
support O
the O
community O
but O
she O
may O
be O
too O
terrified O
to O
let O
me O
know O
because O
she O
is O
being O
held O
under O
her O
boyfriends O
thumb. O
If O
she O
had O
told O
me O
she O
was O
still O
supportive, O
what O
if O
he O
was O
listening O
from O
the O
other O
room O
and O
decided O
to O
hurt O
her O
after O
she O
hung O
up? O
I O
want O
her O
to O
get O
help O
and O
get O
out O
but O
abusers O
are O
powerful O
and O
its O
not O
my O
place O
to O
meddle, O
though O
Im O
currently O
doing O
everything O
I O
can O
to O
set O
her O
up O
with O
a O
support O
system O
and O
resources. O
[SEP]
She O
is O
still O
my O
friend. O
Its O
not O
her O
fault O
that O
hes O
treating O
her O
this O
way O
and O
its O
difficult O
to O
leave O
abusive O
situations, O
especially O
when O
theres O
a O
child O
involved. O
She O
didnt O
choose O
that. O
She O
may O
not O
feel O
the O
way O
about O
the O
lgbtq O
community O
that O
her O
boyfriend O
does O
but O
unfortunately O
I O
cant O
take O
that O
risk. O
[SEP]
That’s O
not O
how O
abusive O

this O
work. O
You O
don’t O
choose O
it O

poor O

You O

doing O
a O

Nowhere O
in O
my O
post O
did O
I O
mention O
not O
supporting O
my O
friend. O
I O
want O
her O
to O
get O
help O
and O
get O
out O
but O
abusers O
are O
powerful O
and O
its O
not O
my O
place O
to O
meddle O
in O
anyones O
relationship, O
though O
Im O
currently O
doing O
everything O
I O
can O
to O
set O
her O
up O
with O
a O
support O
system O
and O
resources O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible. O
I O
have O
not O
cut O
her O
off, O
I O
simply O
uninvited O
her O
from O
an O
event O
where O
my O
lgbtq O
family O
and O
friends O
will O
be O
vulnerable. O
I O
made O
a O

protect O
my O

Yes, O
I O
am O
without O

100% O
concerned O
for O
their O
physical O
safety O
as O
well O
as O
their O
mental O
well O

so O
I O
am O
taking O
precautions. O
There O
are O
insane O
people O
everywhere, O
and O
literally O
anyone O
could O
snap O
at O
any O

People O
in O
the O
community O
are O
being O
unalived O
solely O
for O
whom O
they O
choose O
to O
love O
or O
how O
they O
identify. O
Im O
developing O
a O
slight O
agoraphobia O
over O
the O
last O
few O
years O
simply O
because O
of O
this O
and O
its O
taking O
a O
lot O
out O
of O
me O
mentally O
to O
have O
over O
100 O
people, O
all O
with O
different O
mental O

The O
state O
of O
my O
friendship O
with O
N O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
my O
decision. O
If O
we O
hadnt O
talked O
in O
10 O
years, O
or O
if O
we O
were O
as O
close O
knit O
as O
two O
people O
possibly O
could O
be, O
I O
would O
still O
be O
making O
the O
decision O
to O
keep O
my O
loved O
ones O
safe. O
I O
never O
stated O
that O
her O
boyfriend O
was O
a O
narcissist, O
I O
just O
know O
that O
what O
I O
witnessed O
was O
abusive O
behavior, O
those O
two O
things O
are O
not O
exclusive. O
3. O
Ive O
asked O
guests O
not O
to O
bring O
gifts O
as O
me O
and O
my O
fiance O
have O
everything O
we O
need O
and O
want, O
because O
this O
is O
a O
celebration O
of O
love O
that O
we O
want O
to O
share O
with O
no O
obligations. O
[SEP]
Even O
if O
she O
is O
being O
abused, O
she O
called O
OP O
back O
when O
L O
wasn't O
around O
to O
apologize O
for O
his O
behavior. O
So O
when O
she O
laughed O
and O
said O
she O
didn't O
know O
if O
she O
agreed O
with O
what O
he O
said, O
she O
wasn't O
under O
any O
kind O
of O
threat O
which O
might O
have O
prevented O
her O
from O
speaking O
freely. O
(Presumably, O
if O
L O
had, O
say, O
cameras O
that O
also O
pick O
up O
audio, O
or O
bugged O
her O
phone, O
or O
something, O
she O
wouldn't O
have O
called O
OP O
to O
apologize O
for O
L O
in O
the O
first O
place, O
so O
she O
at O
least O
thought O
she O
could O
speak O
freely.) O
[SEP]
This O
is O
very O
important. O
He O
is O
trying O
to O
isolate O
her O
so O
she O
will O
have O
no O
escape O
route. O
Make O
it O
very O
clear O
that O
while O
she O
is O
not O
invited O
to O
the O
wedding, O
you O
will O
help O
her O
in O
find O
a O
safe O
place O
to O
stay O
if O
she O
ever O

leave O
him. O

[SEP]
[SEP]
It’s O
also O
not O
easy O
for O
abused O
people O
to O
ask O
for O

Saying O
that O
the O
abused O
person O
is O
enabling O
a O
homophobe O
by O
not O
standing O
up O

him O
is O

It O
is O
very O
common O
for O
people O
to O
say O
“I O
don’t O
know” O
when O
they’re O
stuck O
in O
a O
situation O
like O
this. O
It O
usually O
happens O
when O
there’s O
an O
internal O
conflict O
between O
her O
belief O
of O
supporting O
lgbt O
people O
like O
she O
did O
in O
the O
past, O
and O
her O
current O
conditioning O
by O
the O

to O
reject O
lgbt O
people. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
not O
saying O
that O
OP O
should O
invite O
the O
friend O
and O
the O
husband, O
because O
Op O
definitely O
shouldn’t. O
But O
what O
I’m O
saying O
is O
that O
the O
friend O
has O
supported O
lgbt O
people O
in O
the O
past. O
Now O
that O
she’s O
in O
this O
situation, O
it’s O
more O
empathetic O
to O
help O
her O
out O
of O
an O
abusive O
relationship O
(separate O
from O
the O
wedding O
of O
course), O
instead O
of O
condemning O
her O
for O
not O
being O
able O
to O
go O
against O
her O

[SEP]
I O
feel O
that O
is O
what O
is O
happening O
too. O
My B-Family
aunt I-Family
has I-Family
been I-Family
in I-Family
an I-Family
emotionally I-Family
abusive I-Family
relationship I-Family
for I-Family
the I-Family
last I-Family
16 I-Family
years. I-Family
Over O
the O
years O
she O
began O
to O
repeat O
his O
points O
of O
view O
even O
when O
he O
is O
not O
around. O
It's O
been O
drilled O
into O
her O
head O
so O
many O
times O
I O
think O
she O
has O
come O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
what O
she O
truely O
believes. O
OP O
could O
try O
and O
keep O
the O
invitation O
for O
N O
and O
only O
disinvite O
L, O
but O
N O
wouldn't O
show O
up O
without O
him. O
In O
this O
environment O
you O
can't O
allow O
the O
chance O
that O
L O
will O
show O
up O
with O
N, O
so O
they O
both O
will O
have O
to O
be O
cut O
from O
the O
guest O
list. O
If O
I O
was O
OP, O
I O
would O
still O
make O
sure O
that O
N O
knows O
that O
this O
is O
really O
about O
L O
and O
that O
OP O
will O
help O
her O
should O
she O
ever O
want O
to O
leave O
L. O

You O

N O
probably O
is O
genuinely O
scared O
of O
him. O
But O
OP O
can’t O
save O
her O
unless O
she O
wants O
to O
be O
saved O
and O
that’s O
the O
sad O
reality O
of O
it. O
If O
she O
tries O
to O
make O
N O
leave O
now, O
it’s O
highly O
likely O
that O
N O
will O
end O
up O
going O
back O
to O
him O
anyway. O

‘Oh O

with O

about O
all O

up O

several O

I O

it’ll O
be O
hard O
for O
her O
now, O
especially O
with O

I O
think O
if O
OP O
wants O

a O
good O

she’ll O
always O
offer O
to O
be O
there O
for O

I’ve O
been O
in O
N’s O
situation. O
Twice. O
And O
it O
got O
worse O
and O
worse O
and O
worse O
and O
I O
didn’t O
leave O
no O
matter O
what. O
My O
second O
ex O
even O
threatened O
to O
stab O
me O
in O
the O
stomach O
with O
a O
knife O
while O
our O
son O
was O
laying O
in O
his O
Moses O
basket O
across O
the O
room. O
And O
I O
still O
didn’t O
leave O
him O
then. O
Because O
he O
had O
such O
a O
hold O
on O
me. O
He O
came O
back O
every O
time O
with O
apologies O
and O
flowers O
and O
loads O
of O
gifts O
and O
would O
get O
on O
his O
knees O
and O
beg O
for O
forgiveness, O
and O
I O
took O
him O
back O
every O
time O
because O
he O
made O
me O
believe O
that O
I O
was O
a O
horrible O
human O
being O
and O
that O
he O
was O
the O
only O
person O
who O
would O
ever O
want O
to O
be O
with O
me O
and O
I O
believed O
him. O
With O
everything O
he O
did O
to O
me, O
it O
took O
him O
kicking O
the O
crap O
out O
of O
me O
whilst O
holding O
our O
son O
for O
me O
to O
leave. O
I O
don’t O
know O
if O
you’ve O
ever O
been O
the O
situation, O
and O
I O
pray O
that O
you O
never O
have O
been, O
but O
it’s O
different O
for O
everyone O
and O
it’s O
easier O
to O
make O
comments O
looking O
in O
on O
the O
situation. O
I O
can O
make O
judgements O
about O
N O
and O
L’s O
relationship O
based O
off O
of O
what O
OP O
wrote, O
but O
I’ll O
never O
know O
their O
situation O
for O
sure. O
[SEP]
That’s O
fair. O
I O
don’t O
think O
OP O
is O
wrong O
not O
to O
want O
the O
guy O
anywhere O
near O
them O
though. O
Hopefully O
they O
can O
get O
her O
out. O
[SEP]
While O
being O
abused O
you O
start O
to O
change O
yourself O
for O
your O
partner O
you O
try O
to O
become O
more O
likable O
it’s O
practically O
brainwashing. O
She O
could O
have O
been O
confused O
and O
laughed O
as O
a O
nervous O
reaction O
[SEP]
as O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
abused O
and O
is O
both O
B O
and O
T O
I O
can't O
agree O
less. O
it O
is O
not O
the O
job O
of O
those O
around O
us O
to O
get O
us O
out O
of O
these O
situations O
and O
besides, O
it O
seems O
like O
OP O
has O
voiced O
concerns O
and O
the O
abuse O
isn't O
under O
the O
table. O
I'm O
sorry O
but O
abuse O
victim O
or O
not O
it O
is O
perpetuating O
homophobia. O
To O
the O
abuser O
she O
isn't O
going O
along O
with O
it O
because O
he's O
an O
abuser O
she's O
going O
along O
with O
it O
because O
she O
agrees O
and O
if O
she O
agrees O
then O
others O
agree O
and O
now O
not O
only O
are O
his O
actions O
of O
abuse O
okay O
but O
his O
homophobic O
ideology. O
I'm O
not O
going O
to O
pretend O
it's O
okay O
my O
best O
friend O
is O
saying O
I'm O
sinful O

disgusting O
even O
if O
it's O
"because" O

So, O
I O
currently O

Obviously O
I'm O

I O
have O
sympathy, O
but O
the O
truth O
is, O
I O
*don't* O
understand O
these O

It O
hurts O
my O
brain O
and O
my O
heart O
to O
listen O
to O
some O
of O
the O
things O
the O
other O
women O
say O
about O
going O
back O
to O
their O
old O
lives O
when O
they O
literally O
survived O
attempted O
murder. O

[SEP]
Several O
people, O
including O
my O
Stepmum, O
have O
made O
comments O
about O
me O
going O
back O
to O
my O
ex. O
I O
shut O
that O
shit O
down O

fast. O
It O
makes O
me O
angry O
that O
anyone O
would O
think O
I O
could O
put O
myself O
through O

again. O
Getting O
back O
in O
my O
own O
place O
and O
living O
my O
old O
life O
again O
is O
all O
I O
can O
think O
about. O

He O
threw O
me O
down O

He O
drank O
everyday O
and O
smoked O

like O
it O
was O
going O

He O
constantly O
talked O
about O
what O
I O
needed O

be O
doing O

even O
though O
I O
gave O
up O
most O

move O
across O

I O
loved O

I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
burn O
myself O
to O
the O
ground O
to O
baby O
his O
emotionally O
broken O
psyche. O
[SEP]
But O
she O
called O
OP O
to O
apologize O
for O
his O
behavior. O
If O
she's O
been O
so O
brainwashed O
by O
him, O
why O
do O
make O
the O
call O
in O
the O
first O
place? O
[SEP]
You O
want O
to O
reach O
out O
when O
you’re O
in O
that O
situation O
just O
sometimes O
you O
can’t O
do O
it O
safely. O
Which O
is O
why O
she O
waited O
while O
he O
wasn’t O
around. O
[SEP]
Right. O
She O
called O
when O
she O
knew O
she O
could O
speak O
safely. O
So O
when O
asked O
if O
she O
agreed O
with O
the O
things O
he O
said, O
she O
was O
free O
to O
say O
'no, O
I O
absolutely O

not' O

she O
didn't O
say O
that. O

you O
went O
to O
school O
today. O
You O
made O
me O
look O
so O
stupid O
when O
she O
came! O
HOW O
DARE O
YOU!” O
Then O
she O
cuffs O
me O
upside O
the O
head O
as O
spit O
flew O
from O
her O
mouth, O
spoiling O
the O
clean O
table. O

“She’s O
going O
to O
take O
you O
from O
here. O
You’re O
going O
to O
go O
live O
with O
strangers, O
you O
deserve O
that”, O
I O
shifted O
slowly O
to O
the O
edge O
of O
my O
seat O
so O
that O
when O
I O
fell O
it O
would O
look O
worse O
than O
it O
was. O
I O
knew O
where O
this O
was O
going. O
Nowhere O
good. O
[SEP]
“I O
said O
look O
at O
me O
when O
I’m O
talking O
to O
you.” O
Anger O
lit O
her O
voice O
up O
making O
it O
sound O
so O
venomous O
that O
I O
physically O
flinched. O
My O
brother O
peeked O
around O
the O
corner, O
concerned. O
In O
the O
backroom O
I O
could O
hear O
my O
sister O
playing O
with O
the O
hot O
wheels, O
probably O
making O
a O
horrid O
mess. O
Glancing O
at O
her O
would O
only O
make O
things O
worse. O
Shifting O
in O
my O
chair O
even O
closer O
to O
the O
edge, O
I O
replied O
with O
a O
meek O
voice, O
[SEP]
“Yes O
ma’am, O
I’m O
sorry.” O
WHAM. O
I O
fell O
off O
my O
chair O
with O
an O
audible O
thud O
to O
the O
hard O
floor. O
“Sorry? O
You O
will O
be O
sorry. O
They O
are O
going O
to O
do O
horrible O
things O
to O
you. O
Rip O
you O
away O
from O
here O
like O
you O
deserve O
you O
lazy O
bitch”. O
She O
stood O
above O
me. O
But O
at O
least O
she O
hadn’t O
noticed O
my O
brother. O
[SEP]
I O
could O
hear O
my O
sister O
calling O
for O
him O
in O
the O
back O
room. O
He O
hesitates, O
as O
this O
happens O
she O
whips O
her O
head O
toward O
the O
sound. O
She O
sees O
him. O
[SEP]
“Mom, O
I'm O
sorry O
I O
didn’t O
mean O
to O
forget, O
I’ll O
go O
do O
it O
right O
now” O
I O
quickly O
get O
to O
my O
feet. O
“Right O
now O
won’t O
fix O
it” O
she O
replied, O
once O
again O
her O
attention O
focusing O
like O
a O
snake O
about O
to O
strike. O
But O
I O
could O
see O
her O
calming O
down. O
I O
slowly O
move O
past O
her O
to O
go O
into O
the O
kitchen. O
[SEP]
“She O
is O
coming O
Friday. O
Make O
sure O
this O
house O
is O
clean,” O
Her O
voice O
normalizing, O
as O
I O
could O
slowly O
see O
the O
thoughts O
moving O
across O
her O
face, O
I O
could O
see O
her O
shifting O
back O
into O
mom. O
It’s O
like O
watching O
her O
become O
another O
person. O
This O
side O
of O
her O
made O
things O
livable. O
[SEP]
“Spaghetti O
sounds O
good O
for O
dinner. O
Do O
we O
have O
bread? O
Garlic O
bread O
and O
spaghetti, O
you O
always O
make O
the O
best O
spaghetti” O
her O
voice O
was O
becoming O
normal. O
She O
attempted O
a O
hug. O
Forcing O
myself O
not O
to O
flinch, O
I O
hug O
her O
back. O
[SEP]
“Yes O
that O
sounds O
awesome.” O
Letting O
go O
a O
little O
too O
quickly, O
I O
feel O
myself O
relaxing O
a O
little. O
My O
brother O
and O
sister O
are O
playing; O
she O
is O
calming O
down. O
Dinner O
is O
planned, O
and O
she O
seems O
happy O
with O
it. O
[SEP]
Now, O
the O
trick O
is O
to O
get O
everything O
done O
before O
it’s O
time O
to O
get O
the O
kids O
to O
bed. O
[SEP]
“Love O
you O
mom. O
I’ll O
come O
get O
you O

Isn’t O
the O
news O
coming O
on O
soon?” O
As O
she O
walks O
into O
the O
living O
room O
to O
watch O
the O
news, O
I O
grab O
the O
pot O
and O
start O
filling O
it O
with O
water O
for O
the O
noodles. O
I O
feel O
my O

start O

I O

( O
Early O

We O
didn't O
even O
get O
a O
phone O
until O
I O
was O
16. O
We O
were O

She O

telling O

horrific O
things O

at O

drop O
us O

away O

say O
things O

even O
foster O

both O

So O
both O

I'm O

you're O
out O

Are O
your O

out O
too? O
[SEP]
Yes O
and O
no. O
Bio O
died O

So O
we O
r O
free. O
However O
none O

us O
have O

Trauma O

We O
have O
all O
hurt O
each O
other O
over O
the O
years O
bc O
we O
didn't O
know O
any O
better. O
Therapy O
for O
8 O
years O
taught O
me O
that O
I O
can't O
just O
pretend O
it O
didn't O
happen O
so O
they O
don't O
like O
me O
bc O
I O
won't O
sugar O
coat O
what O
happened. O
Right O
now O
none O
of O
us O
talk O
to O
each O
other. O
Idk O
if O
that O
will O
ever O
change. O
😕 O
[SEP]
Maybe O
one O
day O
your O
siblings O
will O
get O
therapized O
too. O
If O
you O
all O
understand O
why O
you O
were O
the O
way O
you O
were O
and O
can O
move O
past O
it O
together, O
you O
can O
have O
some O
sort O
of O
relationship O
[SEP]
I O
hope O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
I O
am O
the O
happiest O
I O
have O
ever O
been. O
Not O
having O
to O
worry O
about O
them O
and O
what O
horror O
is O
next. O
They O
both O
have O
kids O
that's O
the O
part O
that O
makes O
me O
sad. O
I B-Age
am I-Age
35 I-Age
and O
still O
debating O
on O
if O
I'm O
going O
to O
have O
one. O
The O

I O

was O
just O
1 O
day O
out O
of O
my O
entire O
life O
before O
21. O
[SEP]
I'm O
opting O
out O
of O
children. O
That O
way O
I O
definitely O
won't O
be O
continuing O
the O
cycle O
of O
abuse. O
Also, O
I O
intensely O
don't O
want O
them. O
[SEP]
I O
get O
this. O
I O
want O
a O
kid O
but O
the O
cycle O
of O
abuse O
is O
making O
me O
2nd O
guess O
everything. O
I O
also O
have O
a O
genetic O
disorder O
that O
might O
be O
passed O
down O
so O
idk O
[SEP]
I O
just O
don't O
like O
being O
around O
kids. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also, O
I B-Mental_Health
get I-Mental_Health
crippling I-Mental_Health
migraines, I-Mental_Health
just B-Family
like I-Family
my I-Family
mom, I-Family
and O
I've B-Time
had I-Time
them I-Time
since I-Time
I I-Time
was I-Time
SEVEN. I-Time
I'm O
not O
doing O
that O
to O
someone O
else. O
And B-Family
Alzheimer's I-Family
on I-Family
dad's I-Family
side. I-Family
And O
cancer O
late O
in O
life O
on O
both O
sides. O
And O
a O
predisposition O
to O
addiction O
on O
both O
sides. O
Apparently O
I O
might O
be O
a O
carrier O
for O
Downs. O
And O
that O
pesky O
little O
narcissism O
thing. O
Too O
many O
things O
that O
I O
wouldn't O
wish O
on O
anyone. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
only O
thing O
I O
regret O
about O
not O
having O
kids O
is O
that O
I'm O
killing O
my O
clone O
line. O
I O
look O
almost O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
my O
mom, O
but O
I'm O
slightly O
shorter. O
She O
looks O
almost O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
her O
mom, O
except O
her O
eyes O
are O
blue. O
Grandmother O
looks O
exactly O
like O
her O
mom. O
And O
her O
mom, O
and O
her O
mom, O
and O
her O
mom, O
as O
far O
back O
as O
we O
have O
photographic O
records. O
I O
have O
photographs O
of O
myself O
standing O
outside O
hospital O
in O
Ireland, O
just O
having O
finished O
nursing O
school O
in O
the O
mid O
1800s. O
I O
have O
photos O
of O
myself O
hanging O
out O
with O
my O
grandparents O
two O
years O
before O
I O
was O
born O
and O
I O
put O
them O
on O
Facebook O
with O
the O
year O
underneath, O
and O
nobody O
has O
questioned O
it. O
They've O
been O
up O
for O
years O
and O
nobody O
has O
said O
anything. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It's O
weird O
as O
hell. O
It's O
like O
every O
generation O
picks O
one, O
new, O
shiny O
trait O
from O
the O
male, O
and O
completely O
throws O
away O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
DNA. O
It O
somehow O
feels O
wrong O
to O
end O
this O
genetic O
streak. O
But O
it O
also O
feels O
wrong O
to O
have O
a O
kid O
just O
for O
a O

Throwaway, O

[SEP]
[SEP]
After B-Time

working B-Occupation

on I-Occupation
a I-Occupation

I’m O
looking O

do O
my O

Snap-on O
doesn’t O
have O
much O
in O

I’ve O
seen O

I’ve O
had O
a O

Cornwell, O
but O

[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
I’m O
thinking O
about O
buying O
a O
truck O
and O
stocking O
it O
full O
of O
good O

Things O
like O
lang, O

wright, O
gray O
pneumatic, O
sunnex, O
mayhew, O
gear O
wrench, O
vim, O
ez O
red, O
etc. O
the O
point O
is O
to O
have O
good O
stuff O
and O
a O
great O
selection O
at O
fair O
prices. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
I O
believe O
I O
can O
be O
competitive, O
but O
probably O
won’t O
beat O
Amazon O
on O
everything. O
Is O
that O
a O
problem? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Have O
you O
ever O
been O
on O
an O

Would O
you O
give O
one O
a O
try? O
Am O
I O
missing O
anything? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Thanks! O
[SEP]
I’m O
sure O
you O
probably O
already O
know O
this O
but O
I’d O
reach O
out O
to O
the O
Mobile O
Tool O
network O
and O
see O
what O
it O
would O
take O
to O
get O
setup O
with O
them O
as O
a O
first O
step. O
I O
think O
an O
independent O
guy O
can O
make O
it O
as O
long O
as O
you’re O
good O
to O
your O
customers. O
Also O
take O
a O
look O
at O
what O
the O

guys O
carry O
those O
are O
the O

that O
would O

too. O
[SEP]
I O
had O
an O

Get O
you O
anything O
you O
wanted. O
Super O
nice O
guy. O
Did O
business O
with O
him O
so O
long O
I O
didn’t O
have O
a O
truck O
credit O
limit O
with O
him. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
you’re O
hurdle O
will O
be O
the O
lack O
of O
revolving O
credit O
line O
and O
warranty O
work. O
The O
truck O
functions O
as O
a O
line O
of O
credit O
for O
both O
the O
techs O
and O
the O
owner. O
Without O
the O
backing O
of O
the O
company O
your O
float O
will O
be O
difficult O
to O
manage. O
If O
you O
have O
experience O
managing O
multiple O
net O
30/60/90 O
accounts O
with O
separate O
businesses O
then O
you O
have O
a O
leg O
up O
but O
it O
will O
be O
tricky. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
are O
you O
planning O
on O
purchasing O
your O
stock? O
If O
a O
tool O
breaks, O
are O
you O
backing O
it? O
Will O
you O
swap O
it O
on O
the O
spot O
and O
send O
in O
the O
old O
one O
on O
your O
own O
credit? O

If O
Amazon O
can O
have O
the O
thing O
in O
my O
hand O
by O
4am O
the O
next O
day O
and O
you O
only O
come O
once O
a O
week O
that’s O
another O
hurdle. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
assuming O
you O
won’t O
deal O
with O
boxes, O
but O
that O
is O
a O
huge O
margin O
item. O
Trade O
in’s O
on O
promo O
boxes O
and O
keeping O
the O
tech O
on O
a O
constant O
payment O
schedule O
is O
how O
you O
keep O
the O
lights O
on O
for O
30 O
years. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
not O
saying O
it’s O
not O
possible, O
just O
saying O
there O
is O
a O
reason O
it’s O
not O
more O
prolific. O
I O
am O
also O
not O
supporting O
the O
snap O
on O
mode O
either. O
I O
almost O
bought O
a O
truck O
about O
5 O
years O
ago O
but O
ultimately O
decided O
it O
wasn’t O
worth O
it. O
Snap O
on O
purposely O
keeps O
their O
trucks O
at O
about O
$100k O
a O
year O
net. O
If O
you O
exceed O
it O
then O
good O
for O
you, O
but O
your O
route O
will O
be O
divided O
up O
sooner O
or O
later. O
Owning O
multiple O
routes O
and O
hiring O
drivers/salesman O
to O
run O
the O
route O
at O
say O
80% O
of O
net O
is O
really O
the O
only O
way O
it O
would O
be O
“worth O
it” O
in O
my O
book. O
The O
ability O
to O
order O
tools O
straight O
from O
snap O
ons O
website O
also O
didn’t O
sit O
well O
with O
me. O
The O
truck O
basically O
becomes O
a O
credit O
card O
(that O
you O
under O
sign) O
and O
a O
warranty O
spot. O
The O
only O
people O
that O
need O
the O
truck O
are O
the O
people O
that O
need O
to O
make O
payments. O

I'm O
a O
little O
late O
to O
this O
convo O
but O
I B-Occupation
own I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
small I-Occupation
shop I-Occupation
with O
a O
handful O
of O
guys. O
If O
I O
knew O
of O
an O
independent O
carrying O
quality O
brands O
(tekton, O
sunex, O
gearwrench) O
I O
would O
absolutely O
encourage O
everyone O
to O
do O
business. O
Currently O
we O
only O
have O
a O
Snap O
On O
truck O
which O
I O
buy O
off O
of O
but O
the O
guy O
who O
is O
changing O
oil O
and O
rotating O
tires O
has O
no O
need O
for O
$300 O
impact O
sockets. O
[SEP]
Look O
up O
techs O
choice/ O
koons O
Trucking O
on O
youtube O
[SEP]
We O
have O
a O
independent O
guy. O
He’s O
geared O
more O
toward O
body O
shop O
work O
than O
automotive O
but O
he’s O
been O
around O
forever O
one O
of O
my O
coworkers O
has O
been O
buyin O
tools O
from O
him O
for O
like O
20 O
years O
lol O
he O
also O
sells O
stuff O
for O
the O
same O
price O
as O
they O
are O
on O
Amazon O
(gear O
wrench O
and O
sunnex O
and O
whatnot) O
not O
sure O
how O
maybe O
he O
has O
commercial O
account O
and O
gets O
things O
cheaper. O
But O
he O
also O
doesn’t O
have O
a O
set O
territory O
like O
other O
tool O
trucks O
so O
he O
can O
go O
where O
ever O
he O
wants! O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin. O
This O
has O
been O
on O
my O
mind O
lately O
too. O
[SEP]
Way O
late O
seeing O
this O
thread O
but O
I O
will O
say O
I O
have O
an O
independent O
dealer O
that O
came O
from O
one O
of O
the O
big O
brands O
and O
absolutely O
solid O
guy, O
carries O
most O
of O
the O
brands O
you O
listed O
and O
a O
few O
more O
and O
is O
always O
reliable O
and O
has O
good O
prices. O
Not O
sure O
if O
this O
is O
a O
pro O
or O
a O
con O
but O
he O
also O
has O
his O
own O
sorta O
premium O
you O
can O
pay O
monthly/yearly O
and O
you O
get O
so O
much O
off O
the O
items O
and O
some O
free O
stuff O
but O
has O
never O
pressured O
anyone O
to O
join O
[SEP]
\+1 O
for O
Mobile O
tool O
network O
[SEP]
Thanks, O
I’m O
set O
up O
with O
them. O
So O
you’d O
give O
an O
independent O
a O
try? O
And O
you O
think O
an O
independent O
can O
bring O
enough O
to O
the O
table O
without O
shiny O
new O
epics O
and O
company O
flag? O
[SEP]
Nice! O
It O
makes O
me O
nervous O
because O
I O
haven’t O
seen O
any O
independents O
out O
there O
in O
my O
area. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Was O
there O
certain O
things O
you O
liked O
his O
truck O
for O
over O
the O
flaged O
trucks? O
What O
would O
you O
like O
to O
see O
on O
one O
that O
showed O
up? O
[SEP]
Yes O
that’s O
right, O
I’ll O
have O
to O
float O
the O
ra. O
I’ll O
purchase O
inventory O
from O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
wholesalers. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
plan O
on O
taking O
care O
of O
my O
own O
warranties O
out O
of O
my O
stock, O
then O
send O
it O
in O
later. O
The O
tricky O
part O
will O
be O
how O
far O
does O
that O
extend? O
Obviously O
I’ll O
warranty O
stuff O
I O
sell, O
but O
if O
someone O
has O
a O
product O
I O
sell O
and O
they O
didn’t O
buy O
it O
from O
me, O
I’m O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
should O
still O
cover O
it? O
I’m O
guessing O
it’ll O
be O
depending O
on O
the O
customer O
and O
the O
relationship. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
No O
probably O
won’t O
deal O
much O
in O
boxes, O
except O
maybe O
used. O
Again O
a O
bit O
harder O
when O
I O
have O
to O
carry O
the O
note O
on O
everything. O
[SEP]
Thanks! O
That’s O
actually O
why O
I O
started O
thinking O
of O
going O
independent. O
Lol O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
you’d O
give O
an O
independent O
a O
try? O
You O
think O
there’s O
a O
market O
and O
a O
place O
for O
them? O
[SEP]
Yeah O
looking O
at O
wholesalers O
it’s O
going O
to O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
shopping O
around O
to O
be O
competitive. O
Amazon O
is O
tough O
to O
beat. O
And O
in O
many O
cases O
I O
probably O
just O
won’t O
be O
able O
to. O
[SEP]
Oh O
really? O
Looking O
around O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
pretty O
plausible O
enterprise O
to O
me. O
I’m O
nervous O
for O
mostly O
previously O
mentioned O
reasons. O
[SEP]
On O
the O
snapon O
side O
here. O
My O
guys O
buy O
from O
me. O
They O
love O
the O
brand, O
but O
a O
large O
part O
of O
the O
loyalty O
is O
to O
who O
they O
buy O
from. O
I O
don't O
think O
you O
would O
make O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
money O
going O
independent O
as O
you O
would O
with O
the O
snapon O
brand O
at O
your O
back, O
but O
you O
would O
be O
free O
to O
do O
what O
you O
want O
as O
you O
want. O
[SEP]
I O
been O
in O
22 O
years O
so O
I O
like O
to O
see O
new O
shit. O
He O
carried O
a O
bunch O
of O
gear O
wrench, O
sunex, O
Milwaukee, O
Monster, O
but O
he O
could O
get O
you O
anything O
you O
wanted. O
[SEP]
Coyle O
tools O
is O
another O
independent O
guy O
on O
YouTube O
that O
might O
be O
worth O
your O
time O
to O
check O
out. O
[SEP]
If O
I O
had O
an O
independent O
truck O
coming O
to O
my O
dealership O
I O
would O
spend O
way O
more O
than O
I’d O
like O
to O
admit. O
I O
personally O
buy O
tools O
of O
quality, O
price O
and O
convenience. O
I O
think O
an O
independent O
truck O
would O
provide O
the O
perfect O
mix O
of O
all O
3. O
I O
think O
there O
is O
a O
good O
market O
for O
it. O
[SEP]
You O
aren't O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
beat O
Amazon O
on O
price. O
You O
may O
be O
able O
to O
find O
some O
wholesalers O
to O
buy O
things O
5% O
cheaper O
than O
Amazon O
but O
you O
won't O
be O
able O
to O
make O
a O
living O
selling O
cheaper O
than O
Amazon. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
will O
be O
selling O
service, O
convenience O
and O
easy O
payments. O
[SEP]
For O
sure. O
I O
think O
whatever O
the O
truck O
it O
should O
have O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
loaded O
in O
it O
and O
some O
of O
the O
oddities O
or O
new O
stuff O
you O
haven’t O
seen. O
[SEP]
And O
that’s O
kind O
of O
what O
I O
was O
thinking. O
I’m O
a O
bit O
afraid O
that O
it’s O
not O
as O
exclusive O
as O
a O
brand O
like O
snap-on. O
You O
can O
buy O
most O
of O
this O
off O
Amazon, O
and O
in O
many O
cases O
just O
a O
bit O
cheaper. O
I’m O
hoping O
having O
it O
in O
stock, O
financing, O
good O
service O
and O
warranty O
is O
enough O
to O
convince O
someone O
to O
buy O
from O
me, O
rather O
than O
shop O
the O
truck O
and O
go O
home O
and O
purchase O
from O
Jeff O
bezos. O
[SEP]
Personally, O
I O
prefer O
to O
keep O
my O
money O
local O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
and O
try O
not O
to O
support O
the O
huge O
guys O
like O
amazon, O
etc. O
The O
older O
I O
get, O
I O
see O
the O
importance O
of O
supporting O
the O
independents. O
I'll O
pay O
more O
(within O
reason) O
and O
give O
up O
some O
convenience O
to O
do O
business O
with O
people O
that O
I O
like. O

Is O
your O

asking O

if O
your O
parts O
are O
compatible, O
or O
to O
help O
your O
price-performance/cost O
of O
total O
build? O
Right O
now, O
you O
are O
overspending O
a O
lot O
in O
various O
parts O
of O
the O
build O
and O
unfortunately O
have O
purchased O
the O
mobo O
already. O
As O
for O
performance O
and O
cost, O
I’d O
recommend O
a O
360mm O
aio O
for O
better O
looks O
and O
airflow O
although O
the O
tower O
cooler O
should O
be O
ok O
without O
heavy O
overclocking. O
Motherboard O
would’ve O
been O
better O
as O
z690 O
+ O
ddr4 O
since O
z790 O
is O
expensive O
and O
not O
really O
useful O
for O
the O
cost O
unless O
you O
use O
ddr5 O
(z690 O
is O
cheaper O
and O
has O
boards O
supporting O
ddr5 O
too). O
As O
for O
the O
ram, O
try O
to O
get O
the O
lowest O
cost O
of O

For O

is O
ok O
but O
overpriced O
imo. O
I’d O
look O
at O

like O

more O

g360a O

look O
at O

get O

you’re O

it’s O

[SEP]
I'm O
just O
looking O
to O
get O
impressions O
from O
people O
who O
know O
more O
about O
what O
they're O
talking O
about, O
so O
thank O
you. O
I O
chose O
the O
z790 O
over O
z690 O
because O
this O
particular O
board O
has O
a O
lot O
more O
back O
panel O
inputs O
that O
are O
useful O
for O
my O
work O
and O
the O
devices O
I O
have. O
The O
other O
thing O
is O
that O
I'm O
hoping O
to O
get O
the O
fans, O
the O
cpu O
cooler, O
the O
ram, O
possibly O
the O
case, O
or O
money O
to O
help O
purchase O
them O
as O
Christmas O
gifts. O
So O
with O
that, O
and O
that O
I'm O
not O
buying O
any O
new O
storage O
or O
OS, O
I O
feel O
okay O
with O
spending O
a O
bit O
on O
other O
parts. O
[SEP]
I've O
heard O
that O
AIOs O
can O
be O
overkill O
and O
less O
reliable O
than O
fan O
cooling. O
Do O
you O
have O
a O
AIO O
you'd O
recommend? O
And O
do O
you O
have O
a O
particular O
wattage O
you O
think O
I O
should O
get O
for O
a O
PSU? O
[SEP]
Ah O
I O
see. O
For O
aio O
I’d O
recommend O
Arctic O
freezer O
ii O
as O
it O
has O
quiet O
operation O
and O
great O
cooling O
performance O
(also O
has O
a O
vrm O
fan O
on O
the O
pump). O
For O
wattage O
I O
think O
1200w O
would O
be O
safer O
(I O
roughly O
estimated O
by O
750w O
times O
1.5 O
and O
added O
100w O
since O
you O
have O
3080 O
ti O
which O
can O
have O
voltage O
spikes). O
But O
1000w O
and O
even O
850w O
would O
probably O
work O
without O
problems O
(could O
limit O
oc O
potential). O
[SEP]
Ah O
so O
your O
problem O
with O
the O
psu O
I O
chose O
was O
with O
the O
cert, O
not O
the O
wattage. O
Thank O
you O
for O

It O

your O
view O

in O

You O
do O
not O
want O
to O
see O
yourself O

your O

you O
want O
to O
set O
an O

A O
superiority O
complex O
will O
get O
you O
into O
trouble O
down O
the O

issues O
you O
don't O

It's O
the O
biggest O
difference O
when O
transitioning O
from O
an O
employee O
to O
a O
business O
owner, O
you O
no O
longer O
have O

yourself O

you O

Never O
run O
a O

You O

Machiavellian… O

the O

you O

your O

is O
just O
vile O
in O
my O
opinion O
… O
now O
, O
I O
see O
business O
as O
a O
competition O
but O
I O
usually O
beat O
my O
competition O
the O
right O
way, O
by O
putting O
in O
more O
work O

just O
for O

not O

humíllate O
anyone O

even O

you O
did O
all O
the O

I O

nope O
I’ve O

i O
don’t O

I O

I O
think O
one O

[SEP]
Hello O
everyone, O
this O
is O
my O
first O
post O
here. O
I’m B-Family
not I-Family
a I-Family
gambler I-Family
but I-Family
my I-Family
brother I-Family
in I-Family
law I-Family
is. I-Family
He O
started O
gambling O
in O
2018 O
when O
he O
moved O
to O
Australia. O
He O
lost O
a O
ton O
of O
money O
and O
he O
vowed O
he O
will O
stop. O
He O
didn’t O
gamble O
for O
3 O
years, O
during O
which O
he O
had O
a O
baby. O
Everything O
was O
going O
great O
until O
he O
relapsed O
around O
6 O
months O
ago, O
and O
he O
lost O
around O
$12K. O
He O
promised O
he’d O
stop. O
But O
he O
relapsed O
again O
a O
couple O
days O
ago. O
Our O
family O
is O
tensed O
and O
really O
worried. O
I’d O
love O
it O
if O
you O
guys O
could O
give O
any O
suggestions O
on O
how O
we O
can O
help O
him O
with O
this O
addiction. O

Maybe O
discuss O
someone O
he O
trusts O
looking O
after O
his O

for O
accountability. O
[SEP]
You O
can’t O
help O
him… O
he O
needs O
to O
help O
himself. O
This O
is O
the O
honest O
truth. O
[SEP]

the O

deal O
with O
this O
traumatic O
situation. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
advice. O
I’ll O
look O
into O
this. O
[SEP]
Currently O
his O
wife O
holds O
access O
to O
all O
the O
finances. O
But O
anytime O
he O
gets O
access, O
its O
like O
he’s O
a O
different O
person O
and O
a O
demon O
gets O
hold O
of O
him, O
and O
he O
starts O
gambling. O
The O
relapse O
I O
mentioned O
took O
place O
when O
his O
wife O
forgot O
they O
had O
an O
existing O
credit O
card. O
So O
I O
feel O
like O
this O
wouldn’t O
be O
a O
sustainable O
solution. O
[SEP]
Hmm O
that’s O
absolutely O
true O
but O
I’m O
hoping O
there’s O
a O
way O
to O
help O
him O
help O
himself? O
[SEP]
You O
can’t O
help O
him O
help O
himself. O
It O
his O
decision O
alone O
and O
he O
has O
to O
figure O
it O
out O
if O
he O
wants O
to. O
I O
get O
really O
annoyed O
at O
some O
of O
the O
“advice” O
found O
here O
that O
basically O
says O
someone O
needs O
to O
“control” O
the O
gambler. O
That O
will O
never O
work O
and O
instead O
brings O
other O
people O
down O
with O
him/her. O
I O
also O
highly O
disagree O
that O
gambling O
is O
a O
disease. O
What O
I’ve O
found O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
very O
addictive O
activity O
that O
is O
likely O
covering O
for O
something O
else O
in O
your O
life. O
Anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
quit O
can O
find O
resources O
and O
help O
and O
doesn’t O
need O
your O
help O
finding O
it. O

there O
were O
a O

of O
signs O
that O
something O
isn't O
right O
in O
my O

childhood. O
[SEP]
I O
haven't O
had O
a O
panic O
attack O
in O
many O
years, O
I O
still O
tend O
to O
worry O
too O
much O
and O
look O
out O
for O
potential O
dangers O
that O
could O
be O
too O
stressful O
to O
me. O
[SEP]
But O
I O
have O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
progress O
over O
the O
years. O
Since O
it O
was O
such O
a O
gradual O
progress, O
it O
sometimes O
feels O
like O
I O
haven't O
learned O
anything. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
to O
remind O
myself O
that O
I O
did, O
by O
remembering O
how O
it O
used O
to O
be O
and O
how O
much O
everyday O
tasks, O
like O
buying O
groceries O
were O
a O
huge O
problem O
back O
then. O
[SEP]
One O
of O
the O
things O
I O
learned O
was O
that O
my B-Mental_Health
anxiety I-Mental_Health
can I-Mental_Health
be I-Mental_Health
triggered I-Mental_Health
by I-Mental_Health
my I-Mental_Health
thoughts I-Mental_Health
but I-Mental_Health
also I-Mental_Health
how I-Mental_Health
I I-Mental_Health
feel I-Mental_Health
physically. I-Mental_Health
[SEP]
Due B-Mental_Health
to I-Mental_Health
my I-Mental_Health
anxiety I-Mental_Health
disorder I-Mental_Health
I O
learned O
to O
"scan" O
my O
body O
in O
stressful O
situations. O
[SEP]
"There's O
too O
many O
people O
in O
this O
room, O
the O
air O
is O
so O
thick O
in O
here, O
I O
can't O
breathe O
properly." O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
like O
warm/hot O
weather O
for O
example. O
I O
think O
I O
struggle O
more O
mentally O
in O
these O
days. O
[SEP]
The O
physical O
symptoms O
of O
sweating, O
raised O
heartbeat, O
more O
focus O
on O
the O
breathing, O
because O
of O
the O
heat, O
are O
the O
same O
symptoms O
that O
appeared O
when O
I O
had O
a O
panic O
attack. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Another O
example O
is O
a O
bad O
night O
sleep, O
when O
I O
wake O
up O
and O
feel O
all O
mushy O
and O
not O
really O
fit O
and O
awake. O
[SEP]
That O
feeling O
of O
not O
being O
in O
the O
presence O
and O
feeling O
disconnected O
from O
reality O
is O
something O
I O
know O
from O
my O
panic O
attacks. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
look O
for O
the O
triggers, O
because O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell, O
from O
my O
experience, O
I O
could O
always O
find O
a O
trigger. O
It O
never O
came O
out O
of O
nowhere, O
at O
least O
in O
my O
case. O
[SEP]
Idk, O
for O
me O
the O
worst O
is O
migraine O
anxiety O
coupled O
with O
I-just-had-an-argument-with-my-partner O
anxiety. O
Thankfully O
I O
have O
a O
kind O
partner O
whose O
reassurances O
keep O
me O
from O
going O
off O
the O
deep O
end. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
in O
a O
similar O
boat, O
but O
without O
a O
probable O
cause O
like O
your O
chronic O
pain. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Maybe O
because O
final O
(college) O
week O
is O
approaching? O
My O
grades O
are O
fine O
though. O
😞 O
[SEP]
So O
I’m B-Health
on I-Health
a I-Health
medication I-Health
that I-Health
helps I-Health
with I-Health
daily I-Health
“normal” I-Health
anxiety, I-Health
like O
normally O
in O
my O
day O
I O
would O
feel O
a O
constant O
sense O
of O
foreboding. O
But O
occasionally O
I O
will O
get O
an O
actual O
panic O
attack O
that O
my O
normal O
medicine O
can’t O
handle, O
like O
this O
one. O
Usually O
it’s O
triggered O
by O
something O
like O
watching O
something O
scary, O
but O
sometimes O
it O
feels O
like O
there’s O
no O
cause O
like O
this O
time. O
When O
that O
happens O
I O
take O
an O
as O
needed O
pill O
that O
in O
around O
30 O
min O
calms O
me O
down. O
I O
don’t O
use O
that O
one O
often, O
it’s O
kind O
of O
for O
emergencies O
I O
guess O
because O
otherwise O
I’d O
probably O
want O
to O
go O
to O
the O
ER O
lol O
[SEP]
That’s O
true, O
I O
will O
admit O
prior O
to O
it O
actually O
getting O
bad O
I O
had O
noticed O
that O
I O
felt O
off O
for O
around O
an O
hour O
or O
two. O
I O
should O
have O
probably O
taken O
my O
medicine O
then O
in O
order O
to O
prevent O
it, O
but O
for O
some O
reason O
I’m O
really O
bad O
about O
taking O
preventative O
measures. O
I’m O
always O
like O
“maybe O
it O
will O
go O
away” O
or O
“maybe O
it O
won’t O
get O
too O
bad” O
when O
in O
reality O
I O
should O
take O
it O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
start O
feeling O
it O
coming O
on O
so O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
get O
bad O
in O
the O
first O
place O
[SEP]
Finals O
could O
be O
factoring O
in O
a O
little O
bit O
subconsciously O
maybe? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
trying O
to O
learn O
to O
not O
find O
a O
cause O
for O
it. O
I O
almost O
feel O
like O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
invalidate O
the O
anxiety O
by O
finding O
some O
hidden O
root O
cause, O
which O
can O
make O
me O
more O
anxious O
when O
I O
can't O
find O
one. O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
learn O
to O
cope, O
without O
searching O
for O
a O
reason O
or O
cause O
(which O
is O
not O
easy). O
[SEP]
Had O
that O
happen O
once O
😩 O
[SEP]
You O
can O
ask O
yourself O
what O
made O
you O
feel O
off? O
[SEP]
I O
am O
on O
medication O
and O
if O
I O
don't O
take O
it O
I O
will O
feel O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
medication O
wearing O
off O
and O
that's O
not O
pleasant. O
[SEP]
Idk O
if O
that's O
what O
you O
mean. O
[SEP]
Anyway, O
that O
would O
be O
a O
trigger O
in O
it's O
own O
way. O
I O
would O
look O
for O
the O
trigger O
that O
got O
you O
there O
and O
work O
on O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
it. O
[SEP]
By O
dealing O
with O
it O
I O
mean O
not O
getting O
lost O
in O
a O
downward O
spiral O
of O
rumination. O
[SEP]
Try O
to O
catch O
the O
thoughts O
that O
drag O
you O
down, O
make O
you O
feel O
anxious, O
etc. O
and O
put O
them O
to O
scrutiny. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
think O
"You O
are O
not O
strong O
enough O
to O
do O
this, O
it's O
all O
in O
vain, O
just O
don't O
do O
it", O
[SEP]
you O
can O
argue O
that O
you O
at O
least O
want O
to O
try O
it. O
[SEP]
If O
it O
doesn't O
go O
as O
expected, O
you O
can O
at O
least O
be O
proud O
to O
have O
been O
courageous O
and O
strong O
enough O
to O
overcome O
your O
fears O
and O
give O
it O
a O
shot. O
[SEP]
That's O
just O
one O
example, O
you O
can O
look O
for O
the O
thoughts O
in O
your O
head O
that O
probably O
just O
want O
to O
protect O
you O
from O
harm, O
had O
their O
time O
and O
place O
in O
your O
childhood, O
but O
haven't O
grown O
like O
you O
did. O
[SEP]
They O
still O
want O
to O
protect O
the O
little O
boy/girl O
that O
expresses O
itself O
in O
the O
emotions O
you O
feel. O
[SEP]
It O
can O
be O
a O
rabbit O
hole, O
but O
ask O
yourself O
the O
next O
time O
you O
are O
anxious O
what O
root O
lies O
beyond O
that O
specific O
fear? O
[SEP]
Fear O
of O
loneliness? O
Fear O
of O
failure? O
Fear O
of O
lack O
of O
support? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
that O
I O
have O
a O
fear O
of O
failure. O
I O
associate O
failure O
with O
emotional O
pain. O
[SEP]
Worthless, O
lazy, O
inadequate O
etc. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
to O
teach O
the O
part O
of O
me, O
that O
has O
this O
automatic O
response O
of O
thoughts O
to O
failure, O
that O
failure O
means O
much O
more O
than O
just O
these O
negative O
traits. O
[SEP]
It O
also O
means O
learning, O
growing, O
experience O
etc. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
have O
these O
patterns O
of O
behaviour, O
moral O
values, O
the O
do's O
and O
don'ts O
we O
have O
learned O
from O
our O
parents, O
teachers, O
friends, O
society O
from O
an O
early O
age. O
[SEP]
How O
strong O
you O
have O
to O
be O
to O
be O
a O
worthy O
human, O
how O
you O
have O
to O
behave O
in O
certain O
situations, O
etc. O
[SEP]
And O
I O
think O
these O
things O
can O
collide O
with O
the O
needs O
of O
that O
child O
in O
us, O
that O
is O
expressed O
through O
our O
emotions. O
[SEP]
That O
child O
is O
sometimes O
to O
weak O
to O
meet O
these O
demands O
and O
then O
we O
suffer O
emotionally. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
way O
to O
bring O
these O
to O
together, O
the O
"parental O
values" O
and O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
child O
is O
to O
be O
the O
rational O
adult. O
The O
referee, O
talkmaster, O
whatever O
to O
bring O
these O
parts O
together. O
[SEP]
They O
both O
have O
their O
arguments. O
"You O
should O
do O
this O
and O
that. O
You O
have O
to O
be O
like O
this" O
and O
the O
"I O
can't O
to O
this. O
It's O
too O
much." O
[SEP]
The O
role O
of O
the O
adult O
me O
is O
to O
hear O
their O
arguments O
and O
find O
a O
middleground. O
[SEP]
If O
I O
have O
an O
appointment O
I O
am O
scared O
of O
and O
my O
emotional O
(child) O
response O
would O
be O
to O
hide O
and O
don't O
do O
it, O
the O
other O
part O
says O
"but O
you O
have O
to O
do O
it O
(or O
you O
are O
a O
failure)", O
I O
give O
the O
alternative O
to O
try O
it. O
[SEP]
To O
give O
the O
emotional O
side O
breathing O
room O
to O
fail, O
and O
the O
expecting O
and O
demanding O
side O
to O
at O
least O
try O
it. O
[SEP]
It's O
a O
mess O
in O
a O
way, O
but O
it O
is O
what O
it O
is. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
hope O
you O
were O
able O
to O
find O
something O
in O
the O
things O
I O
have O
said O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
Oh O
yeah, O
it’s O
really O
hard O
just O
living O
with O
it. O
Because O
if O
I O
start O
to O
try O
to O
think O
of O
a O
reason, O
my O
mind O
will O
just O
fill O
with O
intrusive O
thoughts O
that O
freak O
me O
out O
and O
make O
it O
worse O

How O
do O
i O
deal O
with O
this O
pharmacy? O
[SEP]
Im B-Occupation
a I-Occupation
pharmacist I-Occupation
at O
an O
independent O
in O
a O
small O
city. O
Right O
down O
the O
road O
from O
my O
pharmacy, O
a O
couple O
of O
the O
chains O
closed O
due O
to O
short O
staffing. O
We O
are O
getting O
an O
influx O
of O
patients O
transferring O
in O
from O
them O
which O
is O
obviously O
great O
for O
business O
but O
theres O
just O
one O
problem... O
[SEP]
[SEP]
They're O
still O
billing O
fucking O
prescriptions O
over O
there. O
So O
i O
call O
them O
up, O
wait O
on O
hold O
for O
more O
than O
2 O
hours, O
and O
am O
eventually O
told O
that O
the O
pharmacy O
is O
closed O
due O
to O
staffing O
so O
they O
have O
no O
ability O
to O
reverse O
claims. O
They O
tell O
me O
to O
call O
a O
different O
store O
and O
do O
a O
central O
lookup/reversal. O
Fine. O
I O
call O
a O
different O
and O
still O
nearby O
store, O
wait O
on O
hold O
another O
45 O
minutes, O
and O
ask O
them O
to O
reverse O
these O
claims O
for O
me. O
They O
tell O
me O
they O
cant O
do O
the O
central O
search O
or O
whatever O
and O
that O
i O
HAVE O
to O
call O
that O
specific O
store O
to O
have O
it O
done. O
So O
i O
tried O
calling O
the O
original O
store O
again O
and O
was O
told O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
that O
the O
pharmacy O
staff O
were O
"on O
lunch". O
I O
called O
back O
one O
final O
time O
and O
was O
told O
that O
the O
pharmacy O
is O
closed, O
try O
again O
tomorrow.. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Patients O
that O
go O
over O
there O
are O
apparently O
being O
told O
the O
pharmacy O
is O
closed O
and O
turned O
away. O
I O
called O
Medicaid O
to O
ask O
about O
override O
possibilities O
and O
was O
told O
the O
dr O
would O
have O
to O
submit O
a O
PA O
for O
early O
refill O
with O
attached O
paperwork O
indicating O
that O
the O
pharmacy O
that O
originally O
billed O
the O
RXs O
was O
closed. O
In O
some O
of O
these O
cases O
by O
the O
time O
all O
of O
that O
actually O
gets O
done O
and O
submitted O
correctly O
the O
medication O
will O
almost O
be O
billable O
again O
anyway. O

Where O
do O
i O
go O
from O
here? O
is O
this O
not O
reaching O
the O
point O
of O
insurance O
fraud? O
Does O
anyone O
know O
any O
chains O
in O
your O
area O
that O
operate O
like O
this? O
[SEP]
sounds O
like O
Walgreens. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
the O
good O
news O
is, O
if O
it O
is O
in O
fact O
a O
Walgreens, O
the O
prescriber O
might O
be O
able O
to O
help O
you. O
When O
they O
send O
an O
eRx O
WAG O
software O
automatically O
bills O
insurance O
99% O
of O
the O
time O
(bad O
for O
those O
of O
us O
trying O
to O
take O
care O
of O
Walgreens O
refugees. O
But O
likewise, O
when O
the O
prescriber O
sends O
Walgreens O
an O
electronic O
cancelation O
of O
the O
same O
script O
Walgreens O
software O
automatically O
reverses O
the O
paid O
claim O
99% O
of O
the O
time. O
So O
save O
yourself O
some O
hold O
time O
and O
ask O
the O
prescriber O
to O
cancel O
the O
Walgreens O
Rx O
electronically. O
A O
lot O
of O
my O
local O
docs O
have O
gotten O
used O
to O
this O
request O
and O
start O
by O
cancelling O
the O
Walgreens O
eRX O
before O
they O
even O
send O
us O
the O
reordered O
eRX. O

1) O
I O
can’t O

2) O
I O
can’t O
see O
the O

you O
sent O

closed O
either. O
It O
was O

If O
you O
continue O
to O
have O
these O
issues, O
contact O
your O
state O

initiate O

Situations O
like O
this O
definitely O
effect O
a O
patient's O
ability O
to O
receive O
their O
meds O
in O
a O
timely O
manner. O
This O
problem O
also O
hinders O
you O
ability O
to O
tend O
to O
your O
current O
patient's O
needs. O
[SEP]
We O
leave O
it O
up O
to O
the O
patient. O
"Walgreens O
has O
a O
paid O
claim. O
have O
them O
reverse O
it." O
If O
they O
can't O
get O
it O
done, O
offer O
to O
cash O
it O
out O
with O
the O
understanding O
that O
we O
may O
be O
able O
to O
rebill O
it O
when O
Walgreens O
reverses O
the O
claim O
but O
no O
promises. O
Not O
the O
greatest O
service, O
but O
if O
you O
act O
like O
it's O
the O

responsibility O
from O

start, O
they O
usually O
accept O
that. O

This O

happening O

2 O
different O
CVS’s O
close O

They’re O

1/3 O

I’ve O
filed O

the O
BOP O
and O
am O
instructing O
every O

that O
transfers O

us O
to O
do O
the O
same. O
If O
there’s O
no O
one O

within O

I O
have O
a O

I'm O
not O
nearly O
as O
patient O
as O
you O
are O

But O
in O
my O

if O
we O

ahold O
of O
anybody O
we O
just O
leave O
a O
voice-mail O
with O
all O
the O
information O
for O
transfer/reversal. O
This O
depends O
on O
your O
state O
laws O
if O
you O
can O
do O
this O
for O
a O
transfer, O
but O
if O
you O
are O
waiting O
on O
a O
reversal O
and O
have O
other O
stuff O
to O
do O
just O
leave O
a O

the O

themself. O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Their O
corporate O
structure O
is O
potentially O
harming O
patients O
(in O
addition O
to O
giving O
you O
unnecessary O
stress/wasted O
time). O
[SEP]
Beyond O
how O
to O
get O
the O
prescription O
billed O
and O
filled O
for O
the O
patient, O
you O
should O
let O
the O
BoP O
know O
about O
this O
situation. O
I O
believe O
OK O
had O
to O
have O
walgreens O
attend O
a O
BoP O
meeting O
over O
the O
summer O
to O
address O
concerns O
about O
unscheduled O
closures O
of O
stores O
and O
the O
negative O
impact O
on O
patients O
(delay O
of O
care, O
closing O
pharmacies O
in O
a O
rural O
area, O
etc). O
[SEP]
You O
report O
them O
to O
your O
licensing O
body O
and O
tell O
the O
patients O
why O
they O
have O
to O
pay O
cash O
and O
give O
them O
the O
info O
to O
report O
to O
their O
insurance O
and O
the O
pharmacies O
licensing O
body. O
[SEP]
I O
would O
call O
your O
state O
board O
of O
pharmacy. O
Sounds O
illegal O
to O
charge O
insurance O
for O
a O
prescription O
you O
never O
sell. O
[SEP]
That O
does O
seem O
like O
fraud. O
Bill O
and O
not O
fill. O
Bill O
and O
fill O
and O
not O
dispense, O
and O
then O
perhaps O
never O
reversing. O
Auditable O
by O
a O
PBM O
as O
well. O
[SEP]
Bill O
out O
of O
pocket O
for O
all O
generics. O
Keep O
your O
price O
cost O
+12$. O
Save O
yourself O
time O
and O
effort. O
Brand O
names O
dont O
worry O
about O
filling O
them. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
also O
a O
Walgreens O
thing… O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If, O
say, O
pt’s O
ins O
was O
billed O
at O
Wag O
A, O
then O
Wag O
A O
closes O
on O
the O
day O
that O
pt O
needs O
the O
med. O
Pt O
can O
go O
to O
Wag O
B O
and O
get O
their O
med O
by O
paying O
out O
of O
pocket O
completely. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Then O
when O
Wag O
A O
opens, O
either O
pt O
or O
Wag O
B O
(preferably O
the O
pt O
ofc) O
calls O
Wag O
A O
to O
reverse O
claim. O
Pt O
then O
goes O
to O
Wag O
B, O
ask O
them O
to O
rebill O
their O
ins, O
and O
get O
a O
refund O
on O
the O
oop O
cost O
(which O
can O
be O
done O
if O
claim O
reversal O
and O
rebill O
happen O
within O
7 O
days) O
[SEP]
If O
it’s O
part O
D, O
call O
the O
fraud O
and O
waste O
hotline O
for O
whatever O
insurance O
it O
is. O
Tell O
them O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
fill O
scripts O
for O
their O
clients O
but O
Walgreens O
has O
billed O
these O
claims O
without O
filling O
them O
which O
is O
fraud. O
You O
could O
get O
a O
10% O

for O
whatever O

they O

[SEP]
Can O
you O
answer O
a O
question O
for O
me O
in O
inbox O
[SEP]
I O
have O
two O
stores O
in O
my O
chain O
that O
closed O
down O
where O
this O
was O
happening. O
Unfortunately O
a O
lot O
of O
scripts O
were O
“lost” O
for O
a O
day O
as O
they O
transitioned O
from O
one O
store O
to O
another, O
but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
they O
transferred O
through O
central O
search O
just O
fine. O
But O
the O
store O
where O
all O
the O
prescriptions O
are O
going O
was O
absolutely O
overwhelmed, O
as O
I’m O
assuming O
the O
store O
you O
called O
also O
was, O
and O
obviously O
only O
the O
pharmacist O
and O
a O
couple O
techs O
were O
experienced O
enough O
to O
have O
good O
standard O
answers O
about O
this. O
A O
store O
closing O
or O
weird O
internal O
transfer O
issues O
are O
not O
something O
that O
happen O
all O
the O
time. O
The O
stores O
that O
closed O
really O
didn’t O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
field O
transfer O
calls—they O
were O
busy O
taking O
inventory O
and O
packing/shipping O
out O
all O
the O
drugs O
to O
my O
own O
store O
(which O
was O
chaos). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
pretty O
sure, O
if O
only O
they O
had O
the O
time, O
the O
store O
you O
called O
could O
put O
in O
a O
ticket O
with O
their O
third O
party O
help O
desk. O
But O
they O
are O
probably O
dealing O
with O
100 O
similar O
issues. O
[SEP]
Email O
the O
state O
board O
and O
tell O
them O
the O
situation. O
Paper O
train. O
Lets O
close O
down O
those O
pharmacies O
for O
good. O
[SEP]
That O
sucks, O
OP. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
would O
just O
find O
a O
discount O
on O
all O
their O
meds, O
and O
tell O
them O
that O
you O
can O
rebill O
it O
with O
the O
insurance O
within O
7 O
days O
if O
they O
can O
get O
it O
settled O
at O
the O
other O
pharmacy. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can’t O
waste O
that O
much O
of O
your O
time O
on O
that O
BS. O
[SEP]
Bring O
the O
list O
of O
orders O
to O
that O
Chain’s O
district O
manager O
biweekly O
and O
have O
them O
reverse O
those O
claims O
overnight O
[SEP]
Whoa O
that O
is O
crazy O
to O
me O
that O
they O
bill O
an O
Rx O
before O
a O
human O
being O
even O
looks O
at O
it, O
and O
is O
a O
terrible O
practice O
if O
they O
can’t O
keep O
their O
stores O
open O
for O
business O
and O
there’s O
no O
other O
way O
to O
reverse O
the O
claims. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
honestly O
would O
consider O
lodging O
a O
complaint O
with O
the O
board O
of O
pharmacy O
for O
delaying O
patient O
care O
with O
this O
practice. O
Maybe O
if O
they O
are O
fined/inspected O
enough O
due O
to O
this O
bullshit O
they O
will O
have O
to O
reconsider O
this O
practice? O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
! O
This O
may O
be O
the O
play O
! O
i O
wasnt O
sure O
about O
rules O
naming O
pharmacies, O
one O
is O
walgreens O
but O
the O
biggest O
culprit O
right O
now O
is O
actually O
a O
rite O
aid. O
Do O
you O
know O
if O
they O
have O
a O
similar O
auto-reverse O
feature O
in O
their O
software? O
[SEP]
It’s O
like O
they O
think O
we O
have O
access O
to O
all O
drug O
info O
for O
every O
patient O
[SEP]
Just O
for O
future O
for O
future O
info….WM O
pharmacies O
started O
closing O
for O
Thanksgiving. O
We’ve O
always O
closed O
for O
Christmas. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
the O
way. O
Make O
sure O
the O
wheels O
of O
government O
know O
about O
the O
issues. O
Create O
a O
paper O
trail. O
If O
they O
refuse O
to O
act, O
the O
media O
will O
have O
a O
field O
day O
with O
it. O
Report O
it O
to O
your O
local O
and O
regional O
news. O
I O
did O
with O
the O
NYT O
and O
it O
made O
a O
big O
wave O
in O
the O
industry. O
[SEP]
> O
24 O
hours O
later O
file O
a O
state O
board O
complaint O
for O
failure O
to O
comply O
with O
request O
to O
transfer. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Not O
all O
states O
make O
it O
mandatory O
to O
transfer O
prescriptions. O
It O
is O
considered O
a O
courtesy. O
If O
the O
patient O
wants O
their O
meds O
at O
a O
new O
pharmacy O
have O
the O
MD O
cancel O
the O
original O
rx O
and O
send O
a O
new O
one O
to O
the O
new O
pharmacy. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
just O
taken O
to O
faxing O
a O
reversal O
request. O
[SEP]
lol O
in O
patients' O
defense O
, O
thats O
alot O
of O
work O
even O
if O
its O
a O
dirt O
cheap O
medication. O
and O
then O
what O
happens O
when O
theyre O
waiting O
on O
something O
expensive O
like O
insulin? O
[SEP]
If O
it's O
not O
a O
control O
drug O
just O
pull O
the O
Wag O
A O
rx O
to O
wag O
B, O
then O
store O
it O
at O
Wag O
B. O
This O
will O
reverse O
the O
billing. O
You O
can't O
pull O
controls O
so O
if O
it's O
control O
you're O
still O
SOL O
[SEP]
Why O
wouldn’t O
you O
just O
transfer O
the O
drug O
and O
auto O
reverse O
the O
claim? O
That’s O
the O
entire O
point O
of O
the O
system O
at O
Walgreens. O
[SEP]
Even O
if O
it’s O
not O
part O
D O
insurance O
plans O
want O
to O
know O
about O
these O
access O
to O
care O
issues. O
If O
there O
are O
many O
of O
them O
we O
can O
audit O
all O
lines O
and O
start O
taking O
back O
claims O
they O
can’t O
prove O
were O
picked O
up O
but O
it O
doesn’t O
do O
anything O
in O
the O
moment. O
Us O
non-dispensing O
pharmacists O
out O
there O
feel O
for O
you!!! O
[SEP]
All O
it O
takes O
is O
data O
entry O
to O
get O
a O
paid O
claim O
and O
tie O
up O
the O
insurance. O
Will O
probably O
sit O
in O
a O
queue O
for O
4-5 O
days O
before O
actually O
ready O
for O
dispensing O
at O
a O
retail O
pharmacy O
that O
is O
understaffed O
[SEP]
This O
is O
true O
for O
every O
retail O
pharmacy, O
though… O
You O
type O
the O
Rx O
and O
get O
a O
tentative O
claim O
through O
their O
insurance. O
The O
claim O
isn’t O
billed O
to O
the O
patient O
until O
they O
pick O
up O
the O
Rx, O
but O
still O
ties O
up O
any O
more O
claims O
for O
that O
drug. O
This O
prevents O
duplicate O
claims, O
and O
is O
a O
form O
of O
preventing O
insurance O
fraud. O
[SEP]
Rite O
Aid O
floater O
here O
- O
am O
pretty O
new O
- O
so O
far O
I've O
not O
seen O
an O
automatic O
reversal O
feature O
that O
works O
externally O
(we O
have O
an O
internal O
feature O
that O
lets O
us O
pull O
things O
from O
other O
Rite O
Aids O
without O
having O
to O
call O
them O
to O
back O
it O
out O
- O
this O
doesn't O
work O
with O
other O
pharmacies), O
but O
the O
doctor O
can O
cancel O
prescriptions O
and O
it O
will O
show O
up O
in O
the O
pharmacist O
exception O
queue O
as O
a O
cancel O
request O
that O
we O
have O
to O
approve O
or O
deny, O
requiring O
immediate O
action O
(even O
if O
we're O
behind, O
that O
is O
extremely O
hard O
to O
ignore O
as O
most O
of O
the O
time O
there O
are O
only O
up O
to O
5 O
things O
in O
that O
queue). O
At O
the O
very O
least, O
if O
the O
pharmacy O
is O
open O
it O
won't O
be O
ignored O
for O
very O
long, O
and O
only O
requires O
their O
fingerprint O
to O
cancel O
the O
prescription. O
[SEP]
Yes O
they O
do, O
but O
if O
the O
prescriptions O
are O
in O
transition O
from O
one O
store O
to O
another, O
it O
may O
not O
work O
properly. O
I O
believe O
the O
prescriptions O
have O
to O
go O
through O
some O
system O
transition O
where O
they O
change O
from O
central O
to O
local O
at O
another O
store. O
The O
scripts O
should O
not O
be O
“stuck” O
as O
billed O
at O
the O
closed O
store O
for O
forever O
or O
even O
for O
more O
than O
the O
first O
couple O
days O
of O
the O
transition O
though. O
If O
the O
matter O
is O
about O
a O
maintenance O
medication, O
I O
would O
suggest O
waiting O
a O
few O
days O
for O
the O
dust O
to O
settle O
and O
then O
seeing O
if O
the O
pharmacist O
at O
that O
store O
can O
find O
the O
RX O
at O
that O
point. O
That O
store O
is O
probably O
also O
understaffed O
and O
now O
suddenly O
has O
to O
field O
100 O
extra O
calls O
about O
transfers. O
You O
can O
try O
a O
less O
busy O
store O
and O
see O
if O
that O
works. O
Or O
even O
just O
having O
the O
patient O
fill O
it O
one O
time O
at O
that O
pharmacy O
that O
received O
their O
prescription. O
[SEP]
No O
there O
is O
no O
auto O
reversal O
feature. O
When O
a O
Dr O
sends O
a O
cancel O
request O
it O
has O
to O
be O
manually O
acknowledged O
by O
the O
pharmacist O
on O
duty O
before O
it O
is O
reversed O
out O
of O
the O
system. O
If O
it O
is O
ready O
to O
be O
picked O
up O
at O
a O
Rite O
Aid, O
another O
one O
could O
pull O
it O
from O
their O
system O
and O
put O
it O
on O
hold O
at O
their O
new O
location. O
At O
that O
point O
an O
outside O
pharmacy O
could O
possibly O
bill O
for O
it O
no O
problem. O
But O
if O
something O
is O
"in O
process" O
at O
the O
original O
Rite O
Aid, O
meaning O
they O
billed O
the O
claim O
but O
maybe O
it O
is O
in O
Ready O
to O
Fill O
or O
needs O
the O
final O
pharmacist O
verification O
or O
something, O
even O
another O
Rite O
Aid O
can't O
pull O
it O
without O
contacting O
the O
first O
one O
to O
have O
them O
cancel O
it O
back. O
I've O
had O
this O
happen O
many O
times O
and O
it's O
a O
bitch O
to O
have O
to O
try O
calling O
the O
original O
store O
to O
tell O
them O
to O
back O
shit O
out O
before O
they O
fill O
it O
so O
we O
can. O
[SEP]
When O
we're O
they O
open O
on O
Thanksgiving? O
My O
walmart O
pharmacy O
has O
been O
closed O
on O
Thanksgiving O
the O
6 O
years O
I've O
been O
there. O
[SEP]
What O
state O
doesn’t O
require O
a O
pharmacy O
to O
transfer O
an O
RX O
at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
patient O
or O
patient’s O
agent? O
[SEP]
For O
Walgreens O
- O
just O
find O
an O
open O
store O
and O
if O
patient O
needs O
the O
Rx O
quickly O
- O
call O
and O
explain O
the O
circumstances. O
Have O
them O
pull O
the O
script O
over O
to O
that O
store O
and O
to O
put O
it O
on O
hold O
(as O
long O
as O
it’s O
not O
controlled O
or O
have O
a O
complicated O
billing). O
If O
the O
patient O
doesn’t O
need O
it O
immediately- O
fax O
over O
the O
transfer O
request O
and O
put O
a O
note O
on O
it. O

Another O
way O
is O

Haha O
I O
remember O
some O
RPh O
taught O
me O
this O
trick. O
It's O
ridiculous O
that O
it O
isn't O
more O
straight O
forward... O
[SEP]
not O
every O
retail O
pharmacy O
has O
automatic O
data O
entry O
before O
someone O
looks O
at O
it O
[SEP]
It's O
been O
several O
years O
and O
providers O
are O
still O
surprised O
when O
they O
send O
an O
eRx O
but O
the O
patient O
isn't O
able O
to O
pick O
it O
up. O
Thanksgiving O
would O
be O
so O
dead O
my O
PIC O
wouldn't O
schedule O
any O
Techs O
and O
pull O
the O
the O
shift O
himself. O
[SEP]
You're O
the O
one O
who O
made O
the O
claim O
to O
complain O
to O
the O
BoP, O
which O
insinuates O
it O
is O
a O
law/rule. O
What O
state O
are O
you O
in? O
Show O
me O
the O
state O
law O
or O
BoP O
ruling O
that O
states O
transferring O
a O
prescription O
is O
mandatory O
by O
law. O
Not O
how O
to O
do O
a O
transfer, O
but O
explicitly O
stating O
that O
transferring O
a O
prescription O
at O
a O
patient's O
request O
is O
mandated. O
[SEP]
The O
chains O
do O
now. O
Honestly O
it's O
great, O
takes O
away O
a O
lot O
of O
tedious O
work. O
[SEP]
I O
worked O
1 O

What O
a O
waste O

I'll O
always O
remember O
some O

shopping O

I O
had O
to O
check O
out O
70 O
something O

didn't O
care O
that O

will O
you O
name O
the O
state O
that O
you O
think O
doesn’t O
require O
it? O
[SEP]
Yup, O
love O
it. O
Probably O
half O
of O
our O
rx's O
at O
Walmart O
go O
straight O
past O
input. O
[SEP]
It O
all O
chains O
[SEP]
Right, O
you O
can O
vacuum, O
dust, O
and O
pull O
out O
of O
dates. O
Then O
what? O
You O
still O
have O
6 O
hours O
until O
you O
close. O
I O
would O
finish O
up O
my O
CEs O
for O
my O
cert O
then O
read O
a O
book. O
[SEP]
All O
of O
the O
rest, O
until O
someone O
shows O
me O
proof O
otherwise. O
Texas O
is O
the O
one O
I O
knew O
off O
hand O
does O
make O
it O
mandatory O
and O
has O
a O
time O
limit. O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
strange O
too, O
but O
I've O
researched O
tons O
of O
BoP O
complaints O
and O
had O
inspectors O
confirm O
it O
for O
me. O
[SEP]
That O
you O
won’t O
name O
a O
specific O
state O
is O
putting O
serious O
strain O
on O
your O
credibility. O
[SEP]
NJ O
requires O
immediate O
compliance O
[SEP]
Again, O
*I* O
am O
not O
the O
one O
making O
the O
claim, O
*you* O
are. O
So O
unless O
you O
want O
to O
post O
links O
for O
the O
other O
49 O
states, O
your O
claim O
is O
unfounded. O
Unless O
OP's O
state O
has O
a O
regulation O
making O
it O
mandatory O
to O
transfer O
a O
script, O
the O
BOP O
has O
no O
teeth O
to O
do O
anything, O
so O
complaining O
to O
them O
does O
nothing O
but O
waste O
everyone's O
time. O
[SEP]
So, O
you’re O
actually O
just O
wrong O
and O
now O
you’re O
moving O
goal O
posts. O
You O
asked O
me O
for O
1 O
example. O
I O
gave O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
it’s O
your O
turn O
to O
own O
up. O
YOU O
are O
the O
one O
asserting O
that O
in O
49 O
states O
transfers O
are O
a O
courtesy O
and O
not O
mandatory. O
You’re O
full O
of O
shit O
unless O
you O
will O
go O
on O
record O
stating O
a O
specific O
state O
where O
this O
is O
true. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Otherwise O
you O
are O
just O

a O

anything O

is O
a O

[SEP]
The O
effects O
of O
progesterone O
vary, O
both O
physical O
and O
mental. O
Physical, O
it O
affects O
fat O
distribution, O
though O
the O
kinds O
and O
levels O
of O
effect O
vary, O
but O
many O
do O
like O
what O
it O
does. O
It O
does O
indeed O
affect O
libido O
for O
some. O
For O
some, O
it O
gives O
them O
more O
energy O
(but O
also O
sometimes O
needing O
more O
sleep). O
Mentally, O
the O
effects O
are O
all O
over O
the O
place, O
with O
some O
reacting O
very O
well O
to O
it O
and O
it O
being O
the O
best O
thing O
since O
sliced O
bread O
and O
others O
absolutely O
hating O
it, O
and O
everywhere O
in O
between. O
For O
me, O
it O
is O
an O
extremely O
strong O
anti-dissociative O
(mostly O
a O
good O
thing) O
and O
the O
physical O
affects O
have O
been O
rather O
mild O
but O
still O
nice O
subtle O
changes. O
[SEP]
The O
short O
answer O
is O
that O
medical O
science O
doesn't O
know O
exactly O
what, O
if O
anything, O
it O
does O
for O
transfemme O
people. O
There O
are O
anecdotal O
reports O
that O
it O
helps O
with/helps O
complete O
breast O
development, O
that O
it O
helps O
with O
feminine O
fat O
distribution, O
that O
it O
increases O
libido O
that's O
been O
lost O
as O
a O
result O
of O
E O
and O
antiandrogens, O
that O
it O
can O
have O
positive O
mental O
health O
effects, O
positive O
effects O
on O
sleep, O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
other O
effects O
that O
people O
list, O
but O
that's O
all O
anecdotal. O
It's O
really O
up O
to O
you O
whether O
you O
think O
that O
anecdotal O
evidence O
is O
sufficient O
to O
be O
worth O
trying O
it. O
Personally O
I O
tried O
it, O
had O
bad O
side O
effects, O
and O
stopped; O
my O
sister O
tried O
it, O
saw O
very O
positive O
mental O
health O
effects O
and O
no O
side O
effects, O
and O
has O
stayed O
on O
it. O
[SEP]
Best O
I O
can O
tell, O
we O
have O
no O
freaking O
clue. O
Some O
say O
it O
helped O
feminization, O
some O
say O
it O
hurt, O
some O
say O
it O
did O
nothing. O
Some O
say O
it O
should O
be O
started O
after O
a O
year, O
some O
at O
tanner O
3, O
some O
never. O
It O
definitely O
shows O
up O
in O
cis O
girls O
puberty, O
but O
science O
isn't O
exactly O
sure O
WHY. O
With O
so O
much O
anecdotal O
evidence, O
and O
a O
near O
complete O
lack O
of O
scientific O
basis O
(even O
among O
the O
extremely O
undeveloped O
field O
of O
trans O
science), O
its O
up O
to O
you O
if O
you O
wanna O
talk O
to O
your O
doc O
about O
it. O
I'm B-Health
still I-Health
new I-Health
to I-Health
HRT I-Health
(only B-Time
5 I-Time
mos) I-Time
so O
I O
of O
course O
have O
no O
first O
hand O
experience O
with O
it O
myself. O
[SEP]
I’ve O
been O
on O
it O
for O

My O

my O

but O
I O
can’t O
really O
say O
with O
absolute O
certainty O
that O
any O
of O
that O
wouldn’t O
have O
happened O
as O
a O
result O
of O

and O

alone. O
That’s O
the O

The O
small-ish O

be O
extracted O
from O
said O

left O
us O
mostly O
in O

The O
answer O
is, O
as O
bad O
as O
cis O
female O

minority O
science O
is, O
trans O
science O
is O
worse. O
Basically, O
white O

medical O

wants O
moola, O
so O
white O
men O
get O
the O
science. O

why O
these O

have O
formed, O

what O
makes O
this O
whole O

so O
tough O
for O
a O

If O

The O
only O
thing O
we O
all O

for O
sure, O
is O
that O
you O
can O
look O
up O
cis O
female O
hormone O
timelines O
all O
over O
the O
internet. O
Progesterone O
comes O
into O
the O
female O
body O
something O
like O
tanner3 O
to O
tanner4, O
as O
menstruation O
begins, O
increases O
over O
time O
until O
a O
steady O
state, O
and O
then O
spikes O
as O
women O
get O
pregnant. O
Some O
say O
that O
female O
breasts O
don't O
come O
into O
full O
maturity O
until O
pregnancy, O
where O
they O
generally O
swell O
in O
preparation O
for O
feeding O
babies. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
this O
idealized, O
compressed O
cis-female O
schedule, O
where O
somewhere O
between O
recognizing O
tanner O
3 O
and O
tanner O
4 O
starts, O
introduce O
small O
amounts O
of O
cycling O
progesterone, O

I O

the O

are O
best O
for O

and O
obviously O
they O
aren't O
taking O
me. O
For O
clarification, O
I O
think O
I'd O
just O
like O
to O
apply O
to O
maybe O
5 O
schools O
just O
to O
see O
what O
happens, O
but O
most O
likely O
will O
delay O
for O
a O

really O
pump O
up O
that O

I O
think O
with O
some O
intense O

I O
could O
have O
a O

Who O
are O
some O
decent O

who O
may O

I’d O

I O
figured O
I’d O

move O

[SEP]

I O
know O
I O
can O
go O
on O

buy O
a O

for O
a O

of O

I’d O
like O
to O
do O
my O

with O
my O

[SEP]

I O

like O
to O

I O
can O
access O

that O
I O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Maybe O
this O
isn’t O
the O
correct O
place O
to O

for O
something O

I O
thought O
I’d O
start O
at O

and O
go O
from O
there. O
[SEP]
Buy O
a O
Glock O

and O
do O
it O
right, O
then O
branch O
out O
from O
there. O
Are O
you O
really O
considering O
experimenting O
with O
customer O
guns? O
[SEP]
Well, O
there's O
3D O
models O
and O
some O
website O
that O
does O
handgun O
comparisons. O
I O
think O
it O
has O
images O
with O
dimensions. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
can't O
find O
the O
dimensions, O
start O
out O
with O
glock O
and O
hit O
the O
other O
big O
name O
flagship O
pistols O
like O
the O
sig O
p320 O
and O
S&W O
m&p O
2.0. O
If O
you O
need O
the O
gun O
you O
could O
buy O
used O
on O
the O
cheap. O
Even O
LEO O
trade O
in's O
can O
be O
pretty O
cheap O
depending O
on O
how O
worn O
it O
is. O
If O
you O
only O
need O
the O
shape O
and O
not O
the O
function O
it O
should O
work. O
[SEP]
https://www.handgunhero.com/ O
[SEP]
Absolutely O
not! O
That O
would O
be O
a O
very O
expensive O
experiment! O
I O
have O
ran O
this O
business O
for O
many O
years O
an O
am O
very O
familiar O
with O
engraving O
different O
materials O
but O
in O
this O
case O
it’s O
more O
or O
less O
having O
10 O
- O
20 O
of O
the O
top O
handgun O
templates O
ready O
to O
rock O
so O
if O
a O
customer O
comes O
in O
with O
one O
of O
the O
handguns O
I O
already O
have O
a O
template O
for, O
I O
don’t O
have O
to O
spend O
an O
hour O
or O
more O
making O
a O
template, O
I O
can O
just O
swap O
the O
artwork O
to O
what O
they O
want O
and O
go. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
other O
idea O
was O
to O
sell O
the O
templates O
on O
the O
side O
for O
other O
laser O
guys O
to O
use O
in O
their O
business. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
engraved O
a O
few O
Glock O
slides O
and O
already O
have O
a O
couple O
templates O
but O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
that O
don’t O
have O
a O
Glock O
so O
rather O
then O
buying O
slides O
for O
a O
bunch O
of O
different O
handguns, O
I O
figured O
I’d O
see O
if O
there O
we O
any O
image O
databases O
I O
could O
use O
to O
save O
some O
time O
and O
money O
making O
the O
templates. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you, O
I O
did O
look O
at O
them O
but O
3D O
is O
hard O
because O
you O
never O
know O
if O
the O
designer O
added O
something O
or O
took O
something O
away O
because O
they O
thought O
it O
looked O
better O
or O
didn’t O
render O
as O
well O
with O
it O
so O
3D O
is O
tough O
to O
trust O
in O
the O
accuracy. O
I O
can O
compare O
them O
to O
actual O
images O
but O
doing O
that O
for O
100 O
guns O
could O
be O
incredibly O
time O
consuming. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
did O
dawn O
on O
me O
that O
the O
pictures O
being O
dimensionally O
accurate O
isn’t O
really O
a O
problem O
as O
I O
can O
simply O
scale O
the O
template O
up O
or O
down O
accordingly. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Most O
important O
is O
that O
the O
images O
be O
flat O
profiles O
with O
the O
gun O
flat O
on O
a O
table O
and O
that O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
gun O
are O
the O
same. O
Other O
then O
that O
it’s O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
scaling O
the O
design O
which O
is O
very O
simple. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’ll O
probably O
just O
end O
up O
taking O
my O
own O
photos. O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
tips, O
I O
own O
a O

have O

one O
covered. O
I O
think O
I O
can O
at O
least O
get O
started O
with O
a O
google O
image O
trace O
and O
adjust O
when O

get O

it. O

When O
my B-Family

away I-Family
6 B-Time
years I-Time
ago I-Time
my B-Family
two I-Family
brothers I-Family

I I-Family
inherited I-Family

the O

us O

the O

our B-Family
oldest I-Family

said I-Family
he I-Family
couldn't I-Family
have I-Family
his I-Family
name I-Family
on I-Family
the I-Family

he I-Family

The O
lawyer's O
solution O
was O
to O
have O
A O
sign O
a O
quit O
claim O
deed O

the O
lawyer O
stressed O
that O
my O
other O
brother O

I O
had O
to O
compensate O
A O
with O
something O
of O
equal O
value O
to O
his O

the O

[SEP]
[SEP]
We B-Finance
were I-Finance
all I-Finance
broke I-Finance
at O
the O
time O
so O
I O
suggested O
that O
we O
could O
sign O
a O
document O
saying O
if O
we O
sold O
the O
house O
we'd O
give O
him O
one O
third O
but O
that O
we O
would O
need O
time O
to O
draft O
the O
document O
before O
A O
signed O
the O
quit O
claim O
deed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
turned O
out O
that O
A O
went O
to O
the O
lawyer O
and O
signed O
the O
quit O
claim O
deed O
before O
we O
could O
make O
any O
such O
document O
(he O
is O
kind O
of O
dick O
so O
we O
were O
trying O
to O
draft O
a O
document O
that O
wouldn't O
accidentally O
give O
him O
more O
power O
over O
us O
than O
he O
would O
have O
had O
as O
an O
equal O
home O
owner). O
We O
got O
distracted O
by O
my B-Family
estranged I-Family
dad I-Family
passing I-Family
away I-Family
and O
the O
busyness O
of O
daily O
life O
and O
we O
ultimately O
never O
drafted O
that O
document. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
it's O
5 O
years O
later O
and O
due O
to O
A's O
increasingly O
toxic O
behavior O
I O
threatened O
that O
if O
he O
didn't O
stop O
treating O
us O
like O
crap O
I O
would O
kick O
him O
out O
of O
the O

He O
countered O
that O
he O
would O
take O
me O
to O
court O
over O
the O
quit O
claim O
deed O
and O
force O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
house O

make O

no O
one O
had O
the O
house. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I've O
been O
doing O
my O
research O
and O
I O
plan O
on O
talking O
to O
a O
lawyer O
but O
since O
the O
quit O
claim O
was O
signed, O
notarized, O
and O
filed O
with O
the O
register O
of O
deeds O
over O
2 O
years O
ago O
and O
my O
mom's O
will O
and O
estate O
was O
also O
over O
2 O
years O
ago O
I'm O
almost O
positive O
that O
he O
can't O
do O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
What O
I O
was O
really O
hoping O
you O
folks O
could O
fill O
me O
in O
on O
is: O
was O
the O
lawyer O
correct O
when O
he O
said O
that O
A O
had O
to O
be O
compensated O
for O
giving O
up O
his O
share O
of O
the O
house O
or O
was O
he O
just O
passing O
his O
opinion O
of O
how O
we O
"needed O
to O
stick O
together" O
off O
as O
something O
we O
legally O
had O
to O
do? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Edit: O
The O
child O
support O
he O
owed O
was O
paid O
in O
the O
interim O
[SEP]
I'm O
not O
a O
lawyer, O
but O
I O
think O
what O
is O
going O
on O
here O
is O
pretty O
ugly. O
You O
may O
have O
some O
liability O
here. O

sounds O
like O

[SEP]

But O
I O
think O
you O
are O
in O
legal O
jeopardy O
here. O
The O
value O
of O
A's O

of O
the O
house O
should O
have O
gone O
to O
pay O
his O
child O

but O
instead O
you O
got O
it. O
This O
needs O
to O
be O
fixed. O
If O
that O
means O
selling O
the O
house, O
so O
be O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
should O
see O
a O
lawyer O
to O
see O
how O
you O
can O
pay O
this O
money O
back O
without O
criminal O
charges. O
Do O
this O
proactively O
will O
be O
much O
better O
for O
you O
than O
if O
the O
state O
comes O
after O
you O
for O
it. O
[SEP]
Edited O
post O
to O
reflect O
that O
A O
paid O
the O
child O
support O
in O
the O
years O
since. O
(He O
used O
the O
money O
from O
his O
dad's O
estate O
to O
pay O
it) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
will O
bring O
that O
up O
with O
a O
lawyer O
when O
I O
talk O
to O
them O
though. O
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
advice. O
[SEP]
That O
makes O
a O
huge O
difference, O
obviously. O
But O
what O
he O
(and O
you) O
did O
5 O
years O
ago O
could O
still O
be O
a O
criminal O
act. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
At O
this O
point O
you O
own O
the O
house. O
He O
does O
not. O
It's O
up O
to O
you O
as O
to O
what O
if O
anything O
you O
want O
to O
do O
about O
this. O
If O
he O
tries O
to O
go O
to O
court, O
he O
would O
have O
to O
argue O
that O
you O
promised O
(verbally) O
to O
help O
him O
commit O
fraud, O
and O
then O
failed O
to O
follow O
through O
on O
it. O
It's O
a O
bit O
like O
a O
drug O
dealer O
getting O
ripped O
off O
in O
a O
drug O
deal O
and O
then O
calling O
the O
police O
because O
someone O
stole O
their O
drugs. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Talking O
to O
a O
lawyer O
is O
a O
very O
good O
idea. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Edit: O
just O
rereading O
the O
whole O
post, O
there O
is O
no O
legal O
"obligation" O
for O
you O
to O
compensate O
your O
brother O
for O
his O
share O
of O
the O
house. O
Apart O
from O
the O
whole O
child O
support O
thing, O
it's O
perfectly O
legal O
for O
your O
brother O
to O
receive O
a O
share O
of O
the O
house O
as O
an O
inheritance, O
and O
then O
deed O
it O
to O
you O
as O
a O
gift. O
The O
issue O
in O
court O
would O
be O
what O
if O
anything O
the O
two O
of O
you O
agreed O
on O
at O
the O
time. O
[SEP]
Again, O
thank O
you O
very O
much. O
Due O
to O
the O
multifaceted O
nature O
of O
this O
issue O
I've O
been O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
kind O
of O
lawyer O
I O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
about O
this O
and O
this O
has O
narrowed O
it O
down O
considerably. O

Question O
for O
Vatsim O
controllers O
[SEP]
So B-Other
I I-Other
have I-Other
done I-Other
at I-Other
most I-Other
2 I-Other
or I-Other
3 I-Other
flights I-Other
on I-Other
Vat I-Other
sim I-Other
before, I-Other
but O
it's O
been O
a O
long O
while O
and O
want O
to O
get O
started O
again, O
had O
a O
question O
for O
controllers. O
Lately, O
I've O
been O
doing O
practice O
flights O
in O
the O
F-16 O
OR O
F/A-and O
mainly O
just O
like O
to O
cruise O
around. O
From O
what O
I O
remember, O
a O
flight O
has O
to O
be O
to O
a O
different O
airport O
than O
the O
one O
you O
took O
off O
from, O
but O
do O
you O
think O
controllers O
would O
mind O
if O
I O
did O
some O
back O
and O
forth O
patterns O
in O
the O
process? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
example, O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
flights O
consist O
of O
me O
taking O
from O
Edwards O
AFB O
and O
flying O
around O
in O
the O
restricted O
airspace. O
If O
I O
took O
off O
from O
Edwards O
and O
did O
that O
then O
landed O
at O
say O
Area O
51 O
do O
you O
think O
controllers O
would O
mind O
as O
long O
as O
I O
clearly O
stated O
my O
intentions. O
So O
it O
wouldn't O
be O
a O
direct O
flight O
and O
I O
could O
even O
provide O
a O
route O
to O
help O
to O
say O
I O
will O
be O
flying O
this O
specific O
pattern. O
[SEP]
There O
is O
no O
requirement O
that O
a O
flight O
has O
to O
go O
from O
point O
A O
to O
B, O
as O
long O
as O
you O
have O
a O
coherent O
flight O
plan O
and O
follow O
ATC O
instructions/basic O
regulations. O
If O
you're O
in O
uncontrolled O
airspace, O
you O
can O
basically O
do O
anything O
within O
the O
code O
of O
conduct. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I'm O
not O
sure O
how O
the O
airspace O
is O
structured O
around O
KEDW, O
but O
you O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
in O
contact O
with O
LA O
center. O
You O
can O
always O
ask O
the O
controller, O
but O
be O
prepared O
to O
operate O
within O
whatever O
clearance O
they O
give O
you. O
You O
should O
also O
respect O
that O
they're O
probably O
busy, O
and O
VATSIM O
isn't O
really O
the O
place O
to O
request O
a O
high O
speed O
pass O
over O
LAX O
during O
a O
Friday O
night. O
[SEP]
Thanks. O
I O
wouldn't O
request O
anything O
that O
crazy. O
I O
usually O
dont O
fly O
supersonic O
out O
side O
the O
proper O
airspace O
and O
in O
this O
instance O
make O
sure O
to O
request O
any O
high O
speeds. O
Usually O
I O
fly O
around O
M.85-90 O
so O
only O
slightly O
faster O
than O
airliners. O

have O

Probably O
not O
the O

option O
(about O
45 O

definitely O
the O

at O

[SEP]
“Scheduling O
an O
Uber” O
isn’t O
actually O
scheduling, O
unfortunately. O
It O
just O
sets O
a O
request O
ahead O
of O
time O
to O
be O
sent O
out O
around O
5-10 O
minutes O
before O
your O
desired O
ride O
time. O
Uber’s O
own O
website O
says O
not O
to O
rely O
on O
it, O
as O
it’s O
not O
a O
guaranteed O
ride. O
If O
no O
one O
is O
around O
to O
accept O
the O
request O
at O
that O

no O
one O
will O
come. O

all O

The O

thing O
you O
ever O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
is O
if O
you O
cut O
it O
too O
close O
and O
the O
driver O
cancels O
at O
the O
last O
second. O
You O
will O
still O
get O
another O

they O
will O
be O
10 O

I O
look O
around O
this O

and O
I O
see O
too O
much O
loneliness. O
In O
truth: O
we O
are O
everyone; O
alone. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
are O
born O
alone O
and O
we O
die O
alone, O
we O
all O
know O
this...but O
being O
"alone" O
and O
being O
"lonely" O
is O
not O
the O
same O
thing....we O
all O
know O
that, O
right? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
can O
feel O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Yeah. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
can O
be O
nice O
and O
perfectly O
fine O
to O
be O
alone...but O
when O
we O
after O
a O
while O
start O
feeling O
lonely, O
and O
even O
lonelier O
- O
our O
mind: O
our O
state O
of O
mind, O
it O
changes. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Many O
of O
us O
lack O
the O
tools O
to O
draw O
force O
and O
energy O
from O
that O
feeling O
of O
loneliness O
and O
it O
grows O
into O
a O
deeper O
feeling, O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
abandonment, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
phase O
on O
that O
interior O
journey O
that O
some O
of O
you O
are O
on, O
where O
I'd O
like O
you O
to O
find O
this O
space. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Breath, O
exist O
and O
begin O
a O
new O
journey O
right O
here, O
right O
now: O
a O
journey O
inwards, O
towards O
your O
inner O
true O
being, O
a O
journey O
where O
YOU O
are O
your O
own O
guide, O
guru O
&amp; O
devotee. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
journey O
that O
you O
are O
fully O
capable O
to O
make O
(even O
though O
it O
might O
not O
feel O
like O
it) O
and O
that O
will O
give O
you O
something O
that O
you O
might O
not O
yet O
have: O
true O
and O
genuine O
self-trust. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Self-trust O
is O
not O
self-confidence, O
in O
fact O
we O
don't O
need O
self-confidence. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Self-trust O
is O
not O
self-esteem, O
in O
fact O
we O
don't O
need O
self-esteem. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
What O
we O
need O
though O
is O
self-trust...when O
we O
have O
gained O
access O
to O
our O
own O
self-trust, O
no O
one O
can O
then O
take O
it O
away O
from O
us. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Self-esteem O
and O
self-confidence O
is O
fed O
from O
outside O
of O
you, O
whilst O
self-trust O
comes O
from O
within, O
it O
is O
something O
you O
yourself O
have O
already O

that O
you O
can O
gain O
full O
access O

simply O
by O

I O
am O
just O
putting O
down O
a O
few O
lines O
here O
rather O
spontaneously, O
so O
you O
will O
have O
something O
if O
and O
when O
you O
come O
here. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Please O
know O
that O
you O
can O
become O
your O
own O
best O
friend, O
your O
own O
best O
lover O
and O
your O
own O
best O
parent O
. O
We O
really O
do O
not O
"need" O
anyone O
else O
and O
it O
can O
actually O
be O
rather O
useless O
to O
"be O
with O
someone O
else" O
before O
we O
have O
"been O
with O
our O
true O
self". O
And O
this O
is O
because O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
connect O
with O
a O
partner O
or O
a O
spouse O
or O
another O
person O
and O
being O
only O
once O
we O
have O
found O
a O
true O
and O
direct O
connection O
with O
our O
self. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
This O
means O
that O
if O
we O
stay O
in O
a O
relation O
with O
someone O
that O
also O
"hasn't O
yet O
met O
him/her/themselves/etc", O
no O
one O
in O
that O
relationship O
is O
really O
connecting O
with O
the O
other. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Most O
people O
have O
these O
types O
of O
relationships, O
due O
to O
the O
misconception O
about O
loneliness O
and O
a O
misunderstanding O
of O
how O
"connection" O
really O
functions. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
are O
alone O
and O
feeling O
lonely, O
I'd O
like O
for O
you O
to O
know O
and O
draw O
wisdom O
from O
knowing O
that O
being O
in O
such O
a O
relationship O
with O
another O
individual O
and O
being O
is O
100% O
a O
waste O
of O
your O
precious O
time. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don't O
care O
if O
you O
are O
14 O
years O
old, O
44 O
years O
old, O
or O
84 O
years O
old O
- O
you O
do O
NOT O
want O
to O
invest O
in O
such O
a O
relationship. O
Especially O
when O
you O
instead O
have O
all O
the O
possibility O
to O
put O
all O
that O
time-investment O
within O
establishing O
a O
deep O
connection O
with O
your O
self. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
are O
more O
than O
gold O
worth O
because O
you O
have O
an O
intrinsic O
value O
for O
just O
being O

sure O
the O
short O

is O
that O
they O

a O

The O
perceived O
importance O

If O
you O
want O
to O
know O
the O

look O
at O
the O

that O

find O
that O

legislative O

It's O

I O

"obviously O

another O

"they're O

almost O
bought O
it O
before O
finding O
another O
one O
for O
$1500 O
both O
were O

never O
fired. O
I O
knew O
that O
was O
the O

it’s O
the O

just O
better O

why O

going O

it! O
I O
do O

1-2 O

Unless O
your O

I O
don’t O

they O

a O

If O

it O

[SEP]
Not O
entirely O

We O

that O

I O

[SEP]
I O
simply O
wanted O

if O
I O
could O
retort O
about O
the O

if O

beyond O
reason. O
[SEP]
I O
suppose O
you O
now O
rent O
and O
that O
can O
be O
a O
lower O
standard O
of O
living O
than O
home O
ownership O
that O
you O
once O
had O
during O
a O
portion O
of O
your O
marriage. O
Will O
you O
need O
to O
move O
to O
a O
cheaper O
apt? O
Whereas O
on O
a O
salary O
of O
250k O
he O
can O
much O
more O
easily O
get O
a O
house O
(or O
luxury O
apt O
)and O
build O
equity O
again. O
Doesn’t O
seem O
fair O
that O
you O
cant O
participate O
in O
this O
largesse. O
If O
you O
are O
older O
don’t O
rush O
to O
divorce O
or O
if O
you O
don’t O
like O
your O
job! O
Not O
sure O
if O
the O
split O
is O
mutual. O
He O
seems O
to O
have O
it O
easy, O
not O
working O
for O
years O
and O
then O
being O
able O
to O
secure O
a O
high O
salary O
job O
that O
is O
much O
higher O
than O
his O
previous O
salary. O
The O
much O
higher O
salary O
jump O
seems O
off O
to O
me. O
You O
are O
entitled O
to O
maintain O
your O
same O
standard O
of O
living O
as O
you O
had O
during O
the O
marriage O
- O
that’s O
where O
the O
spousal O
support O
comes O
in. O
Also O
if O
you O
have O
been O
married O
for O
10 O
years O
you O
are O
entitled O
to O
1/2 O
of O
his O
social O
security O
earned O
during O
your O
years O
of O
marriage O
if O
it’s O
higher O
than O
yours O
at O
retirement O
and O
if O
he O
passes O
before O
you, O
you O
get O
his O
full O
social O
security. O
That O
could O
come O
in O
handy O
in O
your O
later O
years O
if O
he O
earned O
more O
than O
you. O
Seems O
like O
to O
me O
if O
you O
wait O
until O
he O
actually O
secures O
his O
job O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
he’ll O
keep O
it O
you O
would O
be O
better O
off O
getting O
some O
spousal O
support. O
You O
must O
have O
good O
health O
care O
too. O
If O
he O
has O
a O
retirement O
plan O
from O
past O
employment O
during O
the O
marriage O
you O
would O
be O
entitled O
to O
share O
in O
that. O
VA O
is O
an O
equitable O
distribution O
state, O
so O
the O
Court O
would O
look O
at O
what O
is O
fair. O
That O
might O
be O
much O
more O
of O
the O
10k O
left O
for O
you O
from O
the O
property O
division. O
Its O
not O
50/50 O
like O
in O
a O

It’s O

edit: O
from O
what O
I O
can O
glean, O
NZ O
maps O
aren’t O
possible O
in O

default O
Nissan O

unit O
and O
it’s O
recommended O
to O
use O
Android O
or O
iPhone O
Car O
Play O
Instead O
for O
maps. O
[SEP]
If O
you've O
got O
carplay/android O
auto O
then O
use O
that. O
The O
car's O
built-in O
stuff O
is O
pretty O
garbage. O
Virtually O
none O

If O

I O
was O
hoping O
it O
could O
have O
more O

an O
NZ O

I’ll O
check O
with O
the O

too, O
if O
any O
NZ O

the O

90% O
sure O
you O

since O

it O
may O

an O

need O
to O
make O
it O
into O
a O
salt O
to O
be O
able O

snort O
it? O
As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
if O
it's O
free O
base O
you O
can O
only O
smoke O
it. O
I O
am O
skeptical O
boofing O
will O
work O
if O

didn't. O
I O

Snorting O
4-ho-met O
doesn't O
make O
it O
stronger. O
None O
of O
the O
psilocin O
analogues O
work O
better O
intranasally. O
Take O
it O
in O
a O
capsule O
or O
roll O
it O
in O
toilet O
paper O
and O
take O
a O
larger O
dose O
if O
it's O
not O
strong O
enough O
for O
you O
instead O
of O
trying O
other O
roas. O
Oral O
bioavailability O
is O
not O
an O
issue O
with O
these O
substances. O
A O
good O
rule O
of O
thumb O
is O
that O
1g O
of O
shrooms O
is O
10mg O
of O
psilocin, O
so O
45mg O
is O
not O
a O
super O
high O
dose O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
psilocin O
analogues. O
Especially O
considering O
that O
I've O
seen O
psilocin O
analogues O
at O
90% O
purity O
and O
there O
could O
be O
even O
worse O
batches O
than O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
would O
say, O
it's O
possible O
your O
issue O
is O
purity O
of O
the O
product, O
but O
Idk O
what O
kind O
of O
tolerance O
you O
have. O
The O
issue O
is O
not O
bioavailability. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
also O
don't O
know O
what O
you O
mean O
by O
mild. O
What O
effects O
are O
you O
looking O
for? O
I O
don't O
get O
a O
strong O
visual O
experience O
until O
I O
get O
close O
to O
70mg. O
[SEP]
I've O
never O
snorted O
it, O
but O
I've O
taken O
pretty O
high O
doses O
vaped/smoked, O
probably O
over O
100mg. O
No O
matter O
how O
hard O
I O
tried, O
it O
never O
got O
super O
deep. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
MET O
is O
one O
of O
those O
psychedelics O
you O
just O
have O
to O
enjoy O
it O
for O
what O
it O
is. O
A O
zenny O
tactile O
euphoric O
but O
mild O
psychedelic. O
[SEP]
Assume O
you're O
speaking O
of O
4-ho-met. O
Why O
snort O
it? O
Oral O
is O
more O
effective. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
reliable O
is O
your O
source O
and O
how O
positive O
are O
you O
that O
it O
was O
45mg's? O
I O
can O
promise O
you O
that O
an O
accurately O
weighed O
45mg O
dose O
of O
good O
metocin, O
even O
if O
snorted, O
would O
be O
one O
wild O
fucking O
ride. O
In O
fact, O
most O
people, O
including O
me, O
would O
think O
that O
45mg's O
is O
way O
too O
much. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
did O
just O
25mg's O
and O
was O
pretty O
surprised O
at O
how O
intense O
it O
was O
at O
times. O
[SEP]
Some O
mental O
relaxation, O
feeling O
calm, O
and O
bit O
sleepy. O
There O
was O
some O
bodyfeel, O
the O
bodyfeel O
was O
kinda O
is O
kinda O
nice O
and O
was O
the O
nicest O
part O
of O
it, O
but O
it O
was O
also O
moderate O
at O
best, O
and O
only O
for O
short. O
Almost O
no O
visuals O
apart O
from O
a O
bit O
brighter O
colours O
and O
very, O
very O
mild O
psychedelic O
overly O
over O
everything. O
When O
it O
comes O
to O
side O
effects, O
it O
just O
made O
me O
a O
bit O
jittery, O
but O
apart O
from O
that O
pretty O
much O
none, O
not O
even O
nausea. O
Can't O
forget O
about O
the O
smell O
tho, O
that O
was O
the O
biggest O
side O
effect O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
is O
it O
for O
you? O
And O
how O
much O
do O
you O
snort? O
[SEP]
It's O
not O
freebase, O
i O
wouldn't O
snort O
freebase. O
It's O
fumarate. O
Or O
at O
least O
it O
was O
sold O
as O
such... O
[SEP]
I O
am O
skeptical O
about O
boofing O
too. O
[SEP]
Idk O
either, O
but O
snorting O
it O
is O
as O
if O
a O
dead O
fish O
shit O
in O
your O
face O
[SEP]
\#BOOFSQUAD O
HEAR O

[SEP]
Iam O
not O
talking O
about O
4-HO-MET, O
that O
i O
only O
boof, O
works O
the O
best O
that O
way O
imo, O
saves O
a O
lot O
of O
material O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
talking O
about O
MET, O
the O
unsubstituted O
variant, O
related O
to O
DMT. O
Orally O
you O
need O
a O
load O
of O
that, O
like O
120-150mg O
according O
to O
psychonaut, O
if O
i O
remember O
correctly. O
That's O
why O
I O
want O
a O
way O
which O
requires O
less O
material O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
no O
tolerance, O
i O
haven't O
done O
psychedelics O
in O
a O
while. O
It O
might O
be O
purity, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
anymore, O
considering O
someone O
else O
also O
reported O
to O
be O
this O
way O
nasally, O
and O
that O
it O
has O
to O
be O
smoked O
for O
stronger O
effects. O
But O
the O
smell O
is O
really O
fucking O
off-putting O
[SEP]
[SEP]
By O
mild O
i O
mean O
no O
visuals O
apart O
from O
brighter O
colours, O
headspace O
consisting O
only O
of O
inner-peace O
and O
very O
mild O
euphoria/mood O
lift O
and O
mild O
bodyfeel O
(warmness, O
mild O
numbness, O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
tingling, O
feeling O
comfy) O
[SEP]
Okay, O
that's O
kinda O
surprising. O
Good O
to O
know. O
[SEP]
How O
intense O
does O
it O
get O
when O
vaped? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Yeah, O
makes O
sense. O
I O
mean, O
it's O
good, O
just O
not O
what O
I O
expected. O
I O
still O
like O
it O
[SEP]
Nope, O
I O
mean O
MET, O
the O
unsubstituted O
DMT O
relative O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also, O
with O
4-HO-MET, O
i O
would O
recommend O
boofing, O
it's O
considerably O
more O
potent O
than O
oral O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
source O
is O
pretty O
reliable O
and O
i O
weighted O
it O
myself O
with O
a O
pretty O
decent O
scale. O
[SEP]
With O
metocin O
i O
would O
be O
in O
another O
universe O
with O
that O
dose O
lol O
[SEP]
at O
doses O
of O
25-30 O
mg O
i O
get O
some O
nice O
mild O
visuals O
relaxation O
euphoria O
and O
mood O
boost O
i O
used O
these O
doses O
to O
go O
out O
in O
nature O
and O
just O
appreciate O
nature O
more O
i O
wasn’t O
really O
tripping, O
vaped O
the O
visuals O
get O
a O
lot O
stronger O
and O
it O
gets O
trippy O
i O
feel O
like O
snorted O
could O
be O
more O
recreational O
[SEP]
Maybe O
it's O
just O
bad O
quality O
then. O
Boofing O
should O
be O
stronger O
than O
snorting, O
and O
unless O
it O
hurt O
snorting O
it O
shouldn't O
hurt O
either O
when O
boofing. O
So O
maybe O
it's O
a O
better O
way O
but O
probably O
still O
not O
gonna O
be O
anything O
great. O
[SEP]
Ahh, O
sorry. O
Idk O
why O
I O
missed O
that. O
I O
can't O
help O
you O
with O
that. O
[SEP]
Boofing O
is O
life. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
fumarate O
tryptamines O
provide O
relatively O
little O
added O
value O
when O
snorted O
or O
boofed. O
Boofing O
in O
excess O
can O
also O
cause O
some O
legg O
blood O
vein O
damage. O
[SEP]
I'm O
trying O
to O
tell O
you O
it O
never O
really O
gets O
intense, O
maybe O
if O
you O
IV O
it O
but O
fuck O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I've O
put O
mine O
away O
for O
a O
while O
but O
next O
time O
I O
explore O
it O
I'll O
use O
in O
conjunction O
with O
psilocin O
or O
DMT. O
[SEP]
Me O
too, O
it's O
good, O
it O
just O
doesnt O
have O
the O
kick O
that O
some O
do O
[SEP]
Makes O
sense, O
i O
can O
see O
that. O
Maybe O
it's O
just O
different O
than O
i O
expected, O
as O
from O
what O
you're O
saying, O
the O
effects O
i O
got O
don't O
seem O
too O
far O
off. O
I O
just O
expected O
it O
more O
intense. O
I O
wasn't O
really O
tripping O
either, O
while O
I O
did O
expect O
a O
trip. O
And O
i O
mean, O
it O
was O
nice, O
don't O
get O
me O
wrong O
there O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
can O
you O
was O
it? O
The O
smell O
is O
awful O
already O
when O
I O
snort O
it, O
and O
if O
I O
had O
to O
vape O
it... O
Ew O
[SEP]
Also, O
how O
easy O
is O
it O
to O
vape, O
is O
it O
pain O
in O
the O
ass O
like O
DMT? O
[SEP]
That's O
also O
possible. O
Who O
knows. O
It O
hurts O
a O
little O
snorted, O
but O
compared O
to O
other O
shit O
it's O
fine. O
It O
shouldn't O
be O
a O
problem O
boofed. O
I'll O
try O
boofing O
some O
other O
time... O
[SEP]
I O
figured, O
i O
mean, O
if O
it's O
like O
this O
snorted, O
it's O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
that O
much O
better O
boofed, O
but O
still O
worth O
the O
try O
i O
guess. O
Even O
the O
effects O
from O
it O
are O
very O
meh O
[SEP]
No O
worries, O
happens O
[SEP]
Indeed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
does, O
it O
lowers O
the O
dosage O
needed O
tremendously O
[SEP]
Okay, O
i O
must O
have O
misunderstood O
you O
[SEP]
Fuck O
iv O
indeed O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
combo O
sounds O
pretty O
good O
[SEP]
Exactly O
[SEP]
its O
not O
super O
difficult O
to O
vape O
actually O
i O
didn’t O
mind O
the O
taste O
while O
snorting O
and O
vaping O
its O
completely O
fine O
for O
me. O
I B-Other
actually I-Other
like I-Other
the I-Other
effects I-Other
a I-Other
lot I-Other
of I-Other
MET I-Other
it O
grants O
me O
somewhat O
of O
an O
„inner-peace“ O
feeling O
[SEP]
For O
sure. O
I O
am O
curious O
how O
it O
will O
turn O
out. O
Maybe O
MET O
is O
not O
a O
very O
good O
drug O
either. O
Its O
analogous O
compound O
4-HO-MET O
is O
much O
more O
popular O
for O
some O
reason O
haha O
[SEP]
How O
do O
you O
vape O
it, O
with O
what O
method? O
[SEP]
You O
probably O
have O
a O
different, O
better O
batch. O
For O
me O
the O
smell O
is O
very O
much O
not O
okay, O
as O
I O
said, O
it O
smells O
like O
dead O
fish O
shit. O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
i O
like O
that O
too, O
it O
was O
probably O
the O
nicest O
part O
of O
it. O
In O
kinda O
similar O
fashion O
to O
DMT, O
but O
not O
nearly O
as O
strong. O
[SEP]
Looking O
bad, O
it O
was O
actually O
kinda O
good, O
just O
not O
as O
strong O
as O
i O
would O
expect O
[SEP]
Kam O
curious O
too. O
[SEP]
I O
wouldn't O
say O
that O
it's O
bad, O
it O
feels O
good, O
it's O
nice, O
but O
it's O
so O
mild, O
it's O
not O
even O
a O
trip. O
But O
someone O
else O
said O
that O
they O
experience O
something O
similar O
to O
that, O
so O
maybe O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
that O
way O
when O
snorted. O
[SEP]
It O
should O
be O
lit O
more O
intense O
when O
vaped, O
but O
i O
can't O
imagine O
vaping O
that O
putrid O
smelling O
shit. O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
and O
i O
can O
see O
why, O
4-HO-MET O
is O
great. O
One O
of O
my O
favorites O
psychedelics O
[SEP]
i O
even O
vaped O
the O
fumarate O
salt O
just O
put O
it O
in O
a O
oil O
burner O
and O
hit O
it O
[SEP]
Okay, O
cool, O
I'll O
try O
that, O
thanks O
[SEP]
just O
increase O
the O
dose O
too O
MET O
seems O
rather O
forgiving O
like O
it’s O
4-HO O
brother O
does O
too O
[SEP]
I O
would O
increase O
the O
dose O
snorted, O
but O
i O
don't O
have O
much O
of O
it O
and O
don't O
want O
to O
use O
up O
half O
of O
it O
one O
one O
trip, O
so... O
Yeah. O
Glad O
to O
hear O
that O
it's O
so O
forgiving. O

[SEP]
I O
(16F) B-Age_Gender
and O
my O
cousin O
(15F) B-Age_Gender
are O
best O
friends, O
even O
close O
to O
sisters, O
and O
we O
recently O
went O
to O
visit O
her O
before O
she O
moved O
cities. O
The O
city O
she O
lives O
in O
now O
is O
really O
far O
from O
where O
we O
live, O
so O
we O
visited O
to O
say O
goodbye O
to O
her O
and O
her O
little O
brother, O
let’s O
call O
him O
Trevor. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
Trevor’s O
first O
language O
isn’t O
English O
and O
he O
learned O
English O
through O
me O
and O
my B-Family
older I-Family
sister I-Family
who I-Family
used I-Family
to I-Family
live I-Family
abroad I-Family
and O
mostly O
from O
these O
very O
cringey O
YouTubers O
that O
neither O
me O
nor O
my O
best O
friend O
like. O
Let’s O
just O
say O
they O
aren’t O
the O
best O
examples O
for O
little O
kids. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
little O
brother O
(10M) B-Age_Gender
is O
my O
pride O
and O
joy O
and O
I O
love O
him O
more O
than O
I O
love O
anything O
else O
in O
the O
world, O
so O
while O
my O
parents O
were O
out O
for O
vacation O
they O
put O
me O
and O
my O
siblings O
in O
the O
care O
of O
my B-Family
uncle I-Family
(a I-Family
doctor) I-Family
my I-Family
grandfather I-Family
(retired I-Family
nurse) I-Family
and O
we O
also O
had O
a O
caretaker O
for O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
been O
with O
us O
for O
four O
years, O
so O
we’re O
doing O
fine. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
here’s O
where O
I O
might O
be O
an O
asshole. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
night O
before O
they O
left, O
my O
brother O
got O
frustrated O
that O
the O
Wi-Fi O
was O
gone O
(we’d O
been O
using O
their O
Wi-Fi O
and O
they O
had O
packed O
it O
up) O
and O
my O
other O
brother O
(16M B-Age_Gender
cerebral B-Health
palsy) I-Health
was O
screaming O
for O
the O
same O
reason. O
My O
little O
brother O
got O
overstimulated O
quickly O
because O
along O
with O
the O
screaming, O
Trevor O
was O
playing O
one O
of O
his O
offline O
games O
and O
raging O
at O
losing O
against O
the O
computer. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
At O
first O
I O
tried O
asking O
Trevor O
to O
turn O
down O
the O
volume, O
and O
explained O
to O
him O
that O
since O
my B-Family
little I-Family
brother I-Family
was I-Family
autistic, I-Family
loud O
noises O
really O
made O
him O
upset. O
Trevor O
agreed O
at O
first, O
but O
quickly O
went O
back O
to O
hurling O
curses O
at O
his O
IPad. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
caretaker O
was O
trying O
to O
help O
as O
best O
she O
could O
to O
her O
credit, O
and O
my O
sister O
was O
trying O
to O
calm O
down O
our O
other O
brother. O
Meanwhile O
Trevor O
was O
making O
these O
monkey O
sounds O
that O
sounded O
like O
he O
was O
mocking O
my O
brother O
who O
was O
at O
the O
time O
curled O
up O
with O
me, O
covering O
his O
ears. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
told O
Trevor O
a O
second O
time, O
more O
forcefully O
to O
please O
stop O
because O
it O
really O
wasn’t O
helping O
the O
situation O
and O
he O
told O
me O
it O
wasn’t O
his O
fault O
my O
brother O
was O
upset. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
tried O
telling O
him O
again O
that O
my B-Family
brother I-Family
was I-Family
special I-Family
needs I-Family
and O
he O
needed O
quiet, O
to O
which O
my O
cousin O
told O
me O
her O
brother O
knows O
that O
but O
he O
can’t O
be O
blamed O

I O
(16F) B-Age_Gender
and O
my O
cousin O
(15F) B-Age_Gender
are O
best O
friends, O
even O
close O
to O
sisters, O
and O
we O
recently O
went O
to O
visit O
her O
before O
she O
moved O
cities. O
The O
city O
she O
lives O
in O
now O
is O
really O
far O
from O
where O
we O
live, O
so O
we O
visited O
to O
say O
goodbye O
to O
her O
and O
her O
little O
brother, O
let’s O
call O
him O
Trevor. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
Trevor’s O
first O
language O
isn’t O
English O
and O
he O
learned O
English O
through O
me O
and O
my B-Family
older I-Family
sister I-Family
who I-Family
used I-Family
to I-Family
live I-Family
abroad I-Family
and O
mostly O
from O
these O
very O
cringey O
YouTubers O
that O
neither O
me O
nor O
my O
best O
friend O
like. O
Let’s O
just O
say O
they O
aren’t O
the O
best O
examples O
for O
little O
kids. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
little O
brother O
(10M) B-Age_Gender
is O
my O
pride O
and O
joy O
and O
I O
love O
him O
more O
than O
I O
love O
anything O
else O
in O
the O
world, O
so O
while O
my O
parents O
were O
out O
for O
vacation O
they O
put O
me O
and O
my O
siblings O
in O
the O
care O
of O
my O
uncle O
(a O
doctor) O
my O
grandfather O
(retired O
nurse) O
and O
we O
also O
had O
a O
caretaker O
for O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
been O
with O
us O
for O
four O
years, O
so O
we’re O
doing O
fine. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
here’s O
where O
I O
might O
be O
an O
asshole. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
night O
before O
they O
left, O
my O
brother O
got O
frustrated O
that O
the O
Wi-Fi O
was O
gone O
(we’d O
been O
using O
their O
Wi-Fi O
and O
they O
had O
packed O
it O
up) O
and O
my O
other O
brother O
(16M B-Age_Gender
cerebral B-Health
palsy) I-Health
was O
screaming O
for O
the O
same O
reason. O
My O
little O
brother O
got O
overstimulated O
quickly O
because O
along O
with O
the O
screaming, O
Trevor O
was O
playing O
one O
of O
his O
offline O
games O
and O
raging O
at O
losing O
against O
the O
computer. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
At O
first O
I O
tried O
asking O
Trevor O
to O
turn O
down O
the O
volume, O
and O
explained O
to O
him O
that O
since O
my B-Family
little I-Family
brother I-Family
was I-Family
autistic, I-Family
loud O
noises O
really O
made O
him O
upset. O
Trevor O
agreed O
at O
first, O
but O
quickly O
went O
back O
to O
hurling O
curses O
at O
his O
IPad. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
caretaker O
was O
trying O
to O
help O
as O
best O
she O
could O
to O
her O
credit, O
and O
my O
sister O
was O
trying O
to O
calm O
down O
our O
other O
brother. O
Meanwhile O
Trevor O
was O
making O
these O
monkey O
sounds O
that O
sounded O
like O
he O
was O
mocking O
my O
brother O
who O
was O
at O
the O
time O
curled O
up O
with O
me, O
covering O
his O
ears. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
told O
Trevor O
a O
second O
time, O
more O
forcefully O
to O
please O
stop O
because O
it O
really O
wasn’t O
helping O
the O
situation O
and O
he O
told O
me O
it O
wasn’t O
his O
fault O
my O
brother O
was O
upset. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
tried O
telling O
him O
again O
that O
my B-Family
brother I-Family
was I-Family
special I-Family
needs I-Family
and O
he O
needed O
quiet, O
to O
which O
my O
cousin O
told O
me O
her O
brother O
knows O
that O
but O
he O
can’t O
be O
blamed O
for O
my O
brother’s O
meltdowns. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
To O
her O
credit, O
she O
also O
asked O
Trevor O
to O
either O
stop O

that O
I've O
seen O
recommended O
here O
goes O
out O
the O
window. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
no O
other O
advice O
to O
offer O
other O
than O
what O
worked O
for O
me. O
I O
have O
a O
pretty O
checkered O
past O
(that's O
the O
most O
I'm O
willing O
to O
say O
on O
my O
main), O
but O
most O
everything O
but O
some O
financial O
wreckage O
was O
almost O
3 O
years O
in O
the O
past O
when O
I O
went O
through O
a O
public O
trust O
background O
check. O
Different O
animal, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
same O
principles O
apply: O
be O
completely O
honest. O
Don't O
even O
try O
to O
act O
like O
you're O
hiding O
anything O
or O
try O
to O
sugarcoat O
it. O
That O
got O
me O
through. O
I've O
never O
been O
military, O
so O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
penalties O
(beyond O
being O
denied O
a O
clearance) O
you O
might O
or O
might O
not O
be O
facing. O
If O
you O
haven't O
actually O
enlisted O
yet, O
it O
would O
probably O
be O
better O
than O
if O
you O
have. O
If O
you O
can O
still O
back O
out, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
consider O
it. O
That's O
what O
I'd O
do, O
but O
that's O
total O
gut O
reaction O
based O
on O
nothing O
other O
than O
a O
strong O
sense O
of O
self-preservation. O

the O

I O
had O
hard O
time O

it. O
They O
have O
made O
a O

so O
I'd O

I O
have O
also O
tried O
HEALTH, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
vocals O
are O
too O
anonymous O
and O
monotone O
which O
is O
a O
damn O
shame, O
because O
the O
instrumentals O
are O

superb. O

realize O
it's O
a O

outside O
of O
the O
normal O
X O
physique O
bodybuilders O
go O
for, O
but O
I O
hoped O
it'd O
still O
fit O
since O
I'm O
building O
a O

What O
weak O
bodyparts O
would O
you O
think O
I O
have O
here? O
It's O
from O
this O

I O
want O
to O
particularly O
build O

more O

### O
Program O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
took O
inspiration O
from O
both O
Alex O
and O
Jeff O
in O
making O
the O
routine O
I O
laid O
out O
below. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
went O
with O
a O
torso O
/ O
limb O
split O
since O
that O
allowed O
me O
more O
easily O
to O
allocate O
the O
upper O
body O
volume. O
It's O
basically O
an O
upper O
/ O
lower O
split, O
just O
with O
arm O
work O
on O
leg O
days. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Some O
will O
notice O
the O
leg O
volume O
is O
a O
bit O
lacking, O
I O
started O
low O
on O
purpose, O
because O
I'm O
doing O
a O
bit O
of O
endurance O
work O
on O
the O
side. O
I O
bike O
60 O
minutes O
to O
and O
from O
work O
every O
day O
and O
I O
run O
4 O
times O
per O
week O
and O
hike O
in O
the O
weekend. O
Beyond O
that O
I O
think O
it's O
my O
upper O
body O
that O
needs O
the O
most O
work O
in O
either O
case. O

Thought O
you O
were O
a O
novice O
or O
something O
honestly O
from O
the O
piece O
of O
the O
pic O
shown O
above O
in O
the O
post, O
then O
I O
saw O
your O
lower O
body O
and O
other O
pics.. O
your O
calves O
are O
absolutely O
massive O
very O
impressive.. O
is O
it O
genetics, O
or O
do O
you O
have O
the O
best O
calve O
training O
routine O
in O
history? O
I’d O
love O
to O
know O
what O
you O
do O
for O
them, O
you O
seem O
to O
be O
lower O
body O
dominant O
so O
getting O
yoked O
will O
truly O
round O
you O
out O
imo O
[SEP]
Program O
looks O
solid O
bro, O
run O
it O
and O
keep O
us O
posted O
with O
your O
progress! O
[SEP]
Your O
legs O
are O
looking O
good, O
so O
is O
your O
arms O
and O
delts. O
Middle O
back O
is O
ok O
but O
your O
chest O
and O
lats O
are O
lacking. O
What O
grip O
do O
you O
do O
your O
pull O
ups O
with? O
It O
could O
also O
be O
a O
form O
issue O
for O
why O
you're O
not O
developing O
those O
areas O
more. O
Are O
you O
using O
full O
ROM O
and O
getting O
a O
nice O
stretch O
on O
the O
pull O
ups O
and O
chest O
exercises? O
[SEP]
Your O
frequency O
isn't O
really O
mentioned, O
so O
I'll O
say O
this. O
Arguably O
the O
two O
most O
important O
muscle O
groups O
for O
developing O
the O
"yoked" O
look O
are O
the O
shoulders O
and O
upper O
back. O
Shoulders O
are O
definitely O
emphasized O
in O
your O
program, O
but O
due O
to O
how O
quickly O
shoulders O
recover, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
variables O
in O
training O
them O
is O
going O
to O
be O
frequency. O
Finding O
ways O
to O
increase O
delt O
frequency O
without O
compromising O
joint O
health O
can O
be O
key. O
For O
most O
guys, O
the O
upper O
back O
seems O
to O
be O
able O
to O
handle O
even O
more O
volume O
and O
frequency O
than O
even O
the O
shoulders, O
so O
(and O
again O
being O
mindful O
of O
joint O
health) O
it's O
super O
difficult O
to O
overtrain O
your O
upper O
back, O
and O
if O
we O
want O
it O
to O
grow O
maximally O
we O
should O
probably O
be O
training O
it O
with O
greater O
volume O
and O
frequency O
than O
most O
other O
bodyparts. O
I O
could O
give O
you O
some O
suggestions O
in O
this O
area O
from O
my O
own O
experience O
if O
you'd O
like. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
One O
thing O
I O
noticed O
looking O
at O
your O
pictures O
is O
that O
while O
your O
shoulders O
and O
arms O
do O
look O
pretty O
well O
developed O
already, O
your O
chest O
may O
be O
considered O
a O
weakpoint. O
The O
program O
you've O
written O
disproportionately O
focuses O
on O
upper O
chest O
and O
shoulders, O
but O
seems O
to O
neglect O
the O
greater O
portions O
of O
the O
chest O
which O
for O
most O
people O
are O
more O
receptive O
to O
growth. O
This O
shouldn't O
necessarily O
be O
a O
concern O
depending O
on O
the O
physique O
you're O
going O
for, O
but O
a O
big O
part O
of O
getting O
that O
thick, O
girthy O
look O
is O
developing O
a O
chest O
that O
projects O
away O
from O
your O
body, O
and O
this O
will O
be O
almost O
entirely O
lower O
and O
mid O
pec. O
Again, O
this O
is O
just O
goal O
specific O
so O
feel O
free O
to O
ignore O
[SEP]
Physique O
wise O
I'd O
say O
lats, O
rear O
delts, O
lower O
back, O
and O
neck O
could O
be O
better. O
Chest O
seems O
decent O
but O
you O
can O
never O
have O
too O
big O
of O
a O
chest O
imo. O

Noted. O
[SEP]
Either O
I'm O
shitty O
at O
working O
my O
upper O
body O
or O
my O
lower O
body O
has O
been O
more O
responsive, O
I've O
been O
working O
out O
a O
few O
years O
at O
this O
point. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don't O
know O
what O
to O
say O
about O
my O
calves, O
I B-Appearance
guess I-Appearance
being I-Appearance
obese I-Appearance
for B-Time
all I-Time
of I-Time
my I-Time
youth I-Time
helped O
a O
ton O
:D O
Nowadays O
I O
mostly O
run O
and O
skip O
rope, O
but O
that O
can O
still O
give O
a O
good O
burn O
in O
the O
calves O
every O
now O
and O
then. O
[SEP]
I O
vary O
the O
grips O
every O
now O
and O
then. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Last O
8 O
weeks O
were O
chin O
ups O
and O
wide O
grip O
pull O
ups, O
this O
cycle O
it's O
supinated O
pull O
ups O
and O
normal O
grip O
pull O
ups. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don't O
record O
the O
pull O
ups O
that O
often, O
but O
I O
did O
it O
yesterday O
after O
seeing O
this. O
So O
my O
supinated O
form O
looks O
like O
this: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
https://youtube.com/shorts/KtFmdz3J3JQ O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
try O
to O
get O
full O
ROM O
on O
all O
exercises, O
like O
letting O
rows O
and O
pull O
ups O
reach O
the O
bottom O
and O
stretch O
and O
let O
the O
bar O
/ O
dumbbells O
touch O
my O
chest O
when O
benching. O
[SEP]
It's O
a O
ULUL. O
So O
triceps, O
for O
instance, O
are O
getting O
hit O
4 O
times O
per O
week. O
[SEP]
The O
frequency O
is O
essentially O
2x O
for O
most O
muscles O
except O
arms O
that O
is O
4x. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
taking O
your O
points O
about O
frequency O
and O
work O
capacity O
for O
some O
muscles O
to O
heart O
though, O
I O
might O
reconsider O
what O
muscles O
I O
want O
/ O
need O
to O
focus O
on. O
[SEP]
Think O
I O
might O
just O
look O
into O
the O
RP O
Chest O
and O
Back O
specialization O
program O
or O
something O
similar O
now O
that O
all O
agree O
on O
those O
weakpoints! O
[SEP]
Rom O
is O
looking O
good. O
But O
do O
a O
slightly O
narrower O
grip O
to O
target O
the O
lats O
more. O
The O
lats O
get O
better O
leverage O
when O
the O
upper O
arm O
is O
closer O
to O
the O
ribs. O
[SEP]
It's O
not O
an O
upper O
lower O
split, O
but O
there O
are O
also O
upper O
lower O
splits O
with O
A O
and O
B O
days O
which O
have O
different O
frequencies O
[SEP]
Yeah O
that O
sounds O
good,, O
you O
have O
quite O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
the O
"yoked" O
physique O
covered O
already O
and O
you O
look O
good. O
I O
think O
you'll O
get O
there O
man, O
good O
luck O
on O
your O
journey! O
[SEP]
Cheers, O
I O
ended O
with O
this O
grip O
as O
a O
narrower O
grip O
gave O
me O
some O
elbow O
pain, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
about O
getting O
used O
to O
the O
exercise. O
[SEP]
It's O
upper- O
or O
lower- O
weighted. O
You'll O
notice O
squats O
& O
deadliftss O
(lower O
day). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
there's O
not O
big O
upper O
body O
compounds O
on O
this O
day, O
just O
bi-tri O
isolations. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
point O
is O
triceps O
get O
it O
4 O
times O
per O
week O
frequency O
in O
this O
scenario. O

A O
told O
me O
she O
tried O
reaching O
out O
to O
you O
but O
you O
were O
too O
busy. O
They O
were O
a O
bit O
blindsided O
by O
everything O
because O
we O
were O
your O
best O

We O
miss O
you, O
miss O
you O
playing O
with O
us, O
the O
car O

picking O
you O
up O
from O

getting O
boba, O
KBBQ, O
shoot O
even O
the O

Everyone O
is O
wondering O
how O
you’re O

no O
they O
didn’t O

I O

everyone O

Oh, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
boba O
spot O
we O
tried O
before O
you O
left. O
The O
one O
on O
San O
Pedro, O
when O
even O
though O
we O
were O
in O
the O
process O
of O
breaking O
up, O
you O
were O
feeding O
me O
the O
Korean O
corn O
dogs O
while O
I O
was O
driving. O
I O
went O
by O
the O
park O
we O
used O
to O
bring O
Pepper O
to, O
just O
to O
shoot O
around O
a O
bit. O
Ran O
into O
some O
of O
the O
other O
dogs O
there. O
How O
has O
Pepper O
been? O
Your O
mom O
hasn’t O
updated O
me O
about O
him. O
I’m O
surprised O
actually, O
considering O
she O
still O
checks O
up O
on O
me. O
I O
hope O
he’s O
not O
too O
depressed, O
he O
was O
really O
unhealthy O
looking O
during O

he’s O
been O
getting O
out O

I O
finally O

that O

I O

For O
whatever O

I O
never O

I O
also O

my O

on O
what O
tribal O
style O
to O
get, O
and O
what O
baybayin O
script O
to O
put. O
Man O
it’s O
so O
fun O
but O
hard O
to O
decide! O
Switched O
my O
style O
up O
a O
bit, O
was O
getting O
tired O
of O
looking O
really O
bummy O
wearing O
shorts O
and O
hoodies O
all O
the O
time. O
I O
mean O
it O
didn’t O
change O
much, O
but O
I O
got O
a O
bunch O
of O
sweaters O
and O
crew O
necks O
I O
can O
wear O
out. O
I O
think O
you’d O
like O
some O
lol. O
That O
reminds O
me, O
you O
never O
gave O
me O
back O
my O
stuff. O
I O
have O
like O
a O
crap O
ton O
of O
stuff O
there. O
My O
spare O
glasses O
too! O
You O
mentioned O
it O
early O
on O
that O
you’d O
give O
my O
stuff O
back, O
but O
it’s O
been O
like O
7 O
weeks O
since O
then. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Idk O
if O
you’d O
be O
happy O
to O
hear O
this O
or O
not, O
but O
I O
started O
talking O
to O
an O
old O
high O
school O
crush O
and O
went O
on O
a O
couple O
dates. O
Sadly, O
I O
had O
to O
tell O
her O
the O
truth: O
I O
wasn’t O
ready O
to O
move O
forward O
with O
anything. O
I O
wasn’t O
ready O
to O
fully O
commit O
myself O
and O
my O
love O
into O
a O
new O
relationship. O
I O
wouldn’t O
have O
been O
my O
best O
for O
her. O
I O
know O
now O
that O
I’m O
just O
not O
ready O
to O
love O
someone O
else, O
I’m O
still O
working O
on O
myself. O
I O
remember O
how O
you O
didn’t O
like O
when O
I O
got O
attention O
from O
girls. O
It O
was O
always O
a O
cute O
thing O
when O
you O
got O
mad. O
I O
know, O
I O
know, O
I O
shouldn’t O
tease O
about O
it. O
You O
were O
the O
only O
one O
for O
me O
before, O
and O
until O
I O
find O
that O
next O
one, O
you’ll O
still O
have O
a O
place O
in O
my O
heart. O
Now O
I O
understand O
all O
those O
songs O
like O
“My O
Boo” O
and O
stuff. O
It’s O
crazy, O
I’ve O
been O
in O
tons O
of O
relationships O
and O
other O
stuff, O
but O
nothing O
ever O
hurt O
like O
this. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Anyway, O
I O
hope O
you’ve O
been O
taking O
care O
of O
yourself. O
Toward O
the O
end O
of O
the O
relationship, O
you O
weren’t O
doing O
much O
for O
yourself O
aside O
from O
gaming. O
Have O
you O
been O
keeping O
up O
with O
your O
homework O
okay? O
I O
remember O
I O
was O
helping O
you O
with O
some O
of O
your O
business O
assignments O
and O
accounting O
papers. O
I O
wish O
you O
got O
out O
more. O
Just O
take O
care O
of O
yourself O
please. O
I O
know O
you’ve O
been O
home O
from O
the O
Philippines O
for O
about O
a O
week O
now. O
I’m O
glad O
I O
haven’t O
had O
to O
run O
into O
you O
around O
the O
city, O
would’ve O
been O
awkward. O
I O
plan O
on O
meeting O
up O
with O
your O
mom O
when O
she O
gets O
back O
too, O
I O
have O
presents O
from O
my O
family O
to O
you O
and O
yours. O
I O
won’t O
be O
giving O
you O
any O
sadly. O
That’s O
his O
job O
now. O

I O

someone O
I O

[SEP]
To O

with, O
I O
am O
\[18M\] B-Age_Gender
and O
is O
quite O
the O
outgoing O
social O
type O
of O
guy. O
Recently O
this O
college, O
I've O
had O
a O
friend O
whom O
I'll O
call O
King O
\[19M\] B-Age_Gender
have O
a O
crush O
on O
someone O
on O
our O
block, O
let's O
call O
her O
Anne O
\[18M\]. B-Age_Gender
Me O
being O
the O
outgoing O
social O
guy O
I O
offered O
to O
help O
King O
have O
a O
chance O
with O
Anne O
by O
first O
befriending O
Anne O
and O
then O
providing O
information O
about O
Anne's O
preferences O
and O
thoughts O
to O
King O
to O
help O
him O
understand O
her O
more. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Long O
story O
short, O
I O
was O
quite O
the O
social O
friendly O
out O
going O
guy O
so O
I've O
managed O
to O
befriend O
Anne O
to O
the O
point O
she's O
comfy O
to O
share O
her O
personal O
secrets O
to O
me. O
You O
could O
say O
I've O
managed O
to O
crack O
her O
guards O
down. O
Just O
to O
add O
Anne O
is O
quite O
the O
introverted O
shy O
person, O
she's O
quite O
secretive O
in O
which O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
King O
struggled O
to O
know O
her O
and O
accepted O
my O
offer O
of O
help. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
I've O
noticed O
that O
the O
longer O
I O
interacted O
with O
Anne O
I O
seem O
to O
have O
gain O
feelings O
for O
her, O
and O
it O
hurts O
me O
and O
my O
conscience O
every O
time O
I O
think O
of O
it; O
I O
feel O
quite O
scummy O
about O
having O
feelings O
for O
her O
as O
originally O
I O
only O
intended O
to O
help O
King O
set O
up O
with O
her. O
At O
first, O
it O
was O
subtle O
it O
was O
probably O
due O
to O
the O
trust O
Anne O
had O
in O
me O
for O
her O
to O
trust O
her O
personal O
secrets O
to O
me O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
warm, O
she's O
even O
quite O
pretty O
to O
speak O
of. O
Normally, O
we O
would O
walk O
together O
after O
college, O
since O
I'm O
the O
only O
guy O
she's O
quite O
comfy O
of O
but O
there O
was O
one O
instance O
where O
King O
and O
Anne O
was O
walking O
together. O
And O
I O
was O
at O
the O
back. O
I O
acted O
I O
supported O
King O
as O
I O
was O
openly O
supporting O
them O
due O
to O
my O
original O
intention O
at O
first O
to O
befriend O
Anne. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
was O
the O
moment, O
I O
realized O
I've O
gained O
feelings O
for O
Anne. O
I've O
never O
felt O
so O
self O
torn O
at O
that O
moment, O
I O
felt O
so O
jealous O
at O
King O
and O
so O
angry O
at O
myself O
for O
having O
feelings O
at O
Anne. O
I'm O
so O
angry O
and O
sad O
for O
why O
did O
I O
even O
fell O
for O
Anne. O
I've O
never O
felt O
so O
scummy O
ever O
before. O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
ruin O
my O
friendship O
with O
King O
just O
to O
have O
chance O
for O
Anne O
and O
I O
don't O
really O
want O
to O
tell O
Anne O
that O
I've O
gained O
feelings O
for O
her. O
I O
do O
not O
have O
any O
idea O
on O
what O
to O
do. O
I O
want O
this O
feeling O
to O
be O
gone O
but O
the O
more O
I O
push O
it O
away O
the O
stronger O
it O
comes O
to O
haunt O
me O
back. O
I O
genuinely O
hope O
for O
this O
feelings O
to O
be O
a O
quick O
happy O
crush O
but O
at O
this O
rate O
I'm O
despairing O
it O
won't O
just O
be O
a O
quick O
happy O
crush. O
I O
genuinely O
do O
want O
to O
ask O
your O
opinion O
on O
how O
should O
I O
proceed O
with O
this. O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
ruin O
my O
friendship O
with O
King O
nor O
do O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
Anne O
that O
I O
have O
feelings O
for O
her. O
I O
do O
want O
to O
get O
out O
of O
this O
situation O
but O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
if O
telling O
Anne O
that O
I O
have O
feelings O
for O
her O
is O
the O
only O
way O
out O
of O
the O
hole O
I've O
digged O
myself O
in. O
I'll O
do O
it. O

What O
you O
should O
do O
is O
tell O
King O
that O
you O
have O
feelings O
for O
Anne. O
Then O
decide O
what O
to O
do O
from O
there. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
still O
want O
to O
be O
friends O
with O
King O
then O
don't O
but O
if O
you O
don't O
care O
tell O
Anne O
you've O
been O
telling O
other O
people O
shit O
she O
shared O
with O
you O
and O
see O
how O
it O
works O
out O
[SEP]
Fuck O
king O
go O
for O
it O
[SEP]
I O
would O
rather O
tell O
Anne O
I O
have O
feelings O
for O
her O
than O
King. O
[SEP]
I O
haven't O
shared O
any O
personal O
secrets O
of O
Anne O
towards O
King. O
Actually O
before O
me O
and O
Anne O
got O
friends, O
I O
always O
asked O
her O
what O
she O
thought O
of O
King O
and O
I O
would O
always O
ask O
if O
King O
had O
a O
chance. O
I O
also O
did O
told O
her O
that O
I O
befriended O
her O
due O
to O
King O
and O
I'm O
thankful O
I O
did O
because O
I O
got O
to O
know O
her O
better. O
I O
also O
already O
told O
her O
that O
I O
would O
forward O
to O
king O
what O
Anne's O
preferences O
are O
but O
never O
her O
personal O
secrets. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
such O
a O
coward. O
For O
even O
doing O
this. O
I O
can O
see O
how O
much O
comfortable O
Anne O
is O
with O
me O
and O
it O
makes O
me O
feel O
so O
warm O
whenever O
I O
think O
of O
it. O
She O
used O
to O
sit O
alone O
or O
always O
sit O
randomly O
at O
our O
classes O
but O
now O
she O
always O
sits O
around O
next O
to O
me O
and O
I O
think O
it's O
sweet. O
But O
I O
can't O
just O
be O
a O
scummy O
bastard O
who O
steals O
his O
friend's O
crush. O
[SEP]
So O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
lose O
King O
as O
a O
friend? O
[SEP]
your O
feelings O
are O
a O
little O
inappropriate O
and O
disrespectful O
to O
King. O
is O
King O
even O
your O
friend? O
[SEP]
Shoot O
your O
shot, O
but O
don't O
expect O
king O
to O
stay O
friends O
even O
if O
he O
says O
he O
doesn't O
mind. O
[SEP]
Your O
friend O
is O
the O
coward O
and O
you O
would O
be O
betraying O
her, O
yourself O
and O
probably O
breaking O
her O
heart O
if O
you O
did O
nothing O
and O
left O
her O
to O
that O
idiot O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
know O
man O
King O
is O
quite O
also O
straightforward O
to O
her O
about O
his O
feelings O
its O
just O
that O
Anne O
isn't O
quite O
comfy O
with O
him. O
I O
really O
don't O
want O
to O
fuck O
up O
with O
King O
but O
if O
I O
have O
no O
other O
choice O
I'll O
probably O
talk O
it O
out O
with O
her O
it's O
just O
that O
I'm O
still O
hesitating. O
[SEP]
Just O
tell O
her O
how O
you O
feel, O
if O
she's O
into O
you O
just O
tell O
your O
friend O
you O
tried O
to O
set O
him O
up O
with O
a O
date O
and O
she O
said O
no O
because O
she O
was O

Got O
backstabbed O
at O
the O
pre-sale O
for O
the O
show O
in O
Amsterdam O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Yesterday O
I O
received O
an O
e-mail O
regarding O
the O
pre-sale O
that O
was O
promised O
by O
Abel O
and O
the O
XO O
team O
for O
previous O
ticket O
owners O
of O
the O
After O
Hours O
tour. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Back O
when O
the O
After O
Hours O
Till O
Dawn O
tour O
was O
announced, O
Abel O
put O
out O
an O
instagram O
post O
in O
which O
he O
explained O
the O
reasoning O
for O
cancelling O
the O
previous O
dates. O
He O
also O
stated O
that O
previous O
ticket O
owners O
would O
receive O
priority O
in O
buying O
tickets O
for O
new O
dates. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
yesterday O
I O
signed O
up O
for O
the O
pre-sale O
link. O
It O
stated O
that O
because O
I O
had O
bought O
tickets O
before O
I O
had O
early O
access O
to O
the O
tickets. O
But O
then O
I O
saw O
a O
TikTok O
add O
from O
Mojo O
(the O
promotor O
of O
the O
tour O
in O
the O
Netherlands), O
which O
stated O
that O
by O
clicking O
the O
link O
and O
signing O
up O
to O
their O
newsletter, O
subscribers O
would O
receive O
the O
link O
to O
the O
pre-sale O
as O
well. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
I O
asked O
my O
friend O
to O
do O
just O
that O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
people O
without O
previous O
tickets O
would O
also O
get O
access O
to O
the O
pre-sale. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
realized O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
hassle O
to O
get O
tickets O
since O
everyone O
had O
access O
to O
the O
pre-sale O
which O
was O
promised O
to O
only O
the O
previous O
ticket O
holders. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
today O
I O
didn’t O
manage O
to O
get O
the O
tickets O
I O
was O
promised O
and O
instead O
was O
waiting O
in O
a O
queue O
behind O
20.000 O
others O
(that O
is O
more O
than O
the O
capacity O
of O
the O
previous O
venue). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It’s O
safe O
to O
say O
I O
am O
deeply O
disappointed O
in O
the O
way O
this O
was O
handled O
and O
I O
honestly O
feel O
betrayed O
by O
the O
XO O
team O
and O
Abel. O
I O
don’t O
know O
how O
much O
they O
could’ve O
done O
about O
this O
and O
if O
this O
was O
truly O
their O
fault, O
but O
they O
failed O
to O
keep O
their O
promises O
and O
I O
am O
gutted. O

[SEP]
As B-Interests

this O
was O
my O
first O

seeing O
Abel O
live O
and O
I O
was O
waiting O
in O
excitement O
since O
2020, O
but O
I O
honestly O
don’t O
feel O
like O
going O
through O
this O
process O
again O
tomorrow O
at O
the O
regular O
ticket O
sale. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
sorry O
for O
ranting O
on O

it O
just O

there O
is O
no O

Bro O
I O
was O
in O
the O
queue O
behind O
22k O
people. O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
to O
the O
end O
they O
put O
me O
back O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
fucking O
queue O
[SEP]
For O
those O
who O
are O
from O
Amsterdam, O
maybe O
you O
could O
buy O
tickets O

I O
got O
mine O
at O
the O

I O
just O
checked O
now O
(15.41h) O

there O
are O
still O
tickets O
left O

happened O

I O
even O
had O

secured, O
transferred O
to O

app O
to O
approve O
the O
payment, O
then O
after O
approving O
ticket O
master O
told O
me O
my O
details O
were O
incorrect. O
This O
happened O
for O
two O

cards. O
I O
lost O
the O
tickets O

now O
there O
aren't O
any O
left O

We O

That O
combined O

really O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O

mouth. O
[SEP]
Yeah O
that O
priority O
shit O
was O
a O
giant O
scam O
by O
Ticketmaster. O
I O
received O
no O
emails O
about O
a O
presale O
and O
I O
just O
had O
to O
make O
a O
Live O
Nation O
account O
to O
have O
access O
to O
pre O
sale. O
I O
was O
fortunate O
that O
the O
European O
venues O
were O
easy O
to O
get O
tickets O
to, O
but O
its O
absolutely O
horrid O
what O
happened O
in O
UK O
and O
France. O
[SEP]
Contact O
a O
customer O
union, O
get O
info O
on O
your O
local/national O
laws. O

Edit O
: O
TicketMaster O
don't O
give O
a O
shit, O
they O
don't O
even O
have O
a O
customer O
support O
in O
my O
country. O
[SEP]
TM O
scammed O
us O
all. O
Went O
through O
a O
20k O
line O
just O
to O
get O
placed O
back O
in O
line. O
Was O
lucky O
and O
tried O
my O
work O
phone O
and O
got O
through O
eventually. O
Paid O
a O
ton O
for O
those O
standing O
tickets O
man. O
Not O
to O
mention O
the O
pricing O
of O
the O
tickets O
in O

shit O
that O
happened O
with O
Taylor O
Swift O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago. O
Ticketmaster O
doesn’t O
give O
a O
fuck, O
they O

either O
way. O
[SEP]

bro.. O
once O
i O

a O

[SEP]
also O
for O

well, O
try O

There O
are O
still O
places O
available. O
[SEP]
do O
you O
have O
a O
link O
to O
the O
presale O
perhaps? O
[SEP]
yeah.. O
i O
get O
the O
need O
to O
upscale O
to O
stadiums O
but O
the O
fact O
that O
previous O
ticket-holders O
were O
not O
given O
the O
priority O
as O
promised O
really O
hurts O
[SEP]
The O
same O
happened O

much, O
since O
we O
did O
get O
our O
tickets O
refunded O
back O
in O
the O
day, O
its O
just O
morally O
wrong O
thats O
all O
[SEP]
What O
a O
fucking O
lie O
that O
was. O
[SEP]
yeah O
happened O

Is O
it O

I O
can O
get O
better O

tomorrow O
during O

[SEP]
not O
sure, O
i O
also O
don’t O
know O
what O

ur O
tickets O
are O
for. O
all O
i O
know O
is O
that O
the O

being O
sold O
tomorrow O
for O
amsterdam O
are O
behind O
the O
stage O
:/ O
[SEP]
I O
dont O
think O
ticketmaster O
allows O
refunds, O
only O
ticket O
transfers/resale O
to O
other O
people O
[SEP]
Realky? O
How O
do O
you O
know? O
I O
bought O
tickets O
for O
Amsterdam O
today O
[SEP]
A O
resale O
is O
fine O
[SEP]
because O
mostly O
the O
front O
sections O
were O
sold O
during O
the O
pre.. O
but O
i O
might O
be O
wrong! O
[SEP]
They O
only O
have O
a O
certain O
amount O

for O

My O
ex O
(27m) B-Age_Gender
and O
I O
(27f) B-Age_Gender
met O
because O
we O
both O
worked/studied O
at O
the O
same O
place. O
He O
had O
been O
there O
a O
lot O
longer O
than O
I O
had, O
everyone O
there O
knew O
him O
and O
loved O
him. O
I O
was O
new, O
and O
still O
making O
an O
impression. O
I O
knew O
I O
loved O
him O
the O
moment O
I O
saw O
him. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
started O
dating O
pretty O
quickly, O
and O
things O
were O
going O
well. O
But O
work O
started O
going O
downhill, O
I O
realised O
that O
one O
of O
my O
managers O
(33f) B-Age_Gender
felt O
competitive O
with O
me O
and O
essentially O
hated O
my O
guts O
for O
no O
reason. O
I O
found O
out O
later O
that O
she'd O
had O
a O
thing O
for O
my O
ex. O
I O
tried O
a O
lot O
of O
mediation O
etc O
to O
get O
her O
to O
work O
with O
me O
in O
a O
civil O
manner, O
but O
that O
ended O
in O
a O
screaming O
match O
with O
her O
yelling O
at O
me O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
hallway O
at O
work. O
This O
happened O
about O
a O
year O
into O
working O
there. O
When O
I O
tried O
to O
seek O
support O
from O
other O
managers O
(37m/55m), B-Age_Gender
I O
was O
told O
that O
I O
was O
being O
selfish, O
two-faced O
and O
money O
driven. O
My O
relationship O
came O
up O
as O
being O
something O
that O
was O
apparently O
distracting O
me O
from O
work. O
I O
was O
incredibly O
damaged O
after O
this O
and O
I O
don't O
think O
I O
processed O
it O
as O
the O
pandemic O
had O
just O
started. O
[SEP]
My O
ex O
and O
I O
moved O
in O
together O
around O
this O
time. O
He O
is O
very O
close O
with O
his O
family O
and O
over O
time O
he O
told O
me O
they O
were O
my O
family O
too. O
For O
context, O
I B-Family
have I-Family
no I-Family
family I-Family
in I-Family
the I-Family
country I-Family
where I-Family
I I-Family
work I-Family
and O
a O
fairly O
small O
friend O
circle. O
He O
became O
my O
world, O
and O
I O
did O
any O
and O
every O
thing O
for O
him O
and O
his O
family. O
I O
could O
feel O
myself O
losing O
bits O
of O
me, O
but O
it O
felt O
easier O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
relationship, O
rather O
than O
deal O
with O
the O
reality O
of O
my O
managers O
at O
work. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
did O
tell O
me O
quite O
early O
on O
into O
moving O
in O
together O
that O
it O
was O
stressful O
for O
him O
to O
be O
around O
me O
because O
I B-Mental_Health
was I-Mental_Health
sad I-Mental_Health
and I-Mental_Health
depressed I-Mental_Health
about I-Mental_Health
work I-Mental_Health
a I-Mental_Health
lot I-Mental_Health
of I-Mental_Health
the I-Mental_Health
time, I-Mental_Health
and O
he O
tried O
to O
leave O
me O
a O
month O
into O
moving O
in O
together. O
(He O
came O
back O
the O
next O
morning O
and O
apologised O
profusely) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
we O
stayed O
together O
for O
2.5 O
years O
after O
moving O
in O
together. O
Yes O
we O
had O
fights O
and O
he O
often O
said O
he O
needed O
space, O
but O
I O
thought O
we O
were O
working O
through O
it. O
He O
kept O
wanting O
me O
to O
be O
around O
his O
family, O
and O
I O
was O
okay O
with O
it, O
even O
though O
at O
times O
I O
felt O
they O
could O
be O
very O
overbearing. O
They O
often O
made O
jokes O
that O
would O
trigger O
my O
anxiety, O
and O
this O
was O
aggravated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
i O
hadnt O
been O
able O
to O
see O
my O
family O
for O
over O
2 O
years O
because O
of O
the O
pandemic. O
His O
family O
became O
my O
family, O
i O
baked O
cakes O
at O
all O
of O
their O
birthdays O
and O
i O
always O
got O
presents O
for O
all O
extended O
family O
members O
at O
Christmas. O
We O
often O
talked O
about O
marriage O
and O
children, O
even O
though O
he O
initially O
said O
he O
didn't O
believe O
in O
it, O
he O
said O
he O
could O
picture O
that O
future O
with O
me. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Earlier O
this O
year, O
I O
got O
a O
new O
part O
time O
job O
that O
I O
really O
loved. O
But O
over O
time, O
I O
realised O
I O
didn't O
fit O
into O
his O
world O
anymore. O
I O
could O
feel O
us O
growing O
distant O
as O
we O
were O
no O
longer O
working O
together, O
and O
he O
wasn't O
very O
supportive O
of O
my O
new O
job. O
Around O
this O
time, O
I O
realised O
how O
much O
the O
incident O
with O
my O
manager O
had O
affected O
me, O
and O
I O
started O
getting O
help. O
My O
ex O
was O
not O
very O
supportive O
of O
my O
mental O
health O
journey, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
because O
he O
had O
become O
numb O
to O
how O
anxious O
and O
depressed O
I O
always O
was. O
Our O
fights O
became O
more O
frequent, O
and O
his O
arguments O
became O
more O
personal O
as O
he O
would O
call O
me O
a O
terrible, O
rude O
person. O
I O
acknowledge O
my O
part O
in O
this O
as O
the O
smallest O
things O
would O
set O
me O
off, O
and O
I O
was O
getting O
angry O
and O
anxious O
at O
things O
that O
usually O
wouldn't O
bother O
me. O
But O
we O
still O
had O
our O
good O
times, O
we O
would O
still O
talk O
about O
our O
future O
together, O
and O
how O
things O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
once O
I O
was O
fully O
wrapped O
up O
at O
my O
old O
job O
and O
settled O
full O
time O
into O
my O
new O
one. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Fast O
forward O
to O
two O
weeks O
ago, O
all O
my O
hard O
work O
of O
the O
year O
had O
culminated O
into O
a O
big O
week O
of O
events. O
I O
was O
very O
excited O
and O
hopeful O
for O
this O
week, O
as O
it O
was O
huge O
career O
wise O
for O
me. O
There O
was O
also O
going O
to O
be O
a O
party O
at O
my O
old O
work O
place- O
my O
ex's O
workplace O
at O
the O
end O
of O
that O
week O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
go O
and O
say O
goodbye O
to O
my O
old O
colleagues. O
We O
went O
out O
for O
his O
brother's O
birthday O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
that O
week O
and O
had O
a O
lovely O
time, O
I O
felt O
closer O
to O
my O
ex O
and O
his O
family O
than O
I O
have O
in O
a O
long O
time. O
On O
our O
walk O
home, O
my O
ex O
told O
me O
that O
he O
didn't O
want O
me O
to O
go O
to O
the O
party O
at O
his O
workplace O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
enjoy O
himself O
and O
not O
worry O
about O
me O
getting O
anxious. O
I O
was O
upset O
that O
he O
felt O
that O
way, O
and O
the O
fight O
escalated O
until O
he O
said O
he O
hated O
our O
relationship O
and O
didn't O
want O
to O
be O
with O
me O
anymore. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
was O
very O
hurt, O
but O
I O
acknowledged O
his O
feelings O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
take O
our O
space. O
My O
work O
events O
were O
successful, O
but O
I O
couldn't O
enjoy O
them O
because O
I O
was O
so O
devastated. O
He O
moved O
out O
to O
his O
mom's O
house O
after O
that O
week, O
and O
we O
tried O
to O
stay O
in O
touch O
but O
he O
put O
zero O
effort O
into O
keeping O
the O
conversation O
up. O
We O
met O
up O
a O
week O
later O
and O
I O
asked O
what O
was O
going O
on. O
He O
told O
me O
that O
he O
was O
firm O
in O
not O
wanting O
a O
relationship, O
and O
he O
didn't O
love O
me O
the O
way O
he O
should. O
I O
asked O
if O
we O
could O
work O
on O
it O
together, O
and O
he O
said O
no, O
that O
he O
needed O
to O
not O
be O
in O
a O
relationship O
for O
at O
least O
a O
month. O
And O
then O
maybe O
we O
could O
talk O
next O
year. O
I O
slept O
on O
it, O
and O
decided O
that O
it O
was O
unfair O
of O
him O
to O
leave O
me O
hanging O
for O
that O
long. O
I O
asked O
him O
to O
move O
all O
of O
his O
stuff O
out O
and O
I O
haven't O
seen O
him O
since. O
Ive O
said O
a O
lot O
of O
terrible O
things O
out O
of O
anger, O
asked O
to O
go O
NC O
and O
I O
fear O
that O
I've O
ruined O
any O
chances O
of O
reconciliation. O
It's O
been O
a O
week, O
and O
I O
still O
can't O
stop O
crying. O
The O
more O
time O
that O
passes, O
the O
more O
I O
realise O
how O
little O
he O
cared/loved O
me. O
I O
keep O
wishing O
he'll O
text, O
but O
he O
hasn't. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
so O
hurt O
and O
devastated O
that O
it O
ended O
this O
way O
after O
3.5 O
years. O
I O
was O
so O
close O
to O
him O
and O
his O
family, O
and O
I O
feel O
like O
I'm O
losing O
a O
whole O
family O
along O
with O
this O
relationship. O
It's O
his O
birthday O
in O
a O
few O
days O
and O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
I O
should O
wish O
him. O
I O
feel O
so O
hurt O
and O
lost. O
I O
still O
haven't O
recovered O
from O
my O
workplace O
incident O
and O
I O
just O
don't O
know O
if O
I'll O
ever O
be O
okay O
again. O
Part O
of O
me O
wonders O
if O
he O
lost O
love O
and O
respect O
for O
me O
because O
I O
couldn't O
cut O
it O
at O
his O
workplace. O
Feeling O
really O
devastated O
and O
heartbroken- O
I O
gave O
this O
relationship O
my O
all O
when O
I O
had O
so O
little O
to O
give, O
and O
my O
anxiety O
has O
been O
at O
an O
all O
time O
high. O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
he O
even O
misses O
me. O
I O
keep O
blaming O
myself O
for O
the O
breakup O
and O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
to O
stop. O
Sorry O
about O
the O
long O
post, O

to O
to O
start O

The O

"out" O
is O
to O
work O
on O

until O
you're O
able O
to O
set O
healthy O

such O

I'm B-Occupation

who O
recently O

I O
had O
a O

who O
liked O
a O

asked O
me O
to O
have O
it O
printed O
24 O
X O
30 O
on O
aluminum. O
I O
delivered O
it. O
He O
opened O
it O
and O
noticed O
a O
couple O
places O
where O
there O
was O
black O
on O
the O
image. O
He O
said O
something O
was O
wrong. O
I O
showed O
him O
that O
those O
places O
were O
black O
on O
the O
original O
but O
told O
him O
that O
I O
could O
edit O

reprint. O
I O
told O
him, O
honestly, O
that O
I O
want O
him O
to O
be O
happy O
hanging O
the O
work O
and O
that O
I O
would O
pay O
for O
the O

He O
returned O
the O
copy O
that O
he O
was O
unhappy O
with. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
edited O
the O
piece, O
got O
his O
approval O
and O
sent O
out O
for O
a O
reprint. O
I O
sold O
the O
piece O
for O
$325. O
The O
two O
prints O
together O
will O
cost O
me O
more O
than O
that. O
So, O
last O
night O
I O
sent O
him O
a O

asked O
if O
he'd O
pitch O
in O

the O

the O

He O
has O
not O
yet O
answered. O
Now O
I O
go O
back O

forth O
feeling O
like O
a O

I O

it's O

to O
not O
want O

(maybe O
even O
at O

- O
make O
no O

don't O

[SEP]
If O
the O
piece O
was O
$325 O
and O
the O
printing O
costs O
$100, O
you O
should O
have O
told O
the O
client, O
“listen, O
here’s O
what O
we’ll O
do. O
A O
reprint O
will O
cost O
$200. O
I’ll O
split O
it O
with O
you. O
Shipping O
will O
be O
about O
$50.” O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
would O
sound O
like O
you’re O
helping O
them O
out, O
when O
in O
fact, O
you’re O
not. O
[SEP]
Honestly, O
you O
can't O
change O
your O
mind O
on O
the O
price O
after O
the O
fact. O
If O
that O
same O
situation O
were O
to O
happen O
in O
the O
future O
you O
should O
send O
a O

proof O
for O

before O
you O
print O
& O
charge O
more O
for O
the O
reprint O
post O
proof O
approval O
because O
it's O
custom O
work. O
I O
understand O
reprints O
if O
the O
printer O
is O
faulty, O
but O
to O
replace O
a O
perfectly O
good O
piece O
is O
admitting O
fault O
where O
there O
is O
none. O
[SEP]
Thanks O
everyone. O
He O
offered O
to O
chip O
in O
an O
extra O
$50 O
and O
I O
told O
him O
that O
I'd O
stick O
to O
my O
original O
offer. O
The O
prints O
are O
almost O
$200 O
each, O
so O
I'll O
lose O
a O
bit O
on O
this O
sale. O
I'm O
just O
going O
to O
chalk O
it O
up O
to O
a O
learning O
experience. O
[SEP]
You O
can't O
change O
the O
price O
after O
you've O
already O
sent O
out O
the O
piece. O
That's O
very O
odd O
and O
unprofessional. O
Not O
making O
a O
reprint, O
or O
asking O
money O
for O
it O
ahead O
of O
time, O
would O
have O
been O
reasonable. O
But O
once O
you O
agreed O
to O
it, O
you O
can't O
really O
change O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Maybe O
you O
can O
sell O
the O
original O
print O
to O
someone O
else O
and O
recoup O
some O
of O
the O
money O
that O
way? O
Assuming O
the O
customer O
doesn't O
agree O
to O
pay O
your O
new O
price. O
[SEP]
Don't O
edit O
your O
shit O
after O
the O
fact O
like O
that. O
All O
sales O
are O
final. O
[SEP]
It O
depends. O
If O
the O
customer O
got O
something O
other O
than O
what O
they O
purchased, O
I O
try O
to O
examine O
what O
happened O
and O
eat O
the O
screwup. O
It O
has O
happened O
maybe O
3 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
5 O
years. O
If O
a O
customer O
got O
something O
as O
advertised, O
and O
make O
complaints, O
I O
do O
nothing O
to O
fix O
it. O
If O
they O
want O
to O
customize O
their O
print O
its O

The O
vast O

people O
are O
good, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
small O
percentage O
of O
people O
who O
will O
take O
advantage O
of O
you O
and O
ask O
for O
things O
out O

line. O
One O
example O
I O
had O
about O
10-11 O
years O
ago O
was O
a O
guy O
who O
wanted O
to O
buy O
five O
giclee O
prints O
from O
me. O
Big O
order, O
but O
I O
have O
done O
it O
before. O
He O
wanted O
to O
show O
them O
to O
his O
wife, O
have O
her O
pick O
out O
one, O
and O
then O
return O
the O
other O
4 O
and O
have O
me O
refund O
him O
his O
money. O
I O
told O
him O
these O
were O
all O
print O
to O
order O
and O
my O
business O
policy O
(which O
is O
stated O
on O
my O
website) O
is O
that O
I O
do O
not O
return O
prints O
that O
are O
not O
defective O
(and O
uhhh, O
if O
I O
delivery O
the O
prints O
and O
they O
look O
fine, O
and O
you O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
defective, O
we O
are O
both O
going O
to O
know O
you O
are O
lying). O
[SEP]

He O
responded O
with O
"Well O
you O
know, O
at O
Costco O
you O
can O
return O
stuff, O
I O
don't O
see O
how O
this O
is O
any O
different". O
I O
told O
him O
this O
isn't O
Costco, O
I B-Occupation
am I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
small I-Occupation
business, I-Occupation
I O
do O
not O
have O
warehouses O
for O
inventory, O
he O
wanted O
stuff O
that O
i O
would O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
and O
then O
deal O
with. O
I O
asked O
him O
to O
show O
his O
wife O
pictures O
and O
then O
ask O
which O
one O
she O
wants O
"I O
want O
it O
to O
be O
a O
surprise O
for O
her!, O
you O
know, O
something O
nice". O
I O
explained O
that O
it O
was O
more O
or O
less O
me O
doing O
something O
for O
his O
wife O
as O
I O
would O
have O
to O
eat O
the O
cost. O
These O
were O
people O
who O
were O
probably O
55-60 O
at O
the O
time. O
His O
wife O
is O
an O
adult. O
She O
can O
pick O
which O
one O
she O
wants O
on O
the O
computer O
screen. O

The O
other O
time O
I O
can O
recall O
was O
an O
institution O
where O
the O
manager O
had O
to O
approve O
of O
the O
picture. O
Everyone O
loves O
the O
art, O
but O
the O
manager O
wanted O
to O
make O
some O
color O
alterations. O
I O
am O
convinced O
they O
did O
so O
because O
they O
are O
a O
task O
master O
(look O
up O
the O
Bullshit O
Jobs O
book O
for O
the O
Task O
Master) O
and O
need O
to O
have O
their O
hands O
on O
everything, O
even O
things O
which O
do O
not O
actively O
require O
management. O
His O
job O
wasn't O
to O
make O
sure O
things O
look O
good, O
his O
job O
was O
to O
add O
steps O
so O
it O
shows O
he O
was O
participating. O
This O
is O
where O
the O
$175 O

for O

comes O
from. O
[SEP]

Usually, O
if O
someone O
buys O
something O
and O
dislike O

thats O
on O
them. O
Its O
my O
job O
to O
deliver O
what O
they O
ordered, O
not O
to O
cater O
to O
their O
every O
need. O
[SEP]
I O
hate O
to O
say O
it, O
but O
I O
agree, O
you O
can't O
go O
back O
on O
your O
offer. O
That O
said, O
I O
wouldn't O
feel O
too O
bad O
about O
asking, O
they O
might O
have O
been O
happy O
to O
do O
it O
and O
it O
all O
would O
have O
worked. O
You O
could O
now O
recover O
by O
writing O
back O
and O
saying O
after O
you O
had O
a O
minute O
to O
think O
on O
it O
you O
feel O
bad O
about O
asking O
and O
want O
to O
continue O
with O
your O
original O
agreement. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
then O
you O
can O
chalk O
this O
up O
to O
the O
cost O
of O
education. O
Some O
people O
pay O
thousands O
to O
go O
to O
college, O
this O
was O
one O
of O
your O
lessons. O
In O
future O
you'll O
do O
things O
a O
little O
different. O

Congrats O

the O
sale! O
[SEP]
Yeah O
I O
have O
had O
this O
happen O
time O
and O
time O
again. O
Sometimes O
I O
worked O
for O
like O
2.5$ O
an O
hour O
if O
you O
count O
it, O
because O
I O
would O
take O
on O
a O
huge O
project O
for O
like O
400$ O
but O
then O
spend O
an O
eternity O
finishing O
the O
piece O
and O
then O
the O
client O
would O
ask O
for O
a O
revision. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Always O
makes O
me... O
aggravated. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
I O
bumped O
up O
the O
prices. O
You O
never O
know O
how O
the O
job O
will O
go O
or O
who O
the O
client O
is O
as O
an O
individual. O
Being O
an O

a O

Well, O
I O
wouldn’t O
have O
asked O
for O
payment O
after O
saying O
it O
wasn’t O
required, O
but O
since O
that O
is O
where O
you O
are, O
you O
could O
either O
A. O
Leave O
it O
and O
not O
message O
them O
again O
or O
B. O
Send O
them O
another O
message O
apologizing O
for O
asking O
for O
payment O
and O
telling O
them O
not O
to O
worry O
about O
it, O
you O
can O
try O
to O
make O
up O
something O
about O
extra O
fees O
you O
were O
charged O
that O
you O
didn’t O
expect O
or O
something O
but O
it’s O
a O
bad O
look O
to O
have O
asked O
for O
payment O
after O
saying O
it O
would O
be O
free. O
[SEP]
1. O
Make O
sure O
the O
customer O
has O
access O

very O
clear O

angles O

necessary O
to O

what O
it O
looks O

with O
light O
reflecting O
off O

would O
be O
if O
there’s O
a O
glaring O
issue O
that O
multiple O

out. O
The O
customer O
not O
liking O
the O
use O
of O
black O
on O
part O
of O
the O
image O
is O
an O
issue O
with O
the O
customer’s O
personal O
taste, O

not O
your O
work. O
Don’t O
sacrifice O

If O
you’ve O
already O
stated O
you’ll O
cover O
the O
cost, O
*cover O
the O
cost.* O
Do O
not O
ask O
a O
buyer O
for O
extra O
money O
after O
you’ve O
stated O
you’ll O
pay O
for O
a O
reprint. O
You’re O
just O
going O
to O
have O
to O
eat O
that O
loss O
at O
that O
point. O
If O
you O
weren’t O
sure O
how O
to O
handle O
this, O
you O
could’ve O
told O
the O
buyer O
“I’ll O
see O
what O
I O
can O
do, O
and O
get O
back O
to O
you.” O
Then O
take O
some O
time O
to O
think O
about O
how O
to O
handle O
the O
situation O
or O
ask O
for O
advice O
if O
needed. O
[SEP]
You O
cant O
ask O
for O
money O
from O
the O
client. O
You O
should O
always O
before O
printing O
get O
a O
client O
to O
sign O
a O
proof O
sheet. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
This O
way O
you O
are O
covered O
for O
this O
very O
situation. O
You'd O
of O
been O
able O
to O
show O
they O
approved O
the O
first O
print O
"as O
is". O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
you O
didn't O
do O
that O
and O
offered O
to O
edit O
and O
reprint O
at O
your O
own O
cost, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
just O
accept O
the O
loss. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
put O
the O
first O
print O
up O
for O
sale O
though O
if O
its O
not O
a O
photo O
of O
the O
client O
themselves O
or O
a O
person O
without O
a O
model O
release. O
[SEP]
It O
happens O
... O
an O
assumption O
of O
fees O
illustrates O
how O
critically O
important O
rates O
are. O
"Let O
me O
verify O
another O
copy O
fee O
and O
shipping O
and O
I'll O
get O
back O
to O
you." O
[SEP]
In O
the O
future O
, O
the O
price O
of O
your O
print O
should O
always O
be O
the O
cost O
x O
2.5. O
This O
allows O
for O
errors O
like O
this, O
while O
adding O
a O
little O
wiggle O
room O
to O
make O
a O
profit O
in O
this O
worse O
case O
scenario. O
[SEP]
Can O
you O
list O
it O
as O
ready O
to O
ship O
holiday O
offer O
and O
try O
to O
get O
a O
sale O
that O
way? O
[SEP]
I O
did O
pay O
thousands O
to O
go O
to O
college O
and O
business O
school O
to O
boot. O
I O
know O
better. O
I'm O
not O
thinking O
straight. O
[SEP]
He O
offered O
to O
kick O
in O
an O
extra O
$50 O
and O
I O
told O
him O
never O
mind. O
[SEP]
In O
fairness O
to O
myself, O
the O
customer O
saw O
the O
piece O
at O
an O
art O
show. O
He O
looked O
at O
it O
for O
a O
good O
ten O
minutes. O
He O
didn't O
take O
that O
physical O
piece O
only O
because O
I'd O
dropped O
it O
and O
there O
was O
chip O
on O
the O
edge O
where O
it O
hit O
the O
pavement O
and O
I O
insisted O
that O
he O
have O
an O
intact O
piece. O
[SEP]
The O
original O
one O
? O
[SEP]
so O
you O
flip O
flop O
on O
him, O
and O
then O
when O
he O
said O
yes, O
you O
flip O
flop O
again. O
and O
entire O
change O
was O
for O
customer O
who O
knew O
what O
they O
had. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
you O
gotta O
stop O
this, O
or O
you O
will O
never O
get O
off O
the O
ground O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
that O
would O
be O
odd, O
then, O
that O
he’d O
complain O
about O
the O
black O
color O
when O
he O
saw O
it O
up O
close O
and O
in O
person! O
[SEP]
I O
can O
try. O
I O
don't O
sell O
a O
ton O
of O
my O
work O
and O
have O
never O
sold O
anything O
online. O
[SEP]
You're O
right. O
I O
messed O
this O
one O
up. O
[SEP]
I O
mean O
you’ve O
got O
nothing O
to O
lose O
[SEP]
don't O
focus O

what O
you O

focus O

I O
may O
be O
wrong, O
but O
from O
what O
I O
recollect, O
you O
are O
not O
familiar O
with O
this O
tool O
and O
that O
could O
probably O
be O
the O
reason O
why O
it O
takes O
10+ O

If O
your O

u/raddiwallah O

I O
checked O
your O
profile O
seems O
like O
you O
have O
been O
struggling O
since O
many O
months. O
stop O
working! O
seriously. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
In O
my O
experience, O
companies O
don’t O
deliberately O
exploit O
people O
but O
people O
literally O
surrender O
and O
open O
their O
arms O
for O
exploitation. O

[SEP]
7 O
years O
in O
witch O
here, O
today O
I O
will O
watch O
topgun O
mavericks O
in O
office O
time, O
not O
bragging O
just O
to O
give O
you O
a O
reality O
check. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Its O
up O
to O
you O
if O
you O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
same O
situation O
or O
not. O
I O
have O
seen O
some O
folks O
stuck O
in O
similar O
situation O
since O
a O
decade. O
Yeah O
sure O
they O
can O
say O
manager O
is O
asshole O
but O
question O
is O
why O
couldn’t O
they O
just O
move O
on. O
I O
think O
they O
themselves O
don’t O
believe O
that O
there O
is O
any O
hope O
left. O
Please O
don’t O
be O
like O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can’t O
change O
things O
in O
your O
current O
project O
so O
its O
time O
to O
move O
on. O
And O
stop O
working, O
do O
bare O
minimum. O
Take O
leaves O
when O
you O
feel O
like O
it. O
Trust O
me O
your O
company O
wont O
do O
jack O
shit O
unless O
you O
literally O
commit O
a O
crime O
like O
data O
leak. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
should O
try O
to O
switch O
to O
other O
witch O
with O
minimum O
hike O
expectations O
so O
you O
can O
get O
an O
offer O
or O
go O
for O
any O
small O
company. O
And O
then O
just O
focus O
on O
interviews O
completely. O
Good O
luck. O
[SEP]
see O
the O
best O
way O
to O
not O
get O
in O
trouble O
is O
always O
informing O
stakeholders O
aboutt O
blockers O
[SEP]
[SEP]
a O

Better O
to O
not O
respond, O
and O
keep O
your O
sanity O
rather O
than O
keep O
wasting O
time O
for O
a O

that O
doesn't O
give O
two O

about O
you O

the O

Investing O

in O

be O
much O
better. O
[SEP]
Working O
hours O
are O
generally O
9-6. O
Be O
responsive O
then. O
Outside O
of O
these O
hours O
they O
have O
no O
business O
demanding O
anything O
off O
you. O
[SEP]
they'll O
act O
like O
it's O
a O
big O
issue O
but O
they O
can't O
do O
shit O
if O
they're O
trying O
to O
contact O
you O
after O
work O
hours. O
especially O
freshers O
they O
try O
to O
take O
advantage O
since O
they're O
new O
to O
work O
culture O
and O
not O
seniors O
since O
they O
don't O
give O
a O
shit. O
also O
if O
you O
feel O
any O
meetings O
and O
working O
happens O
during O
personal O
time O
bring O
to O
manager. O
any O
half O
decent O
ones O
worth O
their O
salt O
will O
help O
you. O
[SEP]
Got O
it. O
Thanks. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
replying. O
[SEP]
To O
be O
honest, O
that's O
a O
very O
scary O
thing O
to O
do, O
to O
not O

even O
if O
it O
is O
after O

I'll O

Anyway, O
yesterday O
I O
receive O
a O
phone O
call O
from O
a O
man O
who O
said O
he O
was O
from O
the O
umbrella O
company O
who O
worked O
with O
my O
agency O
and O
wanted O
to O
talk O
me O
through O
a O
couple O
of O
different O
methods O
of O
payment O
before O
my O
first O
wage O
comes O
through O
this O
Friday. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
proceeds O
to O
offer O
me O
two O
options, O
please O
bare O
in O
mind O
I O
am O
not O
clued O
on O
on O
tax O
so O
if O
this O
does O
not O
make O
much O
sense O
it O
may O
be O
because O
I O
have O
not O
remembered O
the O
info O
correctly. O
He O
tells O
me O
the O
first O
option O
and O
leads O
with O
the O
amount O
I’ll O
be O
getting O
paid O
which O
was O
around O
£1150 O
per O
week. O
At O
this O
point O
alarm O
bells O
are O
already O
ringing O
as O
it O
is O
significantly O
higher O
than O
what O
I O
have O
worked O
out O
I O
should O
be O
taking O
home O
myself. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
tells O
me O
all O
I O
need O
to O
do O
is O
put O
aside O
£72 O
per O
week O
and O
when O
HMRC O
come O
around O
in O
April O
I O
will O
pay O
them O
the O
money O
I’ve O
put O
aside O
and O
explained O
that O
this O
was O
just O
the O
accounting O
side O
of O
things O
(didn’t O
make O
sense O
to O
me O
but O
he O
carries O
on) O
he O
then O
says O
they O
will O
need O
to O
pay O
me O
into O
two O
separate O
bank O
accounts, O
one O
will O
have O
around O
750 O
paid O
into O
it O
and O
the O
other O
will O
have O
around O
350 O
paid O
into O
it O
and O
explained O
that O
1 O
of O
the O
payments O
is O
‘profit’ O
(I O
don’t O
understand O
what O
this O
means O
either?). O
He O
said O
if O
I O
choose O
this O
route O
they O
will O
send O
me O
a O
contract O
to O
sign O
- O
baring O
in O
mind O
I O
have O
already O
signed O
a O
contract O
when O
I O
first O
started O
with O
my O
agency. O
He O
also O
said O
I O
might O
prefer O
this O
route O
because O
I O
wouldn’t O
have O
to O
make O
any O
student O
loan O
contributions. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
then O
said O
that O
the O
second O
option O
entails O
me O
being O
paid O
into O
1 O
bank O
account O
and O
coming O
out O
with O
around O
£850 O
per O
week, O
my O
student O
loan O
contributions O
will O
be O
made O
and O
it O
is O
through O
a O
‘PAYE’ O
method. O
He O
also O
said O
I O
will O
also O
be O
optics O
into O
a O
pension O
scheme O
which O
I O
can O
opt O
out O
of. O
This O
option O
seemed O
far O
less O
complicated O
and O
aligned O
with O
what O
I O
had O
already O
pre-empted O
my O
pay O
to O
be. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
told O
him O
I O
would O
have O
a O
think O
and O
let O
him O
know O
what O
I O
would O
prefer O
in O
the O
morning. O
I O
have O
done O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
googling O
and O
have O
spent O
most O
of O
last O
night O
and O
this O
morning O
learning O
about O
umbrella O
companies O
and O
the O
horrendous O
loan O
charge O
scandal. O
From O
what O
I O
had O
learnt O
I O
felt O
option O
2 O
would O
be O
the O
legit O
way O
and O
rang O
him O
this O
morning O
to O
say O
I O
would O
like O
to O
take O
the O
lower O
amount O
and O
make O
my O
student O
loan O
contributions O
he O
said O
this O
was O
fine O
and O
was O
polite O
enough. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
first O
question O
is, O
is O
what O
they O
are O
offering O
illegal? O
My O
second O
is O
should O
I O
change O
umbrella O
companies O
completely? O
I’m O
fairly O
certain O
they O
are O
dodgy O
but O
I O
feel O
confident O
I O
have O
chosen O
the O
right O
option, O
I O
just O
don’t O
want O
to O
experience O
any O
trouble O
with O
HMRC O
later O
down O
the O
line O
from O
the O
collateral O
of O
any O
potential O
trouble O
my O
umbrella O
company O
might O
find O
themselves O
in. O
This O
is O
my O
first O
role O
outside O
of O
a O
perm O
contract O
and O
I B-Occupation
am I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
fairly I-Occupation
young I-Occupation
social I-Occupation
worker I-Occupation
(24) B-Age
this O
job O
is O
all O
I O
have O
ever O
done O
since O
graduating O
and O
I O
am O
passionate O
about O
it O
so O
do O
not O
want O
to O
do O
anything O
that O
might O
risk O
my O
career O
or O
future. O

Option O
2 O
would O
be O
the O
legitimate O
option. O
[SEP]
Option O
1 O
appears O
that O
you O
would O
be O
declared O
as O
a O
company O
or O
as O
a O
sole O
trader. O
Its O
up O
to O
yourself O
but O
if O
you O
want O
the O
easier O
option O
and O
are O
happy O
with O
the O
amount O
I O
would O
do O
with O
option O
2. O
[SEP]
Is O
the O
contract O
inside O
IR35 O
or O
outside? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
if O
its O
in O
the O
option O
2 O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
correct.. O
if O
its O
outside O
then O
you O
should O
setup O
a O
ltd O
company O
and O
you O
sort O
your O
tax O
affairs O
yourself.. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
with O
ANY O
umbrella O
you O
should O
be O
logging O
onto O
your O
personal O
HMRC O
tax O
account O
to O
ensure O
they O
are O
actually O
paying O
your O
taxes O
for O
you O
regardless O
of O
what O
it O
says O
on O
your O
payslip O
- O
do O
this O
every O
single O
month O
regardless... O
HMRC O
have O
made O
it O
quite O
plain O
in O
the O
past O
that O
if O
they/you O
have O
been O
scammed O
out O
of O
your O
tax O
money O
they O
don't O
care O
and O
want O
it O
anyway O
from O
you O
pronto O
- O
with O
the O
dodgy O
options O
your O
being O
presented O
I O
would O
disengage O
from O
this O
company O
immediately... O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
a O
side O
note O
I've O
used O
NASA O
in O
the O
past O
and O
they O
paid O
my O
taxes O
- O
notice O
I O
didn't O
say O
they O
were O
good... O
all O
umbrellas O
should O
really O
all O
be O
the O
same O
as O
you O
are O
essentially O
buying O
a O
payroll O
service O
thats O
it.. O
[SEP]
Option O
2, O
just O
make O
sure O
you're O
receiving O
your O
holiday O
pay O
and O
they're O
not O
skimming O
it O
off. O
[SEP]
Worthwhile O
staying O
in O
the O
pension O
imo. O
[SEP]
OP, O
you've O
got O
your O
head O
screwed O
on O
just O
right. O
If O
an O
offer O
seems O
"too O
good O
to O
be O
true" O
then O
it O
usually O
is. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
the O
end O
client O
is O
in O
the O
public O
sector O
then O
I'd O
suggest O
letting O
them O
know. O
I O
am O
not O
clued O
up O
enough O
on O
tax O
to O
know O
what O
ruse O
the O
brolly O
is O
pulling, O
but O
it O
feel O
pretty O
shady. O
[SEP]
I O
hope O
I O
am O
not O
too O
late. O
Do O
not O
go O
with O
option O
one! O
An O
umbrella O
company O
that O
suggests O
paying O
money O
in O
2 O
different O
bank O
accounts O
smell O
really O
bad... O
period. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
is O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
Umbrella O
Companies O
don't O
have O
"a O
statutory O
definition" O
for O
HMRC. O
Therefore O
as O
long O
as O
HMRC O
is O
aware, O
an O
Umbrella O
Company O
is O
like O
a O
normal O
permanent O
employer. O
So O
it O
is O
different O
because O
you O
are O
now O
an O
agency O
worker O
but O
how O
you O
will O
be O
paid O
shouldn't. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
created O
this O
calculator O
where O
you O
can O
calculate O
your O
Umbrella O
Pay O
very O
accurately: O
[https://payslipbuddy.co.uk/umbrella-company-calculator](https://payslipbuddy.co.uk/umbrella-company-calculator) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
the O
money O
you O
receive O
is O
way O
higher O
than O
what O
was O
returned O
to O
the O
calculator, O
I O
would O
advise O
you O
to O
run. O
But O
anyway, O
based O
on O
what O
they O
suggested, O
I O
would O
leave O
them O
anyway. O
I O
can't O
see O
how O
option O
1 O
is O
not O
a O
DR O
Scheme. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
next O
thing O
you O
should O
do O
is O
create O
your O
tax O
account O
on O
the O
HMRC O
website. O
A O
few O
workers O
know O
this, O
but O
all O

our B-Family
families I-Family

going I-Family
through I-Family
a I-Family
rough I-Family

Everything O
was O
normal O
and O
I O
usually O
keep O
a O
smile O
on. O
After O
the O

my O

him O
went O
together, O

I O
went O
back O

on O

My O

just O
asked O
me O
to O
send O
his O

3$ O
(Its O

money O
here, O

so O
he O
could O
eat O
something O

had O
nothing O
in O

at O
all, O
didn't O
tell O
anyone, O
didn't O
show O
any O
signs, O
might O
have O
been O
hungry O
the O
whole O

who O

My O
father O
was O
pissed O
at O
him O
for O
not O
asking O
even O
though O
we O
dont O
have O
not O
alot O
but O
it's O
heartbreaking O
to O
know O
someone O
respectable, O
never O
lied, O
never O
cheated, O
works O
for O
a O
non O

is O
hungry O
since O
god O

sick. O

if O
they O

and O
the O

Also, O
if O

the O

I O
decided O

Missed O

booked O

With O

everyone O
scanned O

out O

it’s O

[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
only O
had O
to O

we O

the O

Maybe O
if O
you O

This O
is O

the O

It O
has O
nothing O

two O

is O
actually O
very O
handy O
in O
this O

you O
are O
never O
without O
one. O

Very O
true, O
it O
can O
be O
handy O
- O
and O
I O
don't O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
fact O
they O
had O
to O
keep O
my O
passport. O
I O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
them O
being O
unprofessional O
- O
they O
said O
they O
need O
15 O
working O
days O
to O
process O
visa. O
Out O
of O
nowhere, O
they O
started O
making O
up O
some O
new O
rules O
and O
said O
it O
will O
be O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
instead O
and O
would O
not O
return O
any O
of O
my O
calls/emails O
since. O
[SEP]
Yes O
you O
can O
definitely O
do O
that. O
Problem O
is O
if O
you O
didn’t O
enter O
on O
it O
, O
and O
now O
need O
to O
leave O
& O
don’t O
have O
the O

in O

EU O
Id O

Trust O
me O
the O

guards O
are O
not O
happy O
when O
the O
entry O
and O
exit O
stamps O
don’t O
match O
up O
[SEP]
Please O
don't O
do O
this. O
Your O
original O
passport O
will O
be O
invalidated. O
You're O
better O
off O
going O
to O
the O
South O
African O
embassy, O
withdraw O
your O
visa O
application O
and O
retrieve O
your O
passport. O
[SEP]
Usually O
we O
don’t O

I B-Health

I I-Health
could I-Health
be I-Health
autistic. I-Health
Now O
after O
two O
years O
I O
think O
it’s O
pretty O
certain O
that O
I O
am. O

around O
me O
think O
so O
too O

my O

who O
are O
against O
diagnoses O

anything O
that O
isn’t O
“physical O

said O
I O

have O

Well, O
the O
whole O

is O
autism O
resources O
have O
saved O
my O
life. O
And O
understanding O
that O
I O
perhaps O
wasn’t O
weird O
and O
just O
a O
little O
difference O
made O
me O
feel O
a O
lot O
more O
confident O
after O
years O

school O
bullying. O
But O
I O
don’t O
want O
an O

I O
don’t O
want O
medical O

doctors O
are O
often O
rude O

invalidating O

I O
am O
sensitive. O
I O
also O
don’t O
want O
it O
because O
I O
don’t O
want O
it O
to O
bother O
my O
future O

I O
don’t O
know. O
I O
function O

if O
you O
have O
carefully O
researched O
the O
topic O
and O
strongly O
resonate O
with O
the O
experience O
of O
the O
autistic O
community, O
you O
are O
probably O
autistic." O
[SEP]
I O
have O
never O
related O
to O
a O
post O
more O
in O
my O
entire O
life. O
It’s O
really O
nice O
to O
see O
the O
validation O
from O
the O
community O
around O
self O
diagnosis O
and O
the O
awkward O
path O
it O
takes O
to O
get O
there O
[SEP]
My O
therapist O
who O
diagnosed O
me O
advised O
me O
not O
to O
get O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
as O
it O
can O
limit O
my O
future, O
such O
as O
if O
I O
want O
to O
adopt O
or O
foster O
or O
move O
to O
another O
country. O
She O
said O
only O
if O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
need O
the O
help. O
It’s O
sad O
that O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
is O
so O
limiting O
😞 O
[SEP]
I O
tried O
to O
get O
diagnosed O
but O
my O
mom O
said O
there O
was O
nothing O
weird O
about O
me O
growing O
up O
at O
all O
meanwhile O
she O
is O
probably O
autistic O
too, O
but O
my O
doc O
was O
just O
like O
🤷‍♀️ O
you O
seem O
normal! O
[SEP]
After O
the O
immigration O
to O
New O
Zealand O
stuff O
coming O
out O
I've O
personally O
decided O
against O
it. O
Not O
that O
that's O
in O
the O
plans O
at O
all, O
but O
I'm O
sure O
there O
are O
many O
more O
ableist O
policies O
we O
don't O
know O
about. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
I O
need O
accommodations O
I O
think O
any O
company O
that O
requires O
proof O
instead O
of O
just O
listening O
to O
me O
isn't O
really O
something O
I O
want O
to O
support. O
Though O
if O
it's O
for O
official O
reasons O
and O
not O
a O
reflection O
of O
the O
employer O
themselves, O
I O
have O
my O
adhd O
diagnosis O
that O
I O
can O
use. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Idk, O
just O
seems O
like O
the O
world O
is O
against O
us O
no O
matter O
what O
we O
do, O
we O
just O
get O
to O
pick O
the O
flavour O
of O
discrimination. O
[SEP]
This O
happened O
with O
a O
weird O
number O
of O
parents O
at O
the O
school O
I O
used O
to O
teach O
at. O
Refusing O
to O
let O
their O
kids O
access O
help O
and O
resources O
but O
only O
about O
autism O
and O
adhd. O
Depression O
and O
other O
mental O
health O
was O
helped O
with, O
but O
not O
these. O
So O
much O
ableism. O
You O
don't O
need O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
to O
say O
you O
are O
autistic O
in O
my O
opinion, O
if O
you've O
really O
looked O
into O
it O
and O
the O
words O
"autism O
resources O
have O
saved O
my O
life" O
sounds O
like O
you O
have. O
I O
have O
a O
diagnosis O
and O
I O
think O
it's O
gatekeeping O
bullshit O
and O
I O
was O
only O
able O
to O
access O
those O
services O
when O
telehealth O
exploded O
thanks O
to O
COVID. O
Since O
things O
like O
parents, O
bias, O
money, O
health O
insurance, O
lack O
of O
resources, O
racism, O
sexism, O
all O
make O
the O
system O
ineffective O
and O
inequitable, O
and O
traumatizing, O
requiring O
someone O
to O
go O
through O
that O
system O
to O
have O
an O
outsider O
judge O
their O
inner O
experience O
and O
life O
is O
morally O
wrong, O
in O
my O
opinion. O
Does O
that O
mean O
maybe O
sometimes O
people O
will O
claim O
they're O
autistic O
and O
not O
be? O
Yeah. O
Yes, O
absolutely, O
people O
will O
be O
wrong O
and O
incorrectly O
diagnose O
sometimes. O
I O
don't O
care, O
because O
the O
alternative O
is O
more O
autistic O
people O
suffering O
without O
resources O
and O
validation, O
which O
is O
what O
we O
have O
now O
and O
it O
sucks. O
We O
have O
rampant O
misdiagnosis O
and O
prejudice O
by O
out-of-date O
'experts'. O
It's O
a O
mess. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
need O
what O
resources O
are O
being O
kept O
away O
from O
you, O
then O
you O
can O
decide O
if O
you O
want O
to O
wade O
into O
the O
morass. O
But O
if O
you O
want O
one O
for O
permission O
to O
recognize O
your O
identity O
and O
your O
needs? O
You O
don't O
need O
one, O
you're O
autistic, O
and O
you O
already O
sound O
like O
you O
are O
on O
the O
right O
path O
to O
understanding O
that O
and O
finding O
resources. O

My O

I’m B-Health

even I-Health

I I-Health

the O

a O

[SEP]
Self-diagnosis O
is O
valid! O
I O
know O
it’s O
hard O
with O
doubting O
parents, O
but O
my O

knows O
the O
inner O
workings O
of O
my O
mind O
and O
body O
about O
as O
well O
as O
I O
know O
hers O
(not O
at O
all). O
Parents O
think O
they O
know O
more O
than O
they O
do O
about O
their O
children, O
so O
just O
remember O
that O
you O
know O
yourself O
better O
than O
your O
parents. O
My B-Family
dad I-Family
(who I-Family
is I-Family
probably I-Family
also I-Family
autistic) I-Family
scored O
me O
a O

higher O
on O
the O
parent O
questionnaire O
from O
the O
doctor O
who O
assessed O
me O
than O
my O

did; O
just O
shows O
that O
what O
is O
visible O
on O
the O
outside O
can O
be O
interpreted O
differently O

who O

[SEP]
You O

your O

If O

you O

is O
no O

yourself O

before O
you O

that O
should O
change O
in O

You O
are O
totally O
right O
that O
doctors O
can O
be O
rude O
and O
invalidating. O
Many O
do O
not O
seem O
to O
keep O
up O
with O

in O
their O

have O
outdated O

and O
honestly, O
both O
general O

we O

a O

a O

Without O

it O

I O
suspected O
I O

I O
was O

12. O
I've O
been O
through O
the O

thing O
with O
being O
bullied O
in O

I O
could O
never O

why O
because O
I O
was O
just O
being O
myself. O
One O
of O
my O
teachers O
I O
think O
could O
kinda O
tell, O
and O
she O
was O
so O
kind O
to O
me. O
She O
was O
like O
a O

she O
would O
tell O
me O
all O

[SEP]
Since O
her O
diagnosis O
9 O
years O
I've O
been O
educating O
myself O
about O
autism O
and O
women O
with O
autism. O
About O
3 O
years O
ago O
it O
finally O
started O
to O
click O
for O
me. O
Sooo O
many O
things O
began O
to O
make O
sense. O
All O
the O
things O
that O
were O
hard O
for O
me O
growing O
up, O
people O
thinking O
I O
was O
"weird", O
the O
social O
difficulties O
I've O
had O
(and O
still O
have), O
the O
way O
I O
was O
speech O
delayed O
(I O
thought O
it O
was O
because O
of O
the O
extreme O
strife O
going O
on O
at O
home). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Anyway. O
I O
still O
don't O
know O
if O
I O
will O
seek O
an O
official O
diagnosis. O
I O
hear O
such O
horror O
stories O
about O
practitioners O
who O
don't O
know O
shit O
about O
autism O
but O
are O
somehow O
allowed O
to O
diagnose O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Long O
story O
short, O
I O
feel O
you O
and O
I O
wish O
you O
happiness. O
❤️ O
[SEP]
Self O
diagnosis O
is O
valid. O
And O
I'm O
so O
glad O
you've O
figure O
it O
out O
at O
your O
age. O
How O
I O
wish O
autism O
was O
even O
on O
my O
radar O
when O
I O
was O
19. O
Unfortunately, O
like O
most O
people, O
my O
understanding O
of O
autism O
was O
limited. O
But O
then O
again, O
it's O
only O
been O
recently O
that O
we've O
had O
more O
studies O
done O
and O
have O
understood O
it O
better, O
especially O
how O
it O
displays O
itself O
in O
women. O
[SEP]
You're O
on O
the O
right O
track! O
[SEP]
it's O
a O
shame O
that O
ableism O
and O
internalised O
ableism O
prevent O
people O
from O
seeking O
a O
diagnosis O
but O
it O
is O
a O
very O
real O
problem. O
if O
you O
don't O
want O
a O
diagnosis O
that's O
okay, O
you're O
more O
than O
okay O
to O
say O
you O
suspect O
you're O
autistic O
and O
to O
inform O
whoever O
you O
want O
so O
that O
they O
can O
help O
you O
better O
[SEP]
[SEP]
a O
diagnosis O
can O
be O
very O
helpful O
but O
depending O
on O
where O
you O
live O
and O
your O
personal O
life O
it O
could O
unfortunately O
also O
negatively O
affect O
you. O
do O
not O
feel O
you O
have O
to O
'decide' O
now. O
autism O
doesn't O
go O
away O
so O
if O
you O
find O
yourself O
wanting O
a O
diagnosis O
in O
the O
future O
that's O
okay O
too! O
if O
you O
find O
you O
don't O
need O
the O
accommodations O
or O
it O
will O
hinder O
you O
then O
don't O
feel O
you O
need O
to O
get O
one, O
after O
all O
you're O
allowed O
to O
say O
you O
suspect O
you're O
autistic O
or O
you O
have O
autistic O
traits, O
there's O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
that O
[SEP]
Well, O
you O
could O
wait O
a O
bit O
and O
decide O
later! O
I’m O
2x O
as O
old O
as O
you O
are, O
and O
I’m O
just O
doing O
it O
now. O
But O
do O
consider O
doing O
it O
at O
some O
point O
so O
you O
can O
get O
support O
or O
financial O
benefits O
if O
you O
need O
them O
in O
the O

[SEP]
Self O
diagnosis O
is O
valid. O
I O
did O
get O
officially O
diagnosed, O
but O
despite O
having O
a O
decent O
career, O
I O
may O
need O
accommodations. O
I O
haven't O
officially O
disclosed O
my O
diagnosis, O
but O
if O
they O
take O
away O
our O
telework O
days O
I O
would O
take O
my O
diagnostic O
assessment O
from O
my O
psychologist O
that O
recommended O
less O

more O
telework. O

I O

am O
fortunate O
that O
I O
can O
consider O
this O

I O
know O
it's O
not O
possible O

I O
can O

embrace O

engage O

and O
have O

[SEP]
I've O
strongly O
suspected O
for O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
that O
I O
have O
autism, O
but O
I O
don't O
want O
a O
formal O
diagnosis. O
The O
reasons O
are: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
\- O
I B-Location
live I-Location
in I-Location
the I-Location
US I-Location
and O
a O
diagnosis O
is O
really O
expensive, O
even O
with O
health O
insurance O
[SEP]
[SEP]
\- O
It O
seems O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
psychiatrists O
that O
have O
an O
outdated O
view O
of O
autism, O
especially O
autism O
in O
women O
or O
any O
traits O
that O
don't O
fit O
the O
Rain O
Man O
sort O
of O
stereotypes, O
and O
don't O
want O
someone O
uninformed O
invalidating O
my O
experience O
[SEP]
[SEP]
\- O
My O
therapist O
is O
an O
autistic O
woman O
who O
specializes O
in O
autism O
and O
agrees O
that O
I'm O
autistic O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
have O
plenty O
of O
time O
to O
get O
diagnosed O
if O
you O
want O
to. O
Many O
people O
get O
diagnosed O
later O
in O
life, O
even O
in O
middle O
age O
or O
old O
age. O
The O
actor O
Anthony O
Hopkins O
got O
diagnosed O
in O
his O
70s. O
I'd O
say O
take O
it O
slow O
and O
don't O
do O
anything O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
just O
because O
of O
societal O
pressure O
or O
ignorant O
people O
who O
look O
down O
on O
self O
diagnosis. O
[SEP]
You O
don’t O
have O
to O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
if O
you O
don’t O
want O
to! O
There’s O
not O
a O
massive O
benefit O
to O
having O
an O
autism O
diagnosis O
in O
the O
UK, O
because O
it O
doesn’t O
get O
you O
any O
help O
or O
medication O
whereas O
an O
ADHD O
assessment O
lets O
you O
get O
access O
to O
medication. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
lot O
of O
professionals O
are O
also O
pretty O
late O
to O
the O
autism O
research O
party. O
They O
still O
think O
to O
be O
autistic O
you O
have O
to O
be O
an O
non O
verbal O
boy O
who O
is O
aggressive. O
You O
could O
end O
up O
getting O
assessed O
by O
an O
old O
school O
psych O
who O
might O
end O
up O
invalidating O
you O
and O
making O
you O
feel O
worse. O
Self O
diagnosis O
is O
valid O
in O
the O
autistic O
community, O
I O
work O
in O
mental O
health O
and O
we O
assume O
anyone O
referred/asked O
for O
an O
assessment O
has O
autism O
because O
it’s O
very O
hard O
to O
get O
an O
assessment O
on O
the O
NHS, O
so O
self O
diagnosis O
is O
also O
valid O
in O
healthcare O
settings O
too. O
I O
think O
as O
long O
as O
you O
know O
yourself O
and O
you’re O
happy O
to O
not O
have O
a O
professional O
confirm O
it O
for O
you O
then O
I O
think O
you O
should O
use O
the O
autism O
label O
if O
you O
feel O
it O
fits O
you! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
NHS O
psychiatrist O
diagnosed O
me O
but O
he’s O
not O
a O
neurodevelopmental O
specialist O
so O
I O
still O
need O
an O
“official O
assessment.” O
I’m O
not O
going O
to O
bother O
because O
it O
won’t O
get O
me O
anything O
extra. O
In O
fact O
during O
COVID O
our O
government O
used O
having O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
autism/any O
major O
disability O
like O
Down O
syndrome O
as O
a O
reason O
to O
stop O
disabled O
people O
getting O
ventilators. O
I’m O
also O
assuming O
in O
the O
US O
or O
any O
other O
insurance O
based O
country O
having O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
could O
make O
your O
insurance O
more O
expensive? O
[SEP]
I O
feel O
the O
same O
way. O
I O
function O
with O
support O
and O
fortunate O
circumstances O
[SEP]
Personally O
I O
see O
no O
need O
for O
a O
medical O
diagnosis O
unless O
it O
is O
necessary O
for O
government O
aid. O
What O
I O
DO O
suggest O
is O
finding O
a O
good O
therapist O
who O
is O
also O
ND/Autistic O
to O
help O
you O
navigate O
a O
world O
built O
for O
neurotypicals. O
My O
life O
has O
been O
made O
infinitely O
easier O
for O
mine! O
[SEP]
I O
am O
self O
diagnosed. O
My O
father O
was O
diagnosed O
late O
in O
life. O
I O
started O
suspecting O
that O
I O
was O
when O
he O
received O
his O
diagnosis. O
My O
confirmation O
came O
when O
my O
daughter O
was O
up O
for O
an O
updated O
eval O
for O
her O
adhd O
diagnosis. O
The O
doctor O
removed O
her O
adhd O
diagnosis O
and O
diagnosed O
autism. O
When O
the O
doctor O
was O
going O
through O
her O
autistic O
traits O
I O
could’ve O
cried. O
One O
because O
I O
always O
knew O
she O
was O
autistic O
and O
two O
because O
all O
of O
the O
listed O
traits O
are O
traits O
my O
daughter O
shares O
with O
me. O
[SEP]
A O
lot O
of O
the O
signs O
of O
autism O
are O
also O
signs O
of O
other O
neurological O
conditions. O
ADHD O
and O
schizophrenia O
as O
2 O
examples. O
Find O
a O
psychologist O
you O
click O
with O
and O
work O
through O
things O
with O
them O
to O
get O
an O
outside O
opinion O
[SEP]
The O
amount O
of O
times O
I’ve O
been O
told O
“really? O
I O
would O
have O
never O
guessed” O
by O
people O
I’ve O
told O
about O
my O
diagnosis, O
it’s O
happened O
so O
many O
times. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
don't O
want O
a O
diagnosis, O
that's O
entirely O
your O
choice. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
me O
personally, O
it O
was O
a O
relief. O
But O
I O
can O
see O
where O
it O
could O
make O
things O
more O
difficult O
for O
me, O
too. O
But O
that's O
okay. O
I'll O
get O
to O
where O
I O
need O
to O
be. O
Whatever O
your O
choice O
is, O
it's O
completely O
valid, O
and O
you're O
welcome O
to O
be O
here O
as O
a O
fellow O
autist O
with O
or O
without O
diagnosis O
:) O
[SEP]
Self-diagnosis O
is O
absolutely O
valid O
& O
is O
supported. O
I’m O
formally O

I O
wish O
I O
never O

I O
experienced O

even O

suspected O
I O

for O
almost O
10 O

And O
moreso O
the O
experiences O
of O
being O
autistic O
have O
strongly O
resonated O
with O
me O

Curious- O
how O
is O
moving O
to O
another O
country O
limited O
by O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
of O
autism? O
Also, O
are O
autistic O
adults O
not O
allowed O
to O
adopt O
in O
the O
U.S.? O
[SEP]
Same O
I B-Family
noticed I-Family
my I-Family
parents I-Family
have I-Family
autistic I-Family
traits I-Family
as I-Family
well. I-Family
Like O
they O
always O
get O
the O
weird O
stares O
at O
dinner O
parties… O
and O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
bad O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
think O
being O
autistic O
is O
all O
about O
being O
and O
acting O
weird. O
Our O
daughter O
is O
actually O
more O
normal O
than O
most O
children O
her O
age, O
I’m O
guessing O
you O
could O
say O
that’s O
strange! O
She O
can O
seem O
a O
bit O
aloof O
and O
watches O
them O
and O
shakes O
her O
head O
watching O
many O
children. O
[SEP]
When O
I O
talk O
with O
my O
daughter O
she O
is O
eloquent O
and O
smart O
and O
seems O
very O
normal. O
I O
think O
it’s O
many O
times O
about O
autistic O
people O
understanding O
themselves O
in O
a O
world O
that O
seems O
very O
weird O
[SEP]
Wow, O
that O
got O
quite O
dark. O
It's O
not O
who O
I O
usually O
am O
but O
idk O
the O
topic O
just O
gets O
to O
me O
[SEP]
Our O
child O
is O
amazing, O
we O
now O
know O
she O
is O
autistic O
because O
we O
took O
an O
interest O
in O
finding O
out O
what O
autism O
truly O
was O
in O
girls O
and O
women. O
I O
was O
very O
dismissive O
of O
her O
initial O
cry’s O
for O
help O
because O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
autism O
was O
but O
she O
did O
as O
an O
11 O
year O
old O
girl. O
It’s O
all O
about O
the O
research O
daddy O
😂 O
we O
now O
understand O
researching O
is O
part O
of O
her O
autism. O
We B-Location
live I-Location
in I-Location
the I-Location
uk I-Location
and O
the O
help O
you O
can O
get O
here O
is O
non O
existent, O
in O
fact O
it’s O
so O
backwards O
you O
have O
to O
fight O
for O
any O
recognition. O
We O
are O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
into O
self O
diagnosing O
her O
autism O
and O
we O
have O
another O
two O
years O
waiting O
for O
an O
official O
stamp. O
[SEP]
Our O
gp O
said O
my O
daughter O
can’t O
be O
autistic O
because O
she O
looked O
him O
in O
the O
eyes O
😂 O
we O
spent O
many O
hours O
teaching O
her O
to O
look O
at O
peoples O
shoulders O
or O
just O
above O
the O
head O
[SEP]
The O
main O
thing O
preventing O
me O
is O
my O
fear O
of O
having O
a O
traumatic O
experience O
with O
the O
doctor O
doing O
my O
assessment. O
I O
have O
had O
very O
traumatic O
medical O
situations O
before. O
I O
will O
try O
to O
work O
that O
idea O
in O
my O
mind O
and O
see O
when O
I O
feel O
ready. O
Because O
I O
do O
want O
to O
get O
an O
assessment O
done, O
I O
am O
just O
scared. O
Thank O
you. O

[SEP]
I O
100% O

it’s O

to O
hear O
a O
medical O
professional O
agreeing! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
An O
autism O
diagnosis O
via O
NHS O
in O
U.K. O
got O
me O
the O
following: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Access O
to O
disability O
support O
services O
which O
is O
a O
lovely O
lady O
that O
came O
and O
essentially O
fixed O
my O
life O
(I O
had O
debt O
and O
calls/letters O
that O
needing O
chasing, O
she O
sorted O
it O
all), O
[SEP]
Access O
to O
PiP O
which O
gives O
me O
an O
extra O
£500 O
per O
month O
none O
means O
tested O
to O
make O
life O
a O
little O
easier, O
[SEP]
Access O
to O
long O
term O
disability O
benefits O
if O
I O
find O
myself O
out O
of O
work O
(don’t O
need O
it O
rn O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
ASD O
end O
up O
without O
work), O
[SEP]
Free O
and O
easy O
access O
to O
an O
NHS O
dentist O
(there’s O
a O
community O
care O
dentist O
in O
every O
major O
city O
that O
you O
have O
to O
be O
disabled O
to O
access), O
[SEP]
Easier O
access O
to O
therapies O
tailored O
to O
ASD O
and O
also O
medications O
(I’m O
given O
argument O
free O
diazepam O
to O
use O
when O
I O
see O
fit O
whereas O
that’s O
usually O
difficult O
to O
obtain, O
I O
use O
it O
sparingly O
for O
high O
anxiety O
situ), O
[SEP]
Priority O
register O
with O
energy O
companies O
so O
if O
the O
power O
goes O
out O
I O
get O
it O
back O
quickly/if O
works O
are O
planned O
I O
get O
advanced O
notice O
etc O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
may O
not O
need O
any O
of O
that O
but O
I O
think O
it’s O
really O
important O
that O
people O
know O
that O
that’s O
available O
to O
them. O
I O
honestly O
need O
some O
of O
that O
but O
I O
think O
my O
son O
is O
getting O
the O
real O
benefit. O
He’s O
14, O
diagnosed O
at O
10 O
and O
wow, O
I O
got O
him O
an O
EHCP O
(education O
healthcare O
plan) O
with O
the O
local O
council O
so O
he O
gets: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
placement O
at O
a O
local O
ASD O
school O
with O
12 O
kids O
per O
class O
and O
4 O
teachers O
(wtf O
right?!), O
[SEP]
No O
bullying O
ever O
cus O
his O
schoolmates O
are O
like O
him O
and O
omg O
did O
I O
mention O
the O
12 O
kids O
per O
class?! O
That O
place O
is O
Hogwarts, O
[SEP]
Access O
to O
PiP O
also O
which O
is O
around O
£450 O
per O
month O
rn O
and O
will O
increase O
and O
be O
paid O
to O
him O
direct O
when O
he O
turns O
16 O
regardless O
of O
income, O
[SEP]
Advanced O
support O
on O
the O
transition O
from O
school O
to O
college O
including O
an O
offered O
placement O
at O
an O
ASD O
college O
which O
has O
lines O
of O
ASD O
friendly O
businesses O
connected O
waiting O
to O
employ O
them, O
[SEP]
Extensive O
support O
when O
he O
chooses O
to O
join O
university O
(the O
list O
I O
saw O
was O
crazy, O
from O
extra O
financial O
aid, O
free O
computers O
and O
extra O
time O
for O
tests), O
[SEP]
Lastly O
he’ll O
have O
the O
supports O
I O
have O
but O
getting O
all O
this O
support O
early O
really O
gives O
him O
a O
leg O
up O
[SEP]
My O
psychotherapist O
who O
I've O
been O
with O
for O
a O
few O
years O
now O
alerted O
me O
to O
being O
autistic O
recently, O
and O
from O
there O
everything O
has O
fallen O
into O
place O
and O
it's O
been O
a O
journey O
of O
self O
acceptance O
to O
say O
the O
least. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
an O
NHS O
assessment O
but O
the O
wait O
is O
over O
18 O
months O
and O
going O
private O
costs O
2K, O
but O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
am O
less O
valid O
in O
people's O
eyes O
if O
I O
don't O
have O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
(also O
imposter O
syndrome), O
so O
I O
am O
probably O
going O
to O
fork O
out O
the O
money. O
It O
sucks. O
[SEP]
No O
I O
didn't O
silence O
anything. O
I O
routinely O
paste O
this O
link O
because O
reddit O
population O
is O
so O
changing, O
new O
people O
are O
here O
every O
hour, O
I O
suspect. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
it O
is O
really O
important O
that O
a O
major O
USA O
uni O
is O
taking O
this O
stance. O
[SEP]
So? O
[SEP]
There O
was O
a O
thread O
this O
week O
about O
how O
an O
autism O
diagnosis O
can O
limit O
immigration O
- O
a O
lot O
of O
"developed" O
countries O
consider O
autism O
a O
reason O
to O
reject O
your O
application. O
I O
was O
specifically O
interested O
in O
Australia O
- O
apparently O
they O
rejected O
a O
kid O
bc O
of O
their O
autism, O
but O
gave O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
kid's O
family O
entry, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
bc O
of O
international O
outrage O
that O
the O
kid O
was O
accepted. O
So O
yeah, O
any O
musings O
about O
official O
diagnosis O
have O
officially O
gone O
out O
the O
window O
for O
me O
:') O
[SEP]
There O
was O
a O
post O
about O
this O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago, O
specifically O
about O
New O
Zealand. O
I O
think O
it O
was O
here O
but O
I'm O
not O
100% O
sure. O
Sorry, O
I O
don't O
feel O
like O
fishing O
for O
it O
right O
now, O
but O
yeah, O
sadly O
not O
BS. O
Certain O
countries, O
certain O
states O
have O
these O
restrictions. O
[SEP]
Yeah O
weird O
isn't O
quite O
the O
right O
word O
but O
she O
told O
me O
doctor O
there O
was O
absolutely O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
in O
any O
way O
about O
me. O
Like O
she O
couldn't O
come O
up O
with O
anything O
at O
all O
that O
might O
interest O
him. O
Which O
doesn't O
make O
sense O
because O
she O
told O
me O
plenty O
of O
stories O
of O
my O
behavior O
as O
a O
child O
that O
seemed O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
to O
me. O
Her O
favorite O
thing O
to O
describe O
me O
as O
was O
"an O
old O
soul" O
because O
of O
how O
unchildlike O
I O
acted, O
and O
she O
did O
not O
mention O
that O
at O
all O
to O
the O
doctor. O
[SEP]
No O
of O
course O
I’m O
glad O
you O
commented O
because O
I O
didn’t O
know O
that O
was O
all O
available! O
Like O
at O
all??? O
I’m O
actually O
in O
shock!! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
well O
aware O
that O
getting O
diagnosed O
as O
early O
as O
possible O
for O
children O
is O
so O
important O
as O
that O
obviously O
unlocks O
support O
in O
schools O
etc O
so O
if O
OP O
wasn’t O
already O
an O
adult O
I’d O
have O
100% O
suggested O
going O
for O
an O
assessment. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
in O
the O
NHS O
trust O
I O
work O
for O
there O
doesn’t O
seem O
to O
be O
anything O
available O
to O
those O
who O
have O
level O
one/mild O
severity O
autism. O
As O
the O
NHS O
diagnosed O
me O
it’s O
just O
not O
from O
the O
“official” O
autism O
psychiatrist, O
it O
is O
on O
my O
notes O
and O
things O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
basically O
treated O
as O
if O
I O
have O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
as O
my O
GP, O
LMHT, O
crisis O
team O
etc O
all O
recognises O
it. O
As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
professionally O
and O
what O
I O
have O
been O
offered O
there’s O
nothing O
in O
terms O
of O
massive O
support O
network O
or O
therapy O
offered O
which O
is O
tailored O
to O
ASD. O
Any O
clients, O
both O
on O
the O
wards O
and O
in O
the O
community O
with O
ASD O
have O
only O
been O
offered O
CBT O
which O
isn’t O
great O
for O
ND O
people. O
I O
applied O
for O
PIP O
and O
was O
awarded O
enhanced O
rates O
for O
ASD O
despite O
not O
having O
an O
“official” O
diagnosis O
so O
I O
have O
that O
but O
other O
than O
that O
I O
haven’t O
seen O
any O
benefits. O
My O
LMHT O
told O
me O
the O
neurodevelopmental O
special O
services O
in O
my O
city O
offer O
support O
once O
diagnosed O
but O
when O
I O
spoke O
to O
them O
they O
told O
me O
they O
do O
the O
assessment O
and O
discharge O
you O
without O
further O
support. O
Unless O
you O
have O
ADHD O
and O
they O
will O
keep O
you O
on O
through O
medication O
titration. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
dentist O
thing O
has O
especially O
blown O
my O
mind! O
I’m O
terrified O
of O
the O
dentist O
and O
have O
only O
had O
one O
procedure O
without O
full O
on O
sedation. O
I O
asked O
both O
my O
LMHT O
and O
my O
dentist O
if O
there O
is O
a O
service O
for O
people O
with O
autism O
and O
sensory O
issues O
to O
get O
sedation O
done O
quicker/free O
and O
I O
was O
told O
there’s O
nothing! O
I O
even O
posted O
in O
the O
DWP O
Reddit O
asking O
if O
PIP O
allows O
you O
access O
to O
dental O
surgeries O
and O
everyone O
said O
not O
really O
no. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
actually O
shocked! O
In O
work O
we O
help O
people O
apply O
for O
PIP O
and O
such O
and O
that’s O
all O
we O
suggest O
other O
than O
a O
referral O
to O
adult O
social O
care. O
I O
guess O
it O
really O
is O
an O
NHS/social O
care O
lottery. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
glad O
you O
have O
got O
so O
much O
out O
of O
the O
diagnosis O
and O
it’s O
allowed O
you O
to O
set O
up O
things O
for O
your O
son. O
I O
genuinely O
didn’t O
think O
it O
did O
much O
because O
where O
I O
am O
it O
really O
doesn’t O
seem O
to! O

ETA: O
I’ve O
been O
prescribed O
diazepam O
for O
stressful O
life O
events O
a O
few O
times O
but O
that O
was O
all O
pre O
diagnosis. O
As O
far O
as O
I’m O
aware O
and O
from O
what O
my O
psych O
said O
there’s O
no O
meds O
specifically O
for O
autism O
and O
wouldn’t O
prescribe O
anything O
for O
my O
intense O
anxiety O
😟 O
[SEP]
I O
so O
get O
you, O
I O
do O
really O
struggle O
with O
imposter O
syndrome O
too. O
I O
have O
to O
regularly O
look O
at O
my O
clinic O
letter O
from O
my O
psychology O
where O
it O
says O
I O
have O
“probable O
autism O
of O
mild O
severity” O
under O
my O
working O
diagnosis. O
I’ve O
just O
put O
the O
deposit O
down O
for O
a O
private O
ADHD O
assessment O
because O
although O
my O
psychiatrist O
thinks O
I O
have O
it, O
as O
they’re O
not O
working O
for O
the O
neurodevelopmental O
service O
and O
they’re O
controlled O
drugs O
he O
can’t O
prescribe O
the O
medication O
for O
me O
and O
I O
didn’t O
want O
to O
wait. O
So O
deffo O
understand O
your O
pain. O
Just O
remember O
you’re O
valid O
even O
if O
one O
day O
they O
assess O
you O
and O
for O
some O
reason O
you O
don’t O
get O
the O
diagnosis! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Still O
apply O
for O
PIP O
though O
with O
autism O
as O
a O
diagnosis! O
I B-Health
was I-Health
awarded I-Health
PIP I-Health
for I-Health
my I-Health
autism I-Health
with O
just O
that O
letter O
and O
you O
could O
put O
your O
psychotherapist O
down O
and O
they O
can O
contact O
them O
for O
clarification. O

I O

to O
much O
about O
the O
doctors, O
from O
my O
experience O
they O
don’t O
seem O
to O
be O
to O

My O
ex O
was O
a O
gp O
and O
a O
surgeon O
and O
she O
told O
me O
never O
trust O
the O
word O
of O
a O
doctor. O
I O
think O
that O
speaks O
volumes O
😂 O
[SEP]
I’m O
so O
glad O
you O
help O
people O
apply O
for O
PiP. O
That O
thing O
is O
life O
changing O
and O
so O
damn O
hard O
to O
get O
without O
a O
professional O
to O
help O
and O
validate O
your O
claim. O
I O
hope O
you O
know O
how O
appreciated O
that O
is, O
I O
was O
nervous O
about O
being O
weird O
when O
my O
nurse O
hooked O
me O
up O
but O
I O
wanted O
to O
cry O
and O
hug O
her! O
[SEP]

I O

wondering O
if O
it’s O
an O

the O

it O
is O
an O

I’m O
amazed O
you O
can O
get O
PiP O
that’s O
awesome!! O
I O
honestly O
thought O
you O
had O
to O
have O
a O
concrete O
diagnosis O
cus O
they O
had O
me O
show O
them O
our O
papers O
when O
I O
applied, O
thank O
you O
for O
that O
I O
know O
a O

I’ve O

a O

cus O
it’s O
not O
like O
they’re O
going O
to O
ask O
to O
see O
your O
papers O
so O
I O
always O
tell O
autistic O
peeps O
I O
know O
to O
just O
say O
they O
are O
if O
self O
diagnosed O
as O
they’ll O
still O
have O

won’t O
due O

questions O
are: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
much O
of O
your O
arm/ O
leg O
do O
you O
need O
to O
cover, O
e.g. O
are O
three-quarter O
sleeves O
ok? O
Is O
exposing O
your O
feet O
(as O
in, O
by O
wearing O
sandals) O
ok? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Is O
visible O
jewellery O
okay? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
your O
face O
looks O
prettier O
than O
an O
average O
person's O
face, O
to O
the O
point O
where O
it O
can O
attract O
attention O
on O
its O
own, O
is O
this O
tabarruj? O
[SEP]
The O
minimum O
is O
that O
the O
whole O
body O
needs O
to O
be O
covered O
up, O
including O
feet, O
except O
for O
the O
face/hands O
(even O
though O
there O
is O
a O
difference O
of O
opinion O
about O
niqab, O
which O
I O
should O
point O
out). O
So O
three O
quarter O
sleeves O
and O
showing O
your O
feet O
do O
not O
meet O
the O
criteria. O

something O

even O

The O
same O
thing O
happens O
to O
me. O
The O
problem O
is O
that O
I B-Health
have I-Health
a I-Health
slight I-Health
hearing I-Health
loss I-Health
since B-Time
I I-Time
was I-Time
little I-Time
and, O
since O
I O
started O
daydreaming, O
I O
couldn't O
stop O
putting O
my O
headphones O
on O
withthe O
music O
at O
maximum O
volume O
and O
that O
is O
very O
dangerous O
for O
me. O
I O
haven't O
lost O
more O
hearing, O
but O
I O
started O
to O
hear O
a O
ringing O
in O
my O
ear O
that O
I O
think O
is O
tinnitus. O
It O
has O
been O
very O
hard O
for O
me, O
but O
every O
time O
I O
try O
to O
resist O
and O
turn O
down O
the O
volume O
of O
the O
music, O
but O
sometimes O
I O
put O
the O
music O
at O
maximus O
volume O
again, O
but O
now O
it O
doesn't O
happen O
that O
much. O
I O
have O
the O
same O
fear O
you O
have O
because O
I'm O
also O
a O
teenager O
and O
I O
love O
music O
and O
I O
can't O
live O
without O
it. O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
advice O
I O
could O
give O
you, O
but O
I O
sometimes O
try O
to O
hide O
my O
headphones O
to O
avoid O
picking O
them O
up, O
but O
I O
know O
it's O
really O
hard. O
Also O
I O
think O
other O
thing O
that O
helped O
me O
was O
watching O
the O
movie O
Sound O
of O
Metal O
which O
made O
me O
realize O
that O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
doing O
that. O

you O
go O

out O

Think O
it’s O
out O

until O

outdoor O

It's O
the O

under O

on O
the O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Quality O
is O
a O
stretch. O
It's O
decent. O
It's O
a O
passable O
ounce, O
reasonable O
quality O
at O
its O
price. O
[SEP]
That's O
the O
half O
oz O
price. O
[SEP]
Wish O
I O
could. O
I O
unfortunately O
live O
in O
a O

Tried O
growing O
outdoor O
a O
couple O

it O
was O

a O
bust. O

[SEP]
Berry O
Smasher! O
I O
have O

Edit: O
the O
only O
dispensary O
near O
me O
that O
had O
it O
was O
closed O
when O
I O
got O
there O
so O
I O
hit O
up O
a O
Value O
Buds O
(gross, O
I O
know) O
and O
grabbed O
two O
half O
oz’s O
of O
Red O
Fatso O
from O
Doja. O
Definitely O
spent O
more O
than O
I O
wanted, O
but O
I’m O
feelin’ O
preeetttty O
glonky O
right O
now. O
[SEP]
Bought O
the O
Berry O
Smasher O
120 O
plus O
tax O
and O
found O
it O
alot O
better O
than O
the O
cheaper O
100 O
dollar O
ounces O
Ive O
been O
smoking. O
[SEP]
Can O
confirm O
Berry O
Smasher O
is O
pretty O
good. O
A O
little O
larfy O
(well O
more O
“airy”) O
but O
very O
good O
stuff O
for O
the O
price. O
I O
too O
got O
sick O
of O
BBOB O
Pink O
Kush O
(and O
I O
loved O
it O
at O
first O
- O
the O
strain O
quickly O
loses O

for O
me O
as O
I O
work O
through O

[SEP]
This. O

Low O

I’ve O

gross, O
dry, O
kernels O

pink O

I’ve O
tried O
most O
of O
their O

my O
point O
is O
that O
the O
consistency O
is O
way O
off. O
[SEP]
pink O
cookies O
from O

overly O

I O
work O

My O

I'm O

[SEP]
Pink O
Cookies, O
but O
to O
be O
honest O
I'm O
off O
the O
BBOB O
wagon. O
The O
last O

bags O
I O
got O
were O
VERY O
harsh. O
The O
quality O
just O
isn't O
there. O

For O

you O
the O

for O

[SEP]
How O
is O
it?? O
How O
does O
it O
compare O
to O
Pink O
Cookies? O
[SEP]
True, O
but O
the O
average O
(good/fire) O
ounce O
shouldn’t O
be O
$180+. O
If O
you’re O
talking O
about O
quads/quads+ O
then O
I O
understand. O
But, O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
bud O
at O
110-120 O
could O
be O
lowered. O
It’s O
because O
of O
the O
major O
overhead O
the O
companies O
have O
(employees, O
buildings, O
taxes, O
licenses, O
etc). O
They’re O
for O
profit, O
so O
if O
they O
can O
squeeze O
$10 O
out O
of O
you O
they O
will. O

[SEP]
Testing O

would O
say O
your O
wrong. O
The O
THC O

are O
roughly O
the O

they O
are O
growing O

don’t O

Aka O
the O

why O

then O
of O

there’s O
absolute O

lol. O
But O
I’d O
rather O
order O
from O
a O
high O

chad O
then O
smoke O
PSF O
any O

I O
understand O
some O
people O
are O
willing O
to O
compromise O
on O
quality O
and O
value O
by O
settling O
for O
the O
low-end O
legal O
offerings O
because O
it O
feels O
safer O
to O
them, O
but O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
seasoned O
smokers O
that O
stuff O
just O
doesn’t O
cut O
it. O

Then O
why O
you O

if O

Sugarbud O

are O
all O
craft O
growers O
with O
much O
much O
better O

even O

they're O
not O
technically O

[SEP]
Me O
too. O
I O
love O

my O

what O

want, O
especially O
after O

When O
you O

the O

small O
AMPCR O

it’s O
no O
wonder O
the O
results O
are O
so O
awesome. O
[SEP]
Actually, O
it’s O
about O
the O
same O
from O
legal O
to O
illegal O
markets. O
Some O
companies O
had O
lied O
to O
Health O
Canada O
about O
what O
they O
were O
using O
and O
hid O
them O
from O
Health O
Canada O
during O
inspections. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Honestly, O
the O
best O
way O
to O
go O
if O
you O
can, O
growing O
yourself. O
[SEP]
If O
what O
they're O
producing O
is O
*so O
good,* O
why O
haven't O
they O
gone O
legit O
and O
scaled O
up O
production? O
Red O

🤷🏼‍♂️ O
[SEP]
No O
one O
is O
agreeing O
with O
you, O
its O

[SEP]
The O

is O
the O
end O
all O
be O
all O
to O
what O
gets O
put O
on O
the O

[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
they O
decided O
that O
LPs O
couldn't O
sell O
products O
that O
didn't O
have O
accurate O
cannabinoid/terp O

and O
created O
more O
standardized O
government O
run O

everything O
would O
change O
for O
the O
better O
in O
a O
heartbeat. O
[SEP]
Government O
in O
the O
end O
is O
to O
blame. O
They O
could O
make O
stricter O
rules/regulations O
for O
LP’s/labs O
for O

Can O
also O
have O
more O
random O

The O

made O
the O

[SEP]
🤣 O

More O
so O
the O

you O

in O

and O
that O
pure O

is O
better O

I’m O
going O
to O
answer O
your O

with O
a O
slightly O
less O

[SEP]
The O

Here's O

not. O
The O

[SEP]
🤦🏼‍♂️ O
PSF O

they're O

I'd O

[SEP]
I'm O
perfectly O

Give O

mid O

for O
100$ O

Then O
i O
have O

Lol O
yes O

I’m O

Probably O
not O

also O

I O
don't O

If O

who O

[SEP]
It's O
this O
elitist O

my O

people O
off O

I’ve O
already O
stated O
I O
respect O
your O

you O

also O
just O
respect O
that O

fine O
before O
it O
was O

we O
didn’t O

smoking O

I O
see O
the O

that’s O

This O
whole O

started O
with O
you O
saying O
"Chad" O
could O
get O
better O

then O
any O
legal O
option. O
All's O
I'm O
saying O
is O
if O
their O
weed O
is O
good, O
clean O
and O
they're O
not O
fucking O
criminals, O
they'd O
go O
legit. O

If O
they O
can't, O
that O
sucks, O

I'm O

the O

I O
wouldn't O
trust O
Chad O

over O
any O
decent, O
reputable O
LP's. O
1000% O
[SEP]
Not O
any O
legal O
option. O
But O
any O
affordable O
Oz O
option O
yea. O
I’ll O
still O
buy O
some O
cheap O
legal O
ounces O
just O
for O
convenience O
and O
consistency. O
It O
is O
nice O
to O
just O
go O
to O
the O
store O
and O
know O
exactly O
what O
I’m O
getting. O
But O
I O
do O
feel O
the O
legal O
market O
is O
just O
sort O
of O
weak O
in O
the O
budget O
oz O
sector. O
And O
did O
you O
smoke O
weed O
pre-legalization? O
Every O
experienced O
grower O
was O
a O
“fuckin O
criminal” O
at O
some O
point O
haha. O
There O
is O
good O
clean O
weed O
out O
there. O
[SEP]
You’re O
putting O
“decent, O

Shows O
how O
little O
you O
know… O
Bought O
their O
stuff O
3 O
times O
and O
was O
moldy O
twice, O
it O
was O
comparable O
to O
a O
$10 O
oz O
I O
bought O
in O
Mexico O
[SEP]
Yes, O
I O
smoked O
for O
many O
years O
before O

I O
also O
had O
a O

I O
was O

once O

I O
was O
able O
to O
learn O
more. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Every O
black O

was O
a O

I O

what O

All O
I’m O
really O

I’d O

to O
see O
some O

that O
the O

will O
continue O

happens. O

When O
I’ve O

2/3 O
times O
from O
one O
company, O
and O
not O
once O
in O
hundreds O

“Chad O

I’ve O

I O
have O

I O
definitely O
have O

in O
the O
Australian O
job O
market O
you're O
not O
really O
going O
to O
be O
competing O
against O
Ivy O
League O
graduates O
often O
because O
the O
ivy O
league O
doesn't O
exist O
here. O
I O
think O
in O
general O
we O
care O
a O
lot O
less O
about O
University O
rankings. O
I'm O
not O
saying O
it O
doesn't O
matter O
at O
all, O
just O
that O
it O
doesn't O
matter O
that O
much. O
I O
think O
in O
general O
both O
in O
and O
out O
of O
Australia, O
people O
are O
more O
interested O
in O
the O
work O
you've O
done. O
If O
you O
have O
good O
work O
and O
good O
publications O
nobody O
will O
carr O
about O
your O
institution, O
and O
after O
your O
first O
job O
they'll O
care O
even O
less. O
Also O
Swinburne O
isn't O
bad. O
And O
Melbourne O
is O
a O
great O
city. O
And O
those O
funded O
positions O
are O
competitive O
so O
it's O
an O
achievement O
in O
and O
of O
itself O
to O
get O
that. O
If O
you O
like O
the O
course, O
the O
professor, O
and O
the O
city, O
I O
really O
really O
wouldn't O
stress O
about O
the O
prestige. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
the O
common O
advice O
is O
usually O
worry O
more O
about O
the O
advisor O
than O
the O
school. O
That O
being O
said, O
I O
know O
PhDs O
from O
the O
ivy's O
and O
from O
regular O
schools O
and O
it's O
clear O
that O
the O
ivy's O
get O
preference O
for O
all O
sorts O
of O
funding O
after O
their O
graduation, O
as O
you O
would O
expect. O

[SEP]
My B-Wife_GF

retiring I-Wife_GF
in B-Time
5 I-Time
months I-Time
and O
we O
are O
buying O

the O

a O

from O

stating O

with O
her O
name O
on O
a O

letter O
head. O
Has O
anyone O
gone O
through O
this? O
Also, O
any O
advice O
on O
how O
to O
get O
the O
letter O
we O
have O
been O
calling O
the O
VA O
but O
no O
one O
is O
picking O
up. O
[SEP]
Get O
a O
different O
bank O
if O
they O
don't O
understand O
where O
military O
retirement O
pay O
comes O
from. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Further, O
DFAS O
doesn't O
even O
know O
what O
her O
retired O
pay O
will O
be O
yet O
because O
those O
calculations O
are O
done O
after O
separation. O
you O
can O
kind O
of O
do O
the O
math O
yourself O
and O
ballpark O
it O
based O
off O
her O
draft O
DD-214 O
but O
you O
won't O
the O
final O
answer O
until O
she O
either O
gets O
her O
first O
ERAS O
or O
the O
payment O
hits O
the O
bank. O
That O
is O
the O
ay O
it O
worked O
when O
I O
retired. O
I O
want O
to O
say O
DFAS O
has O
up O
to O
60 O
days O
to O
start O
paying O
you. O
The O
final O
month's O
AD O
pay O
is O
held O
pending O
the O
final O
audit O
from O
DFAS, O
mine O
was O
released O
45 O
days O
after O
my O
retirement O
date. O
In O
my O
case O
I O
got O
my O
retirement O
check O
the O
following O
month O
but O
I O
know O
guys O
who O
did O
not. O
[SEP]
Might O
be O
some O
confusion O
on O
this. O
I O
believe O
the O
letter O
they O
are O
asking O
for O
is O
to O
see O
if O
you O
need O
to O
pay O
the O
funding O
fee O
or O
not. O
My O
bank O
didn't O
ask O
for O
this O
when O
I O
was O
retiring, O
with O
a O
pending O
disability O
claim, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
funding O
fee. O
A O
VSO O
might O
be O
able O
to O
help O
get O
this O
letter. O
It O
should O
only O
state O
that O
you O
have O
a O
pending O
claim, O
and O
are O
expected O
to O
get O
10% O
or O
more. O
This O
only O
applies O
if O
you O
are O
closing O
after O
your O
date O
of O
separation, O
not O
if O
you O
are O
closing O
while O
on O
active O
duty, O
because O
your O
date O
of O
disability O
will O
be O
after O
your O
separation O
date. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
they O
are O
asking O
for O
this O
to O
get O
a O
loan O
approval O
they O
are O
wrong, O
this O
is O
only O
used O
for O
closing O
costs(funding O
fee). O
[SEP]
VA O
pays O
for O
disabilities, O
not O
retirement. O
[SEP]
Even O
if O
you O
get O
someone O
to O
answer O
whatever O
phone O
number O
you O
are O
calling, O
VA O
can’t O
give O
you O
a O
letter O
like O
that. O
VA O
is O
not O
part O
of O
the O
military O
so O
won’t O
give O
her O
that O
information. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Get O
a O
different O
bank O
that O
actually O
knows O
what O
they O
are O
doing. O
[SEP]
The O
bank O
wouldn't O
use O
my O
future O
(retiring O
in O
1 O
month) O
retirement O
pay O
as O
it O
had O
not O
happened O
yet. O
We O
had O
to O
find O
another O
way. O
Total O
shit O
[SEP]
Why O
does O
the O
bank O
need O
to O
know O
she O
is O
retiring? O
Not O
what O
you O
asked O
but O
have O
you O
considered O
calling O
a O
mortgage O
broker O
(one O
who O
works O
with O
many O
banks) O
for O
a O
better O
rate/deal? O
[SEP]
The O
bank O
wants O
proof O
of O
income. O
Pretty O
common O
issue O
with O
military O
retiring. O
[SEP]
Yeah O
I O
can O
understand O
that O
but O
what O
if O
the O
member O
is O
not O
gonna O
retire? O
Like O
say O
they O
got O
19 O
years O
and O
they O
wanna O
stay O
until O
26-30 O
years. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Not O
to O
mention O
its O
not O
a O
secret O
how O
military O
retirement O
is O
calculated. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
guess O
I'm O
not O
surprised, O
banks O
have O
definitely O
learned O
from O
the O
housing O
crisis O
15 O
years O
ago. O
[SEP]
If O
they O
aren’t O
going O
to O
retire, O
the O
LES O
would O
reflect O
a O
future O
date. O
[SEP]
Not O
true, O
prior O

if O

can O
lead O

If O

keep O

keto, O
then O
by O
all O

go O

High O
insulin O
during O
a O
lifetime O
is O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
causes O
of O
insulin O
resistance. O
Continuing O
to O
shoot O
insulin O
makes O
type O
2 O
a O
progressive O
disease. O
Using O
an O
insulin O
pusher O
(a O
drug O
that O
makes O
the O
pancreas O
produce O
more O
insulin) O
does O
the O
same O
thing. O
Just O
stop O
eating O
carbohydrates O
and O
watch O
your O
BG O
fall. O
I O
can O
say O
this O
from O
experience. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
20 O
years O
ago O
and O
took O
the O
advice O
of O
physicians O
with O
whom O
I O
worked. O
They O
all O
told O
be O
the O
same O
thing, O
"Stop O
eating O
carbohydrates. O
But, O
I O
am O
not O
your O
physician O
and O
did O
not O
tell O
you O
this". O
20 O
years O
later O
I O
am O
still O
on O
an O
extremely O
low O
carb O
diet. O
I O
eat O
about O
20 O
grams O
per O
day. O
I O
started O
this O
diet O
journey O
by O
stopping O
all O
carbohydrates. O
I O
went O
through O
withdrawal O
for O
3 O
days. O
It O
felt O
awful. O
After O
3 O
days O
it O
was O
like O
a O
miracle. O
I O
felt O
better O
than O
I O
had O
in O
so O
many O
years. O
It O
was O
like O
I O
had O
20 O
years O
taken O
off O
my O
age. O
I O
felt O
so O
good O
that O
it O
was O
a O
long O
time O
before O
I O
would O
even O
eat O
anything O
green. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Metformin O

I O
prefer O
the O
ER O
version. O
It O
is O
cheap O
and O
has O
proven O
itself O
over O
the O
decades. O
Metformin O
does O
not O
allow O
you O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
eat O
carby O
stuff O
that O
is O
bad O
for O
you. O
It O
just O
helps O
perhaps O
with O
most O
people O
by O
knocking O
off O
10 O
points O
from O
your O
BG O
meter. O
[SEP]

Use O
your O
meter O
often! O
believe O
your O
meter. O
If O
you O
want O
to O
know O
how O
a O
food O
affects O
your O
BG, O
you O
need O
to O
eat O
a O
portion O
that O
you O
would O
normally O
eat O
and O
then O
measure O
every O
15 O
minutes O
for O
2 O

3 O
hours. O
You O
need O
to O
detect O
the O
spike. O
Spikes O
count. O
Any O
reading O
over O
140 O
begins O
irreversible O
cellular O
damage. O
Taking O
your O
BG O
2 O

3 O

New O

Question O
[SEP]
I O
am O
fairly O
new O
to O
spark O
and O
have O
a O
question O
for O
those O
who O
have O
been O
doing O
this O
for O
a O
while... O
Orders O
with O
multiple O
deliveries, O
what O
is O
your O
process? O
I B-Possession
drive I-Possession
a I-Possession
Toyota I-Possession
Prius. I-Possession
I O
recently O
had O
two O
orders O
and O
the O
loader O
asked O
which O
order O
I O
wanted O
in O
my O
trunk, O
one O
was O
a O
small O
order O
the O
other O
a O
medium. O
When O
I O
told O
him O
both, O
he O
questioned O
me O
as O
to O
how O
I O
would O
know O
which O
was O
for O
each O
order. O
Told O
him O
the O
smaller O
order O
was O
to O
go O
in O
my O
vmcatering O
bag O
and O
the O
bigger O
one O
out O
if O
the O
bag. O
(I O
was O
planning O
on O
packing O
the O
other O
order O
in O
bigger O
bags O
to O
make O
delivery O
easier, O
just O
wasn't O
trying O
to O
hold O
up O
the O
loader). O
But, O
it O
got O
me O
thinking O
if O
I O
was O
to O
take O
one O
of O
the O
orders O
that O
have O
9-12 O
deliveries, O
even O
though O
most O
were O
one O
or O
two O
items, O
the O
sticker O
would O
be O
on O
that O
single O
bag, O
but O
there O
were O
some O
that O
obviously O
would O
be O
multiple O
bags. O
I O
feel O
slowing O
the O
loader O
down O
while O
I O
pack O
in O
seperate O
"delivery" O
bags O
is O
not O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do... O
Do O
you O
all O
use O
those O
multiple O
compartment O
trunk O
dividers? O
Any O
help O
would O
be O
greatly O
appreciated. O

Very O

one O
in O

If O
they O

and O
other O
general O
merchandise O
are O
usually O
in O
bags O
with O
one O
sticker O
per O

going O
with O
you. O
It's O
much O
easier O
to O
keep O
them O
separated O
(one O
in O
the O
truck O
and O
one O
inside O
the O
car) O
just O
to O
be O
on O

The O
9-12 O
orders O
are O
not O
grocery O

Its O

thats O
packed O
like O

packages. O
Curbside O
grocery O
picks O
are O
always O
only O
1 O

2 O
customers. O
Thats O
why O
when O
loading O
grocery O
pickuups, O
the O
bigger O
on O
goes O
in O
the O

smaller O
one O
in O

I O
put O
all O

I O
can O

I O

put O

one O

Try O

I O
drive O
a O

too, O
and O
always O
have O
my O

down O

I O
always O
put O
the O
smaller O

into O
large O

the O
bigger O
order O
into O
ikea O
bags. O
None O
of O
the O

have O
had O
an O
issue O
with O
this, O
so O
far. O
I O
can O
see O
they O
mark O
one O
order O
for O
the O
trunk O
and O
one O
for O
back O
seat O
on O
there O
end O
even O
though O
I O
don’t O
technically O

[SEP]
For O
the O
dotcom O

if O
I O
have O
more O
than O
six O

eight O
orders O
I O
actually O
alphabetize O
them O
in O
my O
trunk/cargo O
area O
after O
the O

has O
finished. O
Makes O
it O
super O
easy O
to O
grab O
the O
one O
I O
want O
and O
if O
somebody O
has O
multiple O

they O
will O
be O
together O

I O
won't O
have O

hunt O
for O
them. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
crap O
in O
your O
backseat, O
you O
need O
to O
take O
it O
out O
when O
you're O
sparking. O
The O
loaders O
have O
good O
reason O
to O
not O
want O
to O
put O
other O
people's O
groceries O
in O
with O
your O
stuff, O
because O
of O
hygiene O
concerns O
and O
also O
because O
they O
don't O
want O
it O
getting O
lost O
in O
the O
shuffle. O
All O
my O
personal O
stuff O
goes O
in O
the O
front O
passenger O
seat. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you. O
My O
back O
seat O
I O
had O
a O
carseat O
and O
all O
my O
"delivery"/reusable O
grocery O
bags O
that O
I O
normally O
keep O
in O
my O
trunk O
but O
wanted O
out O
of O
the O
way O
for O
the O
orders. O
I O
did O
that O
because O
I O
had O
read O
on O
another O
post O
how O
a O
loader O
complained O
about O
stuff O
being O
the O
a O
drivers O
trunk, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
like O
a O
crate O
of O
necessities O
in O
a O
car- O
jumper O
cables, O
etc. O
So O
because O
of O
that, O
I O
didn't O
think O
putting O
an O
order O
in O
the O
back O
seat O
would O
be O
"approved" O
with O
my O
personal O
items O
there. O
But O
I O
appreciate O
your O
info, O
thank O
you. O
It O
helps. O
[SEP]
Ok, O
That O
makes O
sense, O
I O
have O
seen O
some O
white O
with O
yellow O
packaging O
that O
resembled O
the O
Amazon O
gray O
plastic O
bags. O
I O
am O
assuming O
that O
is O
what O
you O
mean O
as O
packed O
like O
Amazon. O
Then O
each O
on O
of O
those O
packages O
has O
its O
own O
sticker O
even O
if O
you O
have O
multiple O
ones O
going O
to O
the O
same O
address? O
This O
makes O
more O
sense O
in O
my O
head O
now. O
I O
had O
been O
scared O
of O
accepting O
any O
and O
worrying O
how O
it O
would O
fit O
in O
the O
car, O
had O
one O
that O
looked O
like O
the O
description O
was O
a O
32" O

well. O

all O
the O
time. O
[SEP]
I O
JUST O
started O
this O
job O
at O
a O
daycare. O
I'm B-Occupation
a I-Occupation
floater/assistant I-Occupation
I've O
been O
working O
with O
the O
babies O
and O
it O
seems O
that O
this O
is O
the O
season O
for O
everyone O
to O
be O
sick. O
The O
problem O
is, O
I'm O
also O
getting O
sick. O
Ive O
only O
been O
there O
for O
three O
weeks O
and O
each O
week O
I've O
actually O
caught O
what O
the O
babies O
had. O
First O
two O
weeks O
I O
had O
a O
fever O
for O
a O
few O
days O
and O
now O
I've O
caught O
the O
stomach O
bug. O
I O
havent O
stopped O
throwing O
up O
for O
two O
days O
and O
could O
barely O
see O
straight. O
I've O
finally O
caught O
my O
breath O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
it O
has O
me O
thinking O
a O
lot. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Is O
this O
job O
even O
worth O
it? O
I O
love O
the O
babies O
dearly O
already O
and O
my O
coworkers O
think O
I'm O
a O
great O
team O
player. O
I O
just O
can't O
believe O
I've O
been O
this O
sick O
already O
and O
I O
feel O
so O
freaking O
guilty O
not O
being O
there. O
They're O
understanding O
but O
how O
understanding O
are O
they O
going O
to O
be? O
I O
just O
want O
some O
second O
opinions. O
Is O
it O
worth O
waiting O
for O
my O
immune O
system O
to O
toughen O
up? O
I'm O
thinking O
I O
should O
just O
quit O
at O
this O
point, O
I O
can't O
keep O
getting O
sick O
and O
I O
can't O
keep O
calling O
out O
and O
leaving O
people O
hanging. O
[SEP]
So, O
I O
think O
it's O
a O
misconception/myth O
that O
your O
"immune O
system O
gets O
stronger" O
the O
more O
you O
work O
with O
children. O
While O
it's O
true O
that O
your O
body O
will O
develop O
antibodies O
whenever O
it's O
exposed O
to O
a O
virus O
(like O
the O
cold O
or O
flu), O
there O
are O
hundreds O
upon O
hundreds O
of O
viruses O
that O
effect O
humans, O
that O
the O
likelihood O
of O
becoming O
immune O
to O
all O
of O
them O
is O
low. O
And O
everyone's O
immune O
response O
is O
going O
to O
be O
different O
-- O
if O
you're O
immune O
compromised, O
being O
exposed O
to O
more O
viruses O
can O
actually O
be O
harmful. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
To O
answer O
your O
question O
-- O
I O
don't O
know. O
But O
from O
my O
experience, O
you O
don't O
stop O
getting O
sick. O
Some O
viruses O
may O
be O
less O
intense O
than O
others, O
but O
after O
13+ O
years, O
I'm O
still O
getting O
sick. O
The O
only O
thing O
that O
has O
prevented O
illness O
is O
wearing O
a O
mask O
for O
me. O
So O
after O
4 O
different O
bouts O
of O
illness O
this O
school O
year, O
I've O
put O

How's O
the O
culture O
around O
masking O
where O
you O
work? O
I've O
gone O
back O
to O
wearing O
them O
after O
getting O
really O
sick O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
a O
couple O
years. O
I'll O
probably O
wear O
it O
for O
cold O
and O
flu O
season O
then O
drop O
them O
again O
when O
things O
get O
better. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
also O
found O
the O
younger O
the O
kids O
I O
work O
with O
the O
more O
often O
I O
get O
sick. O
Babies O
are O
literally O
on O
you O
all O
the O
time, O
not O
to O
mention O
having O
to O
wipe O
their O
noses O
all O
day. O
I O
stopped O
getting O
as O
sick O
when O
I O
started O
working O
with O
an O
older O
age O
group O
so O
maybe O
keep O
that O
in O
mind O
for O
down O
the O
road? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
do O
feel O
you O
though, O
I O
got O
pneumonia O
TWICE O
the O
first O
year O
I B-Occupation
worked I-Occupation
in I-Occupation
ECE. I-Occupation
It O
does O

never O

on O

[SEP]
Do O
you O
wear O
a O
mask O
at O
work? O
I O
also O
work O
with O
infants O
and O
wearing O
a O
mask O
has O
I O
think O
prevented O
me O
from O
getting O
sick O
so O
far. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
haven’t O
worked O
without O
one; O
so O
not O
sure O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
I O
didn’t, O
I O
assume O
I’d O
be O
getting O
sick. O
[SEP]
I O
literally O
came O
back O
to O
this O
sub O
just O
to O
see O
if O
anyone O
else O
was O
struggling O
with O
this. O
I O
am O
sick O
again O
for O
the O
fifth O
or O
sixth O
time O
within O
the O
span O
of O
like O
two O
months O
and O
it’s O
EXHAUSTING. O
The O
fact O
that O
if O
you O
were O
to O
take O
time O
off O
every O
time O
you O
got O
sick, O
you’d O
barely O
be O
there, O
makes O
it O
some O
much O
more O
frustrating. O
It’s O
like O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
until O
you’re O
actually O
incapable O
of O
functioning O
to O
take O
a O
single O
day O
off. O
I O
adore O
the O
kids O
i O
work O
with O
too O
so O
I O
don’t O
think O
I O
could O
bring O
myself O
to O
leave, O
but O
every O
time O
I O
feel O
that O
sore O
throat O
coming O
on, O
I O
definitely O
rethink O
it O
for O
a O
minute. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day, O
we’ve O
all O
got O
to O
take O
care O
of O
our O
health. O
A O
coworker O
of O
mine O
left O
suddenly O
without O
giving O
notice O
because O
she O
kept O
getting O
sick O
too. O
It O
just O
depends O
on O
how O
you O
feel O
and O
if O
you O
and O
your O
health O
can O
handle O
it O
all. O

We O
constantly O
were O
on O

hung O
out O
near O

every O
day O
and O
NEVER O
had O

[SEP]
In O
october O
2021 O
Rachel O
met O
her O
boyfriend O
i O
will O
be O
calling O
Kyle O
(m17). B-Age_Gender
Kyle O
never O
liked O
me O
very O
much O
but O
we O
still O
managed O
to O
be O
civil O
and O
would O
speak O
on O
nights O
out. O
In O
november O
2021 O
Rachel O
sent O
a O
picture O
to O
Kyle O
of O
me O
slapping O
her O
ass. O
I O
would O
like O
to O
preference O
this O
by O
saying O
i B-Sexual_Orientation
am I-Sexual_Orientation
gay I-Sexual_Orientation
and O
she O
told O
me O
to O
do O
it O
as O
it O
would O
be O
funny. O
After O
this O
we O
got O
dressed O
and O
went O
to O
a O
party O
not O
checking O
our O
phones. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
we O
both O
checked O
our O
phones O
to O
see O
Kyle O
had O
text O
both O
of O
us O
giving O
out O
and O
being O
quite O
agressive, O
Rachel O
crying O
and O
me, O
being O
drunk, O
sent O
him O
a O
voice O
message O
explaining O
i O
don’t O
understand O
why O
he O
is O
so O
angry O
at O
us O
seeing O
as O
i’m B-Sexual_Orientation
gay I-Sexual_Orientation

have O
been O

Rachel O
for O
4 O

always O
done O
stupid O
stuff O
like O
this O
and O
have O
never O
had O
any O
relationship O
(even O
before O
coming O
out). O
Kyle O
finally O
calmed O
down O
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
and O
it O
was O
all O
ok O
again. O
[SEP]
This O
past O
March O
me, O
Kyle O
and O
Rachel O
went O
to O
a O
bar O
with O
a O
few O
of O
our O
friends O
for O
drinks. O
The O
night O
went O
well O
and O
no O
drama O
happened O
the O
whole O
night. O
As O
i O
was O
leaving O
i O
hugged O
Rachel O
goodbye O
and O
left O
with O
Kyle O
and O
a O
few O
of O
our O
mutual O
friends O
to O
go O
home. O
Kyle O
never O
said O
anything O
to O
me O
and O
it O
all O
seemed O
ok. O
the O
next O
morning O
i O
woke O
up O
to O
being O
given O
out O
to O
by O
both O
Kyle O
And O
Rachel O
for O
trying O
to O
get O
in O
between O
them. O
i O
obviously O
confused O
said O
i O
didn’t O
no O
what O
they O
ment O
yet O
they O
both O
blocked O
me O
and O
he O
was O
threatening O
to O
beat O
me O
up O
[SEP]
me O
and O
Rachel O
stopped O
talking O
for O
a O
few O
months O
and O
i O
was O
devestated O
because O
i O
lost O
my O
best O
friend. O
[SEP]
2 O
months O
ago O
Kyle O
and O
Rachel O
broke O
up. O
She O
rang O
me O
crying O
over O
it O
and O
i O
cheered O
her O
up. O
Later O
that O
day O
while O
hanging O
out O
with O
friends O
i O
saw O
that O
Rachel O
had O
added O
me O
on O
snapchat O
and O
we O
started O
talking O
as O
we O
used O
to. O
[SEP]
4 O
days O
later O
Rachel O
and O
Kyle O
got O
back O
together O
but O
Rachel O
promised O
she O
would O
tell O
Kyle O
to O
be O
nice O
to O
me O
and O
we O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
friends. O
[SEP]
last O
week O
i O
saw O
that O
Rachel O
had O
blocked O
me O
on O
snapchat O
for O
no O
apparent O
reason. O
i O
confronted O
her O
about O
it O
and O
she O
said O
her O
phone O
must O
have O
glitched. O
she O
added O
me O
back O
but O
about O
2 O
hours O
later O
she O
had O
blocked O
me O
again. O
The O
next O
day O
at O
school O
i O
asked O
her O
again O
if O
it O
was O
Kyles O
fault O
i O
was O
blocked O
again O
and O
she O
immediately O
got O
defensive, O
she O
said O
the O
reason O
she O
blocked O
me O
is O
because O
i O
was O
annoying O
and O
a O
bitch. O
this O
set O
me O
off O
and O
i O
blew O
up O
at O
her O
for O
still O
[SEP]
being O
with O
Kyle O
and O
being O
to O
pussy O
to O
stand O
up O
for O
herself. O
i O
told O
everyone O
about O
how O
toxic O
she O
had O
been O
and O
then O
leaked O
all O
our O
chats O
of O
her O
being O
rude O
and O
a O
video O
of O
her O
and O
Kyle O
making O
out. O
Everyone O
laughed O
about O
it O
and O
everyone O
is O
saying O
i’m O
in O
the O
right O
except O
my O
group, O
they O
are O
saying O
i’m O
being O
an O
assshole O
and O
have O
been O
standoffish O
with O
me O
since. O
[SEP]
so O
AITA O
[SEP]
putting O
people's O
private O
messages O
out O
whew O
is O
never O
good, O
and O
the O
video O
of O
them.kisaing O
is O
just O
weird O
to O

it O
sounds O
like O
she's O
got O
herself O
an O
abusive, O

her O
an O

don't O

I O

what O

you O
weigh O
293 O

get O
down O

my O

needing O
to O
stop O
for O
breath. O
I O
guess O
the O
goal O
weight O
is O
just O
more O
of O
a O
concrete O
victory O
to O
strive O
for, O
but O
all O
the O
other O
little O
things O
are O
going O
to O
mean O
far O
more O
to O
me O
as O
they O
happen. O
[SEP]
I O
never O
had O
a O
goal O
weight O
either O
and O
really O
believe O
that O
is O
the O
healthier O
approach. O
I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
I O
want O
to O
do O
to O
enjoy O
the O
full O
capabilities O
of O
my O
body O
that O
only O
weightloss O
will O
provide, O
but O
saying O
I O
want O
to O
weigh O
120 O
and O
be O
a O
size O
4 O
is O
not O
an O
approach O
that O
I O
am O
willing O
to O
take. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
you O
should O
have O
a O
preliminary O
goal O
(like O
losing O
70% O
of O
excess O
weight) O
but O
I O
don’t O
think O
anyone O
can O
have O
a O
final O
goal O
because O
most O
of O
us O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
it O
would O
be O
because O
we’ve O
been O
so O
far O
away O
for O
most O
or O
all O
of O
our O
adult O
lives. O
My O
preliminary O
goal O
is O
to O
lose O
the O
excess O
then O
I’ll O
reassess. O
I O
want O
to O
get O
to O
a O
lifestyle O
that O
has O
balance O
and O
isn’t O
all O
or O
nothing. O
[SEP]
I O
hope O
it's O
normal O
because O
I O
don't O
either O
lol. O
[SEP]
I B-Appearance
was I-Appearance
200 I-Appearance
lbs I-Appearance
at B-Age
10 I-Age
years I-Age
old, I-Age
so O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
adult O
me O
is O
supposed O
to O
weigh O
or O
what O
is O
realistic. O
[SEP]
I O
agree O
with O
everyone O
else, O
I O
think O
it's O
more O
about O
having O
a O
healthy O
goal. O
[SEP]
I O
loved O
going O
based O
on O
NSV O
as O
opposed O
to O
an O
overall O
end O
goal. O
I O
also O
don’t O
have O
a O
number O
and O
my O
surgeon O
didn’t O
either. O
He O
cares O
about O
my O
overall O
health. O
I O
am O
almost O
2 O
years O
post O
op O
and O
at O
my O
18 O
month O
Check O
up O
he O
said O
to O
match O
the O
BMI O
range O
I’d O
have O
to O
lose O
20 O
more O
pounds O
but O
he O
doesn’t O
care O
about O
that. O
He O
is O
so O
happy O
with O
my O
progress O
and O
now O
wants O
me O
focusing O
on O
building O
muscle O
for O
better O
overall O
health. O
So O
I O
have O
no O
actual O
stated O
goal O
weight O
from O
my O
surgeon O
and O
I O
have O
never O
really O
cared O
about O
one. O
I B-Appearance
started I-Appearance
this I-Appearance
journey I-Appearance
at I-Appearance
314+ I-Appearance
pounds I-Appearance
and I-Appearance
am I-Appearance
hovering I-Appearance
around I-Appearance
175 I-Appearance
right I-Appearance
now I-Appearance
so O
I’m O
just O
pleased O
overall! O
I O
love O
not O
having O
a O
goal O
weight. O
[SEP]
My O
surgeon O
asked O
me O
what O
my O
goal O
weight O
was, O
on O
my O
1 O
year O
anniversary. O
I O
straight O
up O
told O
him O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
be O
defined O
by O
a O
number. O
I O
can O
walk O
without O
a O
cane, O
do O
stuff O
without O
being O
out O
of O
breath. O
That O
is O
my O
goal. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Plus O
I O
really O
hate O
buying O
clothes O
lol. O
[SEP]
Eh O
I O
don’t O
have O
a O
hard O
number. O
I O
had O
a O
loose O
one O
where O
I O
hit O
milestones O
with O
each O
birth/pregnancy O
of O
my O
kids. O
So O
far O
I’m O
down O
to O
birth O
of O
2nd O
kid. O
Still O
need O
to O
work O
down O
to O
1st O
kid. O
If O
I O
get O
that O
far O
maybe O
weight O
at O
enlistment? O
[SEP]
The O
only O
numerical O
goal O
I O
have O
is O
to O
get O
into O
the O
100's O
again, O
but O
I O
don't O
have O
a O
goal O
weight. O
I O
think O
wanting O
to O
be O
and O
live O
healthy, O
and O
feel O
better, O
is O
a O
good O
enough O
goal. O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
have O
a O
weight O
goal. O
A O
few O
years O
ago O
I O
managed O
to O
lose O
50 O
lbs. O
Played O
the O
best O
golf O
of O
my O
life O
that O
summer, O
then O
gained O
it O
back. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
walk O
18 O
with O
my O
son O
with O
no O
foot, O
knee O
or O
back O
pain O
and O
maybe O
even O
be O
able O
to O
beat O
him O
on O
occasion. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
you O
have O
a O
very O
healthy O
perspective. O
[SEP]
My O
consultant O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
had O
any O
more O
questions O
and O
then O
said O
oh O
you O
should O
loose O
about O
85kg, O
most O
people O
ask O
that O
question, O
I O
didn't O
know O
hiw O
much O
that O
was O
( O
from O
UK O
and O
use O
stones O
and O
lbs) O
but O
smiled O
and O
said O
great O
[SEP]
I O
never O
wrote O
down O
or O
spoke O
a O
goal O
weight O
because O
I O
mentally O
did O
not O
want O
to O
put O
pressure O
on O
myself O
or O
end O
up O
feeling O
failure O
if O
I O
did O
not O
get O
there. O
I O
know O
there O
is O
a O
weight O
above O
an O
ideal O
weight O
that O
I O
would O
be O
comfortable O
and O
healthier O
at. O
Would O
I O
like O
to O
get O
to O
my O
ideal O
weight O
sure O
but O
I O
focused O
more O
on O
following O
a O
healthier O
eating O
and O
lifestyle O
and O
let O
the O
results O
be O
what O
they O
are. O
I O
had O
also O
read O
that O
on O
average O
people O
lose O
a O
percentage O
of O
their O
“excess” O
weight. O
Something O
like O
75 O
percent. O
But O
anyway O
the O
inverse O
of O
that O
is O
that O
people O
still O
keep O
a O
percentage O
of O
their O
excess O
weight O
so O
I O
didn’t O
want O
to O
create O
an O
unrealistic O
scenario O
that O
would O
trigger O
me O
to O
feel O
as O
though O
I O
failed O
[SEP]
Also O
don't O
have O
one O
but O
a O
ton O
of O
different O
goals. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
have O
an O
end O
goal… O
I O
have O
“little” O
goals O
along O
the O
way… O
I’m O
down O
160 O
lbs O
and O
about O
10 O
lbs O
away O
from O
actually O
being O
what O
my O
driver’s O
license O
says O
I O
weight… O
that O
was O
a O
goal O
for O
me. O
I O
also O
want O
to O
weigh O
less O
than O
my O
husband O
(about O
50 O
lbs O
away O
right O
now). O
But O
my O
next O
dr O
visit O
I O
plan O
on O
asking O
what O
a O
realistic O
goal O
weight O
for O
me O
will O
be O
because O
I O
know O
I’m O
gonna O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
excess O
skin O
weight. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
have O
a O
goal O
weight. O
My O
goals O
are O
to O
bring O
my O
blood O
sugar O
levels O
down, O
I’m O
a O
type O
2 O
diabetic, O
and O
just O
overall O
have O
a O
more O
healthy O
body. O
[SEP]
My O
take O
on O
that O
question O
(goal O
weight) O
is O
that O
they O
want O
to O
be O
sure O
your O
aim O
isn’t O
unreasonable. O
Imagine O
putting O
down O
a O
number O
so O
low O
that, O
for O
an O
person O
who’s O
never O
dealt O
with O
weight O
issues, O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
achieve. O
I O
think O
it’s O
fair O
to O
say O
“I’d O
expect O
to O
feel O
comfortable O
in O
my O
body O
at O
X O
weight, O
but O
what O
my O
real O
goal O
is O
to O
ride O
a O
bike O
without O
my O
joints O
hurting, O
be O
able O
to O
play O
with O
my O
kids O
without O
being O
too O
out O
of O
breadth, O
etc.” O
As O
everyone O
alludes O
to O
- O
it’s O
a O
major O
mental O
challenge, O
so O
you’re O
head O
has O
to O
be O
in O
a O
reasonable O
space. O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
have O
a O
goal O
weight O
and O
never O
have. O
Told O
my O
surgeon, O
my O
nutritionist, O
my O
psychologist, O
everyone, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
fine O
with O
it. O
[SEP]
It's O
pretty O
simple, O
find O
the O
weight O
that O
puts O
you O
in O
the O
healthy O
BMI O
range O
..there's O
the O
goal. O
[SEP]
For O
sure O
normal! O
I O
didn’t O
have O
one O
at O
first O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
feel O
better O
and O
fit O
in O
clothes O
I O
liked. O
Then O
I O
got O
under O
200 O
and O
was O
like O
hey O
170 O
sounds O
like O
a O
good O
place O
cause O
it’s O
a O
“normal” O
BMI O
weight O
for O
my O
height. O
Now O
I’m O
under O
170 O
and O
I’m O
like O
hey O
150 O
would O
be O
cool! O
Who O
knows O
if O
I’ll O
have O
a O
new O
one O
at O
150 O
when O
I O
get O
there. O
Just O
going O
with O
the O
flow O
and O
what O
feels O
good O
for O
my O
body. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
it O
can O
also O
be O
discouraging O
in O
the O
beginning O
to O
have O
a O
“goal” O
cause O
it O
seems O
so O
far O
away, O
hundreds O
of O
pounds O
away O
and O
before O
surgery O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
like O
I’ll O
never O
get O
there O
so O
why O
even O
try. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
have O
a O
goal O
weight O
either, O
but O
if O
I O
can O
get O
down O
close O
to O
200lbs O
I’ll O
be O
happy. O
My O
“healthy” O
weight O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
134 O
and O
I O
don’t O
think O
that’s O
realistic O
for O
me, O
so O
my O
dad O
and O
I O
agree O
that O
we O
hope O
I O
can O
get O
down O
to O
200 O
at O
least. O
Doctor O
never O
mentioned O
a O
goal O
weight O
for O
me O
though O
[SEP]
I O
never O
really O
had O
a O
goal O
weight, O
but O
a O
goal O
range. O
I O
am O
now O
in O
that O
range O
and O
just O
work O
maintaining O
that O
3-5 O
pound O
range. O
[SEP]
So O
if O
they O
need O
a O
definitive O
answer O
look O
up O
the O
weight O
for O
the O
ideal O
bike O
u O
want O
to O
ride O
or O
the O
weight O
of O
a O
typical O
person O
who O
wears O
whatever O
size O
jeans O
u O
want O
to O
get O
into? O
[SEP]
Yeah O
the O
scale O
number O
is O
not O
everything. O
BMI O
is O
also O
not O
really O
a O
good O
indicator, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
also O
building O
muscle. O
I O
don’t O
have O
a O
weight O
goal, O
but O
more O
of O
a O
weight O
“range” O
because O
I O
know O
that O
I’m O
building O
muscle O
in O
the O
process O
and O
muscle O
weighs O
more O
than O
fat. O
Someone O
could O
look O
really O
fit O
and O
have O
muscle O
on O
them O
and O
the O
bmi O
calculator O
will O
tell O
them O
that O
they’re O
overweight O
lol. O
Body O
fat O
percentage O
is O
probably O
a O
better O
measure… O
[SEP]
My O
goal O
weight O
is O
to O
get O
down O
to O
wearing O
2XL O
shirts O
again, O
don't O
know O
what O
number O
that'll O
be O
for O
me. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
have O
a O
goal O
weight, O
either. O
I O
think O
I’ll O
know O
it O
when O
I O
get O
there O
n O
[SEP]
Echoing O
other O
responses. O
I O
just O
kind O
of O
guessed O
based O
on O
what O
I O
think O
I O
may O
have O
weighed O
at O
a O
reasonable O
place O
in O
history. O
I O
emphasized O
to O
my O
surgeon O
I O
was O
more O
interested O
in O
certain O
activities, O
not O
a O
weight. O
I O
care O
more O
about O
body O
composition O
than O
scale. O
Guess O
those O
were O
acceptable O
answers! O
Haha O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Good O
luck! O
:) O
[SEP]
Is O
it O
normal… O
absolutely. O
Everyone O
should O
have O
a O
goal O
but O
it’s O
not O
necessary. O
Your O
doctor/surgen/ O
primary O
provider O
can O
set O
one O
for O
you O
but O
it’s O
up O
to O
you O
to O
decide O
whether O
it O
works O
for O
you O
or O
you O
go O
beyond O
that. O
Either O
way, O
trust O
the O
process O
and O
you O
will O
be O
successful O
[SEP]
I O
just O
said O
154 O
because O
that’s O
the O
weight O
that O
put O
me O
at O
“normal” O
bmi. O
I O
just O
want O
to O
be O
healthy O
and O
able O
to O
do O

my O

50 O
pounds O
down O

My O
goal O
weight O
is O
seeing O
my O
collarbones O

i O

a O
goal. O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
program O
i O
was O
296. O
lb O
my O
heaviest O

i O
gained O
more O
weight O
after O
my O

but O
my O
pregnancy O
i O
didnt O
get O
the O
natural O
labor O
i O

i O

horrible. O
had O
to O
get O
epidural O
just O
to O
rest. O
(labor B-Other
took I-Other
2 I-Other
days) I-Other
and O
my O
daughter O
got O
stuck O
twice. O
pushing O
took O
3 O
hours O
but O
i O
got O
her O
out. O
either O
way O
i O
started O
having O
hypertension O
just O
at O
5 O
months O
of O
pregnancy O
and O
had O
alot O
of O
swelling(preclamcia O
runs O
in O
my O

my O
ashma O
got O
worse. O
back O
got O
worse O
and O
my O
knee O
injuries O
got O
worse. O
after O
having O
my O
daughter O
i B-Appearance
gained I-Appearance
more I-Appearance
weight I-Appearance
and I-Appearance
tipped I-Appearance
at I-Appearance
296. I-Appearance
it O
was O
a O
wake O
up O
call O
for O
me. O
when O
i O
saw O
the O
doctor O
i O
was O
286. O
goal O
weight O
for O
surgery O
was O
271. O
made O
it. O
had O
surgery O
oct. O
19 O
2022. O
now O
im O
232. O
what O
pushed O
me O
to O
have O
this O
surgery O
was O
that O
i O
wanted O
to O
be O
a O
better O
me, O
for O
myself, O
my O
husband, O
and O
my O
daughter. O
i O
want O
to O
be O
at O
a O
healthy O
bmi O
so O
i O
can O
live O
longer O
since O
i O
already O
have O
health O
issues, O
i O
also O
want O
to O
have O
a O
healthy O
pregnancy O
when O
it O
comes O
time O
for O
the O
2nd O
baby. O
:) O
i O
have O
multiple O
goals, O
first O
goal O
is O
to O
get O
under O
200lb. O
i O
would O
be O
thrilled. O
2nd O
goal O
is O
healthy O
bmi O
which O
is O
150-160lb. O
if O
you O
dont O
have O
a O
goal O
in O
mind O
thats O
fine, O
just O
strive O
to O
be O
a O
better O

healthier O
you O

[SEP]
I O
didn't O
have O
a O
goal O

[SEP]
Honestly, O
I O
thought O
this O
surgery O
would O
be O
just O
another O
thing O
that O
didn't O
work O
for O
me, O
so O
even O
if O
I O
put O
in O
the O
work O
(and O
I O
did O
do O
the O
work) O
- O
I O
just O
didn't O
want O
to O
be O
let O
down O
when O
the O
weight O
didn't O
drop O
like O
everything O
else O
I O
had O
tried. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I've O
been O
pleasantly O
surprise O
and O
have O
lost O
over O
100 O
lbs O
9 O
months O
out. O
[SEP]
I O
sure O
hope O
it’s O
normal O
because O
I O
definitely O
don’t O
have O
a O
number O
in O
mind. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
thought O
is O
that O
I’m O
going O
to O
do O
what O
I O
can O
to O
take O
care O
of O
myself O
as O
best O
I O
can. O
I’m O
going O
to O
lose O
weight O
in O
that O
process, O
but O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
much O
or O
when O
that O
weight O
will O
come O
off. O
In O
fact, O
it’s O
impossible O
for O
any O
of O
us O
to O
know. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
what O
they’re O
looking O
for O
on O
some O
form O
is O
that O
your O
number O
is O
realistic. O
Do O
you O
weigh O
293 O
pounds O
and O
want O
to O
get O
down O
to O
95? O
That’s O
probably O
not O
realistic O
or O
healthy. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
That O
definitely O
makes O
sense O
now! O
[SEP]
I O
love O
this! O
I O
haven't O
even O
thought O
about O
it, O
but O
riding O
a O
roller O
coaster O
again O
sounds O
like O
an O
amazing O
goal. O
I'm O
definitely O
adding O
that O
to O
my O
list O
now! O
I O
used O
to O
live O
going O
to O
amusement O
parks, O
but O
hell, O
being O
big O
and O
overweight O
walking O
in O
those O
parks O
is O
no O
joke! O
Ahhhh, O
I'm O
excited O
all O
over O
again O
to O
do O
this! O
Thank O
you! O
[SEP]
I've O
never O
been! O
I've O
been O
scuba O
diving, O
but O
never O
sky O
diving! O
I O
might O
have O
to O
look O
into O
this! O
[SEP]
I O
agree, O
the O
other O
little O
things O
I O
hope O
are O
going O
to O
be O
so O
much O
more O
worth O
it O
when O
I O
reach O
them! O
[SEP]
It O
helps O
knowing O
I'm O
not O
the O
only O
one! O
Thank O

I O

this O

Best O

[SEP]
That's O
my O
thoughts O
now! O
I O
am O
looking O
at O
a O
healthy O
weight O
based O
on O
my O
height, O
and O
I O
just O
can't O
imagine O
being O
that O
little! O
Hell, O
I O
don't O
think O
I've O
ever O
been O
that O
small. O
I'm O
pretty O
sure O
I O
just O
sailed O
right O
over O
that O
healthy O
range O
into O
being O
over. O
[SEP]
I'm O
in O
this O
boat. O
Overweight O
my O
entire O
life. O
No O
specific O
goal O
in O
my O
head. O
It O
just O
seems O
unrealistic O
[SEP]
Thank O
you. O
It's O
hard O
to O
imagine O
reaching O
other O
goals O
I've O
set O
for O
myself. O
[SEP]
I O
love O
this. O
Reading O
the O
goal O
weight O
for O
my O
height O
feels O
almost O
unreal! O
[SEP]
I O
know, O
I'm O
excited O
to O
for O
into O
jeans O
comfortably, O
but O
that O
definitely O
doesn't O
mean O
I'll O
enjoy O
going O
to O
buy O
them O
lol O
[SEP]
That's O
a O
great O
way O
to O
look O
at O
it. O
I'd O
love O
to O
be O
what O
I O
was O
before O
I O
had O
my O
son... O
you O
know, O
back O
when O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
sooo O
fat. O
🙄 O
[SEP]
I O
like O
how O
you O
said O
that, O
just O
a O
general O
goal O
number O
range. O
I O
think O
I O
might O
put O
something O
like O
that! O
I'm O
scouring O
over O
what O
is O
considered O
a O
healthy O
5 O
based O
on O
my O
height. O
Tbh, O
they O
so O
sound O
so O
little. O
I O
can't O
imagine O
ever O
being O
that O
tiny! O
[SEP]
My O
main O
diving O
force O
is O
to O
spend O
more O
quality O
active O
time O
with O
my O
son. O
I O
can't O
wait O
to O
feel O
good O
while O
doing O
activities O
with O
him, O
again. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
More O
often O
than O
not, O
I O
see O
number O
weight O
posts O
on O
here, O
and O
I'm O
truly O
excited O
for O
others, O
but O
when O
asked O
directly O
about O
mine... O
I O
panicked. O
[SEP]
Other O
than O
telling O
me O
I O
can't O
gain O
weight O
while O
in O
the O
program, O
numbers O
haven't O
really O
been O
discussed O
with O
my O
doctor. O
[SEP]
Wow. O
That's O
really O
deep, O
fam. O
Never O
would've O
thought O
as O
it O
being O
that O
way, O
either. O
I O
would O
definitely O
be O
in O
the O
group O
to O
label O
myself O
as O
a O
failure, O
if O
I O
didn't O
reach O
the O
goal. O
[SEP]
Have O
you O
had O
your O
surgery O
yet? O
[SEP]
Even O
while O
reading O
all O
these O
it O
never O
occurred O
to O
me O
to O
ask O
my O
doctor.. O
duh! O
[SEP]
That's O
it! O
I O
just O
want O
to O
be O
healthy. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
I O
know O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
mental O
undertaking O
that O
I'm O
sure O
I O
won't O
fully O
understand O
until O
I'm O
there O
and O
in O
the O
thick O
of O
it. O
[SEP]
This O
makes O
me O
feel O
so O
much O
better! O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
my O
healthy O
weight O
starts O
in O
the O
double O
digits O
for O
my O
height O
and O
ends O
around O
125... O
I O
can't O
imagine. O
[SEP]
How O
did O
you O
come O
up O
with O
your O
range? O
[SEP]
I O
just O
want O
to O
fit O
into O
jeans O
that O
are O
comfortable O
all O
over! O
[SEP]
This O
never O
crossed O
my O
mind O
when O
it O
should O
have, O
thank O
you O
for O
the O
tip! O
I O
definitely O
want O
to O
get O
back O
into O
weight O
lifting, O
like O
I O
did O
some O
in O
high O
school. O
[SEP]
I O
just O
want O
jeans O
that O
aren't O
huge O
at O
my O
feet O
and O
too O
tight O
at O
my O
waist. O
Or O
maybe O
a O
comfortable O
pair O
that O
aren't O
spandex! O
[SEP]
I O
feel O
like O
this O
is O
me! O
I O
have O
so O
many O
little O
things O
that O
I O
think O
I'll O
notice, O
I'm O
hoping O
I O
just O
reach O
a O
point O
where O
I'm O
just O
not O
tired. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
I'm O
just O
so O
ready O
for O
the O
surgery O
or O
even O
to O
get O
a O
date O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
mess O
anything O
up! O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
I'm O
certainly O
excited O
to O
trust O
the O
process, O
just O
this O
waiting... O
[SEP]
I O
just O
can't O
imagine O
being O
as O
small O
as O
what O
my O
"normal" O
says! O
I O
know O
it's O
possible, O
just O
hard O
to O
imagine. O
[SEP]
I O
love O
reading O
other O
people's O
NSV, O
especially O
ones O
like O
this! O
[SEP]
That's O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
my O
mindset. O
I O
don't O
want O
this O
to O
be O
another O
letdown O
in O
my O
life. O
I O
have O
NSVs O
I O
want O
to O
obtain, O
but O
my O
heart O
just O
isn't O
going O
to O
be O
set O
until O
they O
happen. O
I O
hope O
the O
work O
I O
put O
in O
pays O
off, O
just O
how O
it O
appears O
everyone O
else's O
has O
that O
I've O
seen O
on O
here! O

Dropping O

You’re O

I O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
went O
to O
the O
amusement O
park O
and O
gave O
up O
after O
the O
5th O
ride O
I O
couldn’t O
fit O
on. O
I O
used O
to O
go O
at O
least O
5-6 O
times O
a O
year. O
I O
haven’t O
been O
since O
and O
it’s O
been O
15 O
years. O
[SEP]
Same, O
I O
was O
always O
to O
heavy. O
Now O
it’s O
a O
goal! O
[SEP]
Yeah O
it’s O
absolutely O
insane, O
and O
impossible O
unless O
we O
are O
like O
skin O
and O
bones! O
I’m O
very O
happy O
where O
I O
am O
and O
I O
know O
once O
I O
get O
my O
skin O
removal O
(I O
have O
a O
ton O
from O
my O
previous O
apron O
belly) O
I O
will O
see O
a O
movement O
on O
the O
scale O
but O
I O
don’t O
really O
care O
about O
that. O
[SEP]
Haha O
yes! O
[SEP]
No, O
next O
Thursday! O
:D O
[SEP]
I O
didn't O
mean O
that O
comment O
to O
say O
that O
HAS O
to O
be O
your O
goal, O
i O
just O
meant O
when O
psych O

ask, O
that's O
a O

number O
to O
give. O

Oh, O

Good O

Did O
you O
have O
to O
do O
the O
psych O
consult, O
too? O
[SEP]
Oh, O
I O
know! O
I O
really O
hadn't O
thought O
about O
looking O
at O
a O
healthy O
BMI O
to O
put O
a O
number O
down O
until O
it O
was O
suggested. O
Then, O
when O
I O
did, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
freaked O
out. O
I O
know O
it's O
the O
"healthy" O
range, O
and O
being O
totally O
healthy O
is O
my O
goal, O
but O
those O
numbers O
just O
seemed O
low. O
I O
picked O
the O
higher O
end O
of O
my O
healthy O
range O
and O
used O
that O
number! O
My O
healthy O
range O
begins O
at O
98lbs, O
and O
well, O
that O
kind O
of O
number O
NEVER O
crossed O
my O
mind. O

Thank O
you! O

Maybe O
not O
the O

If O
not O

I’ll O
definitely O
be O

for O

2024. O
Maybe O
even O
by O

I’ll O
have O
had O
my O

removal. O

Unfortunately, O
all O

I O
would O
recommend O
seeing O
one O
for O
it O
as O
it O
is O
incredibly O
stubborn. O
I O
actually O
think O
my O
esthetician O
incorrectly O
increased O
the O
intensity O
of O
my O
products, O
when O
often O
maturation O
can O
be O
the O
result O
of O
the O
wrong O
products. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
use O
an O
app O
called O
“acne O
safe” O
to O
check O
the O
ingredients O
of O
all O
my O
products, O
so O
for O
your O
current O
routine O
I O
would O
check O
them O
out O
to O
make O
sure O
there O
is O
nothing O
comedogenic. O
During O
your O
pregnancy O
incorporating O
some O
mandelic O
acid O
or O
benzoyl O
peroxide O
might O
help O
if O
it O
is O
severe. O
At O
this O
point O
I O
only O
use O
a O
salicylic O
toner O
and O
occasional O
retinol O
or O
benzoyl O
peroxide, O
I O
found O
that O
with O
the O
right O
hydrating O
products O
and O
exfoliating O
a O
few O
times O
a O
week O
my O
skin O
responded O
better O
than O
when O
using O
actives O
several O
times O
a O
day. O

Paula’s O
choice O
also O
has O
some O
good O
products O
that O
shouldn’t O
make O
the O
maturation O
worse. O
Good O
luck O

Recommendations O
based O
on O
Handels O
Messiah O
[SEP]
I’ve O
recently O
delved O
into O
the O
world O
of O
classical O
music O
as O
my B-Family
in I-Family
laws I-Family
play I-Family
it I-Family
a I-Family
lot I-Family
to O
my B-Family
new I-Family
born I-Family
baby. I-Family
His O
overwhelming O
favourite O
seems O
to O
be O
Handels O
Messiah. O
So O
I’m O
hoping O
there O
are O
similar O
pieces O
I O
can O
explore O
as O
I’d O
like O
to O
listen O
to O
some O
other O
similar O
pieces. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Specifically O
I’m O
listening O
to O
this O
album O
on O
Spotify: O
https://open.spotify.com/album/4fMwLdKBFB0A2XjrB8vvM5?si=QKVnzJ9eSw6cGRTZnBxdUg O
[SEP]
Listen O
to O
Israel O
in O
Egypt! O
It’s O
just O
as O
good! O
[SEP]
--Try O
some O
of O
Handel's O
other O
oratorios, O
like O
*Israel O
in O
Egypt,* O
*Solomon,* O
*Saul,* O
and O
*Theodora* O
[SEP]
--Bach's O
*Mass O
in O
B O

Bach O
Christmas O

(especially O
the O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Probably O
most O
energetic O
baroque O
music O
like O
Vivaldi O
concertos O
(including O
but O
definitely O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
4 O
Seasons), O
Telemann O
overtures, O
pretty O
much O
anything O
by O
Jean O
Baptiste O
Lully O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Other O
Handel: O
try O
the O
coronation O
anthems. O
Maybe O
take O
a O
video O
of O
baby’s O
face O
the O
first O
time O
they O
hear O
Zadok O
the O
Priest O
(it O
builds O
then O
it O
explodes). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Suggestion O
that’s O
a O
little O
outside O
the O
box: O
Gilbert O
and O
Sullivan O
operas. O
Most O
of O
the O

holds O
up. O

Others O
have O
given O
great O
suggestions. O
I'll O
just O
add O
that O
Handel's O
Judas O
Maccabeus O
has O
some O
very O
catchy O
movements: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Just O
in O
Act O

finale O
that O
rivals O
the O
Amen O
chorus O
at O
the O
end O
of O
Messiah. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Saul O
is O
also O
wonderful, O
but O
darker. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Serse O
of O

contains O
Ombra O
Mai O

just O

beautiful. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Waft O
her O
gently O
from O
Jephtha O

so O

[SEP]
I O
don't O
know O
similar O
music O
but O
speaking O
of O
the O
Handel's O

I O
recommend O
conductor O

• O
Handel's O
other O
oratorios O
and O
operas. O
I O
like O
Rodelinda. O
Of O
course O
in O
the O
operas O
it's O
more O
solo O
arias O
and O
the O
occasional O
duet O
or O
trio. O
Not O
so O
many O
choirs O
as O
in O
the O
oratorios. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
• O
If O
you O
like O
the O
choirs O
in O
Handels O
Messiah, O
then O
you O
definitely O
should O
listen O
to O
**Bach**s O
cantatas O
and O
oratorios. O
I O
like O
BWV O
198, O
BWV O
34, O
BWV O
11 O
and O
many, O
many O
others, O
and O
would O
recommend O
those. O
Specifically O
for O
great O
choirs O
I'd O
mention O
the O
opening O
movements O
of O
BWV O
248, O
BWV O
72, O
BWV O
63, O
BWV O
5 O
and O
BWV O
109. O
Also O
the O
final O
movement O
of O
BWV O
191 O
and O
[the O
duet O
in O
BWV O
134](https://open.spotify.com/track/12h5B5BucNevnyGEB9Pkse?si=d60ed7d81e7d418a). O

• O
If O
you O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
it's O
not O
only O
very O
good, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very O
accessible, O
listen O
to O
Mozart's O
requiem O
if O
you O
haven't O
already. O
And O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
Pergolesi's O
Stabat O
Mater. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
• O
Other O
composers O
that O
you O
might O
want O
to O
try: O
Vivaldi, O
Charpentier, O
J.C. O
Bach, O
F.X. O
Richter, O
Purcell, O
Rameau, O
Cavalli, O
Caldara, O
Telemann, O

J.-H. O
Fiocco O
(search O
for O

Hasse O
and O
many O
others O
[SEP]
[SEP]
• O
Thomas O
Linley O
the O
younger's O
opening O
movement O
to O
The O
tempest, O
which O
isn't O
on O

There's O
[a O
recording O

[a O

video O
on O
youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uk9sNQAt4s). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
• O
I O
also O
really O
like O
W.F. O
Bach's O
cantata O
"Lasset O
uns O
ablegen O
die O
Werke O
der O
Finsternis" O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Edit: O
forgot O
to O
mention O
Homilius, O
whose O
solo O
arias O
sometimes O
have O
a O
Handel-like O
quality. O
[SEP]
Gratius O
agimus O
tibi! O
[SEP]
Handel's O
setting O
of O
*Dixit O
Dominus* O
very O
much O
sounds O
like O
a O
proto-Messiah. O
Lots O
of O
musical O
ideas O
that O
are O
going O
to O
make O
much O
more O
developed O
appearances O
in O
*Messiah* O
in O
their O
early O
stages. O
[SEP]
Never O
mind O
the O
why O
and O
wherefore! O
[SEP]
I O
second O
this. O
Period O
recordings O
of O
baroque O
and O
classical O
period O
pieces O
have O
a O
light O
bright O
feel, O
very O
characteristic O
of O
the O
piece. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
Trevor O
Pinnock's O
version. O
[SEP]
Thanks! O
I O
will O
check O
it O
out! O
[SEP]
Thanks, O
will O
have O
a O
listen O
👍 O
[SEP]
Oh O
damn, O
the O
Sixteen O
is O
my O
go O
to O
recording O
of O
Messiah! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But, O
the O
Matthias O
Passion O
is O
great, O
but, O
the O
Messe O
in O
h-moll O
is O
the O
best O
composition O
ever. O
😄 O
[SEP]
No O
BWV O
140? O
[SEP]
My O
pleasure! O
:) O
[SEP]
A O
lot O
of O
people O
think O
h-moll O
is O
#1. O
My O
argument O
for O
why O
st O
Matthew O
is O
higher O
is O
that O
the O
libretto O
is O
the O
greatest O
story O
ever O
told O
and O
the O
most, O
well, O
passionate O
- O
the O
passion O
of O
Christ. O
And O
its O
longer O
and O
it O
has O
a O
larger O
variety O
in O
its O
music. O
There O
are O
chorales, O
arias, O
recitativos, O
and O
combinations O
of O
the O
three. O
The O
mass O
only O
has O
arias O
and O
chorales. O
[SEP]
It's O
not O
in O
my O
top O
10 O
of O
favorite O
Bach O
cantatas, O
but O
the O
real O
reason O
I O
didn't O
mention O
it O
is O
I O
didn't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
useful O
to O
give O
a O
list O
of O
*35 O
cantatas O
you O
absolutely O
should O
listen O
to*. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
you're O
right O
that O
BWV O
140 O
maybe O
has O
more O
of O
a O
Messiah-vibe O
than O
some O
of O
the O
ones O
I O
did O
list. O
[SEP]
Oh O
I O
take O
your O
point, O
the O
Passion O
tells O
an O
amazing O
story O
(even O
if O
you're O
not O
a O
believer, O
it's O
a O
story O
of O
betrayal, O
suffering, O
sacrifice, O
and O
redemption), O
the O
same O
story O
the O
B-minor O
mass O
tells O
("Gloria O
in O
excelsis O
Deo", O
"Et O
resurrexit", O
etc.), O
but O
in O
a O
much O
more O
visceral O
way. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But... O
there's O
an O
amazing O
variety O
of O
styles O
in O
the O
B-minor, O
and O
Gratias O
agimus O
tibi.... O
[SEP]
[SEP]
😄 O
[SEP]
I'm O
going O
to O
listen O
to O
what O
you've O
listed! O
[SEP]
I O
suppose O
my O
main O
point O
is O
that O
the O
mass O
is O
only O
a O
musical O
work O
whereas O
the O
passion O
is O
a O
musical O
work O
with O
elements O
of O
other O
arts O
in O
it O
like O
theater O
and O
even O
painting O
if O
you O
include O
the O
music's O
ability O
to O
paint O
a O
picture O
with O
your O
imagination O
[SEP]

on O
zoloft O
that O
also O
is O
a O
highly O
sensitive O
person? O
[SEP]
Earlier O
this O
year O
I O
discovered O
that O
all O
the O
things O
I O
thought O
made O
me O
so O
different O
the O
way O
I O
experience O
the O
world O
was O
just O
because O
I'm B-Health
an I-Health
HSP I-Health
(about O
20% O
of O
the O
population O
is!). O
But O
now O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
identify O
why O
I O
experienced O
the O
world O
a O
certain O
way, O
I O
realized O
most B-Mental_Health
of I-Mental_Health
my I-Mental_Health
anxiety, I-Mental_Health
social I-Mental_Health
anxiety, I-Mental_Health
and I-Mental_Health
depression I-Mental_Health
came O
from O
this. O
Just O
wondering O
if O
anyone O
who's O
an O
HSP O
tried O
this O
drug O
and O
has O
has O
success O
in O
being O
able O
to O
manage O
their O
anxiety. O
I'm O
on O
day O
2, O
and O
so O
far O
so O
good, O
no O
changes O
but O
I O
didn't O
expect O
any O
just O
yet. O
[SEP]
Yes, O
high O
chance O
I O
am O
and O
the O
meds O
blunt O
my O
emotions. O
It O
makes O
it O
a O
lot O
easier O
to O
handle O
life O
in O
general. O
You O
can O
send O
me O
a O
message O
if O
u O
wanna O
chat. O
[SEP]
Yes, O
I'm B-Health
an I-Health
HSP I-Health
on I-Health
zoloft, I-Health
and O
will O
be O
undertaking O
an O
assessment O
for O
autism O
soon. O
I'm B-Occupation
also I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
mental I-Occupation
health I-Occupation
professional. I-Occupation
I O
found O
that O
zoloft O
balances O
my O
over O
reactivity O
to O
stimuli O
and O
just O
kinda... O
chills O
me O
out O
more. O
I O
also O
feel O
much O
more O
positive O
mood O
and O
greater O
motivation. O
Hope O
you O
have O
a O
good O
experience O
on O
it O
OP. O
Expect O
some O
weirdness O
in O
the O
first O
few O
weeks O
with O
side O
effects, O
but O
most O
should O
diminish O
with O
time. O
About O
2 O
months O
in O
is O
when O
I O
really O
started O
to O
feel O
better O
😄 O
[SEP]
Been O
on O
for O
a O
few O
months O
now. O
It’s O
awesome! O
I’d O
say O
I O
still O
retain O
the O
traits O
of O
HSP O
but O
I’m O
not O
feeling O
so O
anxious O
and O
depressed. O
I O
feel O
normal! O
It’s O
amazing O
I O
never O
knew O
I O
was O
such O
a O
neurotic O
wreck O
before O
until O
I O
got O
better O
😂 O
[SEP]
Omg O
I O
can’t O
wait O
to O
feel O
normal O
and O
not O
like O
I’m O
WIRED O
every O
second O
of O
every O
day. O
Now O
that O
I O
know O
where O
my O
anxiety/depression O
is O
stemming O
from, O
somehow O
I’m O
even O
more O
self O
aware O
and O
it’s O
not O
great O
😅 O
I’m O
so O
glad O
you’re O
having O
this O
experience O
[SEP]
All O
these O

make O

It O

dosage O
(made O
my O

from O
25 O
over O
six O

but O
was O
worth O
the O
trial O
and O
error. O
I O
am O
much O
happier O
and O
do O
not O
dwell O
on O
others O
peoples O
opinions O
and O
actions O
like O
I O

I O

I O
am O
and O
I’ve B-Health
been I-Health
on I-Health
Zoloft I-Health
for B-Time
4 I-Time
years. I-Time
I O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
therapy O
while B-Health
on I-Health
Zoloft I-Health
and O
recently O
started O
lowering O
my O
dose. O
I’m O
realizing O
Zoloft O
gave O
me O
the O
chance O
to O
learn O
tools O
to O
deal O
with O
how O
I O
feel O
my O
way O
through O
the O
world. O
Zoloft O
simply O
lowered O
the O
sound O
to O
all O
my O
feelings O
so O
I O
could O
process O
and O
learn O
tools. O
As O
I O
turn O
the O
volume O
back O
up O
I O
realize O
it O
is O
no O
where O
near O
as O
bad. O
Good O
luck O
op. O
[SEP]
Yes! O
I B-Health
discovered I-Health
I I-Health
was I-Health
HSP I-Health
after O
starting O
therapy O
and O
starting B-Health
taking I-Health
Zoloft. I-Health
Helped O
me O
find O
balance O
to O
move O
forward. O
For O
your O
info, O
the O
first O
month O
on O
Zoloft O
was O
really O
hard O
for O
me; O
hang O
in O
there O
🙂 O
[SEP]
Started O
couple O
a O
days O
ago O
on O
25mg, O
main O
issue O
is O
excessive O
worrying O
(as O
in: O
out O
of O
control) O
and O
anxiety; O
I O
must O
say O
the O
first O
pill O
I O
took O
I O
felt O
immediately O
(within O
10 O
minutes) O
working O
in O
on O
my O
nervous O
system. O
Right O
now O
I O
feel O
a O
little O
dizzy O
and O
out O
of O
this O
world, O
but O
I O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
support O
from O
my O
wife O
and O
colleagues O
at O
work, O
as O
I O
need O
to O
talk O
about O
my O
feelings O
all O
the O
time! O
I O
gave O
it O
a O
lot O
of O
consideration O
but O
at O
some O
point O
I O
had O
to O
draw O
the O
line O
and O
accept O
the O
fact O
that O
doing O
nothing O
wouldn't O
help O
me O
either. O
[SEP]
I’m O
glad O
you O
found O
your O
balance! O
Thanks O

for O
the O

[SEP]
Wow O
this O
sounds O
ideal O
[SEP]
Thanks O
so O
much O
for O
your O

That’s O
what O
I’m O
hoping O
for, O
to O
kind O
of O
turn O
down O
the O
volume O
while O
I O
learn O
how O
to O
properly O
deal O
with O
everything O
I O
process. O
Everytime O
I O
make O
some O
progress, O
overwhelming O
emotions O
take O
over. O
So O
I O
needed O
that O
calm O
down O
[SEP]
Thanks O
for O

me! O
I’m O
really O
glad O
to O

it O

Are O
you O

once O

I O
haven't O
played O
in O
years. O
How O
does O
Lawbringer O
play O
atm? O
[SEP]
When O
I O
used O
to O
play O
his O
kit O
was O
very O
narrow, O
but O
I B-Interests
am I-Interests
a I-Interests
huge I-Interests
history I-Interests
nerd I-Interests
which O
drew O
me O
to O
the O
game O
in O
the O
first O
place, O
and O
LB O
had O
the O
most O
"realistic" O
knightly O
moves O
and O
theme. O
Warden's O
kit O
revolved O
around O
his O
shoulder O
charge O
move O
and O
it O
looks O
silly O
to O
me. O
[SEP]
Even O
though O
LB O
moves O
were O
limited, O
he O
had O
a O
high O
HP O
pool, O
so O
to O
get O
better O
at O
him O
you O
had O
to O
be O
creative O
with O
baiting O
trades O
and O
mixups, O
and O
I O
grew O
to O
love O
that O
playstyle. O
[SEP]
Does O
lawbringer O
still O
play O
like O
this? O
If O
he O
was O
changed, O
what's O
his O
current O
playstyle? O
[SEP]
Are O
there O
any O
other O
characters O
that O
play O
similarly? O
[SEP]
He’s O
still O
the O
old O
defensive O
character. O
His O
shove O
is O
very O
safe O
to O
land, O
meaning O
it O
can’t O
be O
punished. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Hell, O
All O
of O
Lawbringers O
moves O
can’t O
be O
punished. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
try O
to O
dodge O
his O
heavy O
to O
guardbreak O
him, O
he’ll O
use O
his O
second O
chain O
heavy/light. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Even O
if O
you O
try O
to O
dodge O
his O
unblockable O
heavy O
and O
try O
to O
guardbreak O
him, O
he’ll O
follow O
that O
up O
with O
a O
shove. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Lawbringer O
is O
a O
mad O
defensive O
character…and O
his O
mighty O
catchphrase(Ad O
Mortem O
Inimicus) O
is O
still O
uttered O
gloriously O
on O
dominion. O
[SEP]
He's O
literally O
the O
same. O
No O
good O
openers. O
A O
decent O
dodge O
bash O
that O
recovers O
fast O
enough O
to O
allow O
him O
to O
punish O
some O
slow O
dodge O
attacks. O
Lower O
damage O
all O
around O
but O
his O
light O
parry O
still O
deals O
a O
lot O
compared O
to O
other O
heroes. O
He's O
pretty O
much O
the O
only O
turtle O
left O
in O
the O
game. O
[SEP]
Depending O
on O
when O
you O
last O
played O
he's O
either O
completely O
different O
or O
still O
the O
same. O
Right O
now O
he O
isn't O
very O
viable O
competitively O
because O
his O
offense O
is O
rather O
lacking O
as O
he O
has O
a O
hard O
time O
initiating O
offense O
and O
getting O
to O
his O
finishers. O
However O
his O
parry O
punishes O
are O
still O
really O
good. O
But O
this O
means O
that O
you O
are O
basically O
forced O
to O
play O
defensively O
as O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
characters O
have O
gotten O
better O
offense O
over O
time. O
But O
his O
core O
playstyle O
design O
has O
stayed O
the O
same. O
You'll O
just O
have O
to O
adjust O
to O
everything O
else O
that's O
been O
changed. O
[SEP]
LB O
hasn't O
changed O
much O
at O
all O
in O
recent O
years. O
The O
only O
change O
I O
can O
remember O
since O
his O
ancient O
rework O
is O
that O
he O
lost O
the O
hyperarmor O
on O
his O
shove. O
What O
has O
changed, O
though, O
is O
the O
game O
itself. O
Moves O
are O
faster, O
with O
much O
more O
of O
a O
focus O
given O
to O
making O
reads O
as O
opposed O
to O
just O
reacting O
to O
what O
an O
enemy O
is O
going O
to O
do. O
It O
may O
take O
some O
getting O
used O
to, O
but O
by O
and O
large, O
FH O
these O
days O
is O
much O
more O
offensive, O
whereas O
lawbringer O
back O
in O
the O
day O
was O
designed O
to O
be O
defensive, O
so O
he's O
a O
fairly O
weak O
character O
in O
the O
current O
meta. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
said, O
most O
of O
the O
balance O
in O
this O
game O
is O
pretty O
decent, O
so O
you O
can O
certainly O
use O
him O
to O
good O
effect. O
It's O
just, O
that O
thing O
you O
mentioned O
about O
having O
to O
bait O
people O
into O
things O
and O
punish O
them O
for O
it? O
That's O
now O
a O
much O
larger O
part O
of O
the O
game, O
rather O
than O
just O
a O
LB O
thing. O
You'll O
be O
doing O
that O
no O
matter O
who O
you O
play. O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
the O
game O
is O
in O
a O
good O
spot O
balance O
wise. O
Thanks O

Career O

[SEP]
I B-Occupation
currently I-Occupation
work I-Occupation
in I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
proprietary I-Occupation
Software I-Occupation
Support I-Occupation
role I-Occupation
for I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
large I-Occupation
company, I-Occupation
I O
am O
due O
a O
raise O
and O
review O
in O
January O
and O
have O
been O
given O
responsibility O
over O
some O
automation O
options O
and O
analysis O
of O
our O
chat O
bot. O
I O
have O
been O
given O
an O
offer O
that O
I O
must O
respond O
to O
in O
48 O
hours O
for O
a O
Help O
Desk O
position O
at O
a O
large O
government O
contractor. O
The O
new O
role O
Would O
shift O
to O
general O
help O
desk, O
offer O
a O
2.5k O
raise, O
maintain O
my O
current O
benefits, O
support O
a O
secret O
clearance O
(biggest O
deal O
for O
me) O
but O
I O
would O
also O
could O
very O
likely O
end O
up O
at O
3rd O
shift O
or O
other O
similarly O
odd O
hours. O
My O
questions O
are O
as O
follows: O
[SEP]
1. O
Is O
the O
new O
experience O
worth O
the O
switch? O
[SEP]
2. O
Would O
my O
current O
job O
be O
better O
for O
a O
future O
in O
development? O
[SEP]
3. O
How O
valuable O
is O
experience O
with O
government O
work O
at O
a O
secret O
clearance O
level? O
[SEP]
4. O
Should O
I O
speak O
to O
my O
current O
manager O
about O
the O
possible O
raise O
and O
review? O
[SEP]
5. O
Should O
I O
worry O
about O
failing O
to O
receive O
the O
clearance O
and O
therefore O
having O
left O
my O
job O
for O
no O
reason? O
[SEP]
6.Is O
there O
any O
more O
information O
I O
could O
gather O
that O
could O
help O
my O
decision? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
to O
anyone O
who O
reads O
and O
replies. O
I’m O
at O
a O
loss. O
[SEP]
To O
me O
it O
sounds O
like O
the O
job O
you O
have O
is O
better O
than O
the O
one O
you're O
going O
for O
(you O
can O
probably O
get O
a O
2.5k O
raise O
in O
the O
review), O
but O
there O
is O
value O
in O
having O
a O
security O
clearance. O
You O
can O
always O
take O
the O
new O
job, O
work O
for O
a O
short O
period O
then O
apply O
to O
better O
positions O
such O
as O
something O
in O
development O
if O
you O
like. O
Having O
the O
clearance O
makes O
finding O
better O
and O
higher O
paying O
jobs O
easy, O
and O
if O
you O
can O
find O
one O
that O
will O
sponsor O
upgrading O
your O
secret O
to O
a O
TS O
that's O
even O
better O
(although O
doing O
this O
will O
most O
likely O
eliminate O
almost O
any O
fully O
remote O
jobs O
if O
that's O
important O
to O
you). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
for O
failing O
to O
receive O
the O
clearance, O
I O
wouldn't O
worry O
unless O
you O
know O
there's O
something O
that O
would O
eliminate O
you. O
Things O
like O
undisclosed O
drug O
use O
coming O
to O
light, O
criminal O
background O
history, O
and O
being O
in O
serious O
debt. O
By O
that O
I O
mean O
having O
bills O
120+ O
days O
behind O
and O
being O
in O
collections. O
If O
you O
have O
a O
clean O
background O
then O
there's O
no O
reason O
why O
it O
wouldn't O
go O
through. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Just O
give O
it O
some O
thought. O
If O
you O
don't O
like O
where O
you O
are O
then O
it's O
a O
no O
brainer O
to O
leave. O
If O
you O
do, O
you O
can O
give O
it O
some O
time O
to O
possibly O
find O
a O
better O
job O
that O
will O
sponsor O
a O
clearance, O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
take O
the O
first O
one O
offered. O
[SEP]
Clearance O
is O
invaluable. O
Just O
work O
there O
long O
enough O
to O
get O
one, O
and O
then O
you're O
golden. O
[SEP]
My O
experience O
working O
in O
the O
Federal O
contractor O
space O
was O
terrible. O
Wouldn't O
wish O
those O
jobs O
on O
my O
worst O
enemy. O
[SEP]
This O
really O
helped O
ease O
my O
anxiety O
about O
the O
decision O
[SEP]
Even O
worth O
leaving O
a O
chill O
and O
good O
job O
for O
one O
potentially O
much O
busier O
and O
with O
a O
possibly O
MUCH O
worse O
schedule? O
[SEP]
My O
experience O
is O
the O
opposite. O
I'm B-Occupation
a I-Occupation
federal I-Occupation
contractor I-Occupation
now, I-Occupation
my I-Occupation
first I-Occupation
IT I-Occupation
job I-Occupation
was I-Occupation
working I-Occupation
for I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
fortune I-Occupation
100 I-Occupation
tech I-Occupation
company. I-Occupation
I O
have O
no O
desire O
to O
go O
back. O
The O
only O
main O
downside O
is O
that O
I O
can't O
wfh O
100% O
of O
the O
time O
since O
my O
job O
requires O
TS/SCI O
clearance O
and O
there O
are O
things O
I O
can O
only O
do O
in O
a O
SCIF. O
But O
it's O
easy O
and O
the O
pay O
is O
great O
so O
it O
makes O
up O
for O
it. O
[SEP]
Yes O
imo O
[SEP]
Should O
I O
have O
worries O
about O
failing O
to O
get O
the O
clearance O
and O
losing O
the O
opportunity? O
I O
have O
been O
open O
with O
people O
that O
know O
that O
I O
have O
very O
far O
left O
political O
stances O
and O
I’m O
sure O
that O
can O
be O
found O
out O
about O
me… O
but O
I O
have O
great O
credit O
and O
have O
no O
criminal O
history. O

What O

that O

voluntary(before B-Sexual_Orientation

even O
though O
I O

the O

itself O
was O

I O
was O

that O
what O
he O
said O
made O
you O
upset, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
just O
a O
joke. O

I O
like O
to O
imagine O
the O
tone O
of O
which O
the O
person O
would O
be O
saying O
it O
in O
if O
it O
were O
in O
person. O
99% O
of O
the O
time, O
it’s O
that O
light-hearted O
joking-ness O
that O
I O
hear. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you!!! O
Most O
of O
the O
time O
I O
know O
he’s O
joking O
but O
there’s O
always O
that O
little O
voice O
in O
the O
back O
of O
my O
head O
saying O
the O
basic O
stuff O
like O
“he O
means O
it.” O
“Lash O
out” O
“he’s O
trying O
to O
be O
mean.” O

What O
I O
am O
about O
to O

is O
not O
exactly O
Neville O

basically O
it's O
still O
proof O

Anyway O
I B-Health
had I-Health
back I-Health
problems I-Health
for I-Health
most I-Health
of I-Health
my I-Health
life I-Health
now. I-Health
I O
was O
convinced O
it O
was O
from O
me O
growing O
up O
gaming O
and O
spending O
lot O
of O
time O
sitting O
in O
awkward O
positions O
which O
caused O
slight O
curvature O
in O
my O
back. O
When O
school O
started O
those O
school O
desks O
that O
I O
refer O
to O
as O
back O
breakers O
didn't O
help O
at O
all. O
Sitting O
in O
them O
for O
years O
and O
years O
caused O
me O
even O
more O
back O
pain O
and O
I O
was O
convinced O
this O
is O
never O
gonna O
go O
away. O
I B-Age
am I-Age
now I-Age
almost I-Age
29 I-Age
years I-Age
old I-Age
and O
I O
am O
working O
12 O
hrs O
a O
day O
and O
I O
accepted O
this O
was O
gonna O
be O
something O
I O
am O
gonna O
deal O
with O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life. O
At O
best O
I O
hoped O
it O
would O
stay O
same O
and O
not O
get O
worse O
so O
I O
"learned" O
to O
live O
with O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Anyway O
few O
months O
back O
out O
of O
nowhere O
it O
got O
so O
bad O
and O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
for O
it O
to O
be O
this O
bad O
since O
I O
stopped O
working O
out, O
or O
doing O
anything O
that O
would O
cause O
this O
amount O
of O
pain O
or O
damage O
to O
my O
back. O
It O
got O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
couldn't O
even O
sit O
anymore, O
pain O
was O
getting O
unbearable, O
and O
at O
work O
I O
struggled O
to O
lift O
even O
empty O
boxes O
without O
bending O
in O
awkward O
positions O
and O
going O
through O
excruciating O
pain O
when O
sitting O
back O
up. O
I O
took O
vacation O
for O
3 O
weeks O
but O
it O
didn't O
get O
any O
better, O
only O
worse. O
I O
would O
mostly O
just O
lay O
in O
my O
bed O
and O
hope O
it O
goes O
way O
but O
it O
didn't. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
hope O
this O
is O
not O
too O
much O
info O
but O
one O
day O
I O
couldn't O
even O
go O
to O
bathroom O
because O
sitting O
down O
put O
me O
in O
excruciating O
pain. O
I O
tried O
my O
best O
to O
take O
shower O
but O
I O
couldn't O
bend O
down O
to O
take O
off O
my O
socks O
and O
this O
is O
when O
I O
had O
enough O
of O
this O
BS. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
sat O
back O
and O
tried O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
happened, O
did O
I O
damage O
some O
disc O
in O
my O
back, O
maybe O
some O
nerve O
damage O
or O
what O
is O
causing O
this? O
There O
has O
to O
be O
a O
reason. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
eventually O
realized O
similar O
thing O
happened O
many O
times O
in O
my O
life. O
I O
had O
once O
excruciating O
pain O
in O
my O
wrist O
for O
a O
week O
where O
I O
couldn't O
even O
use O
mouse O
or O
computer O
and O
recently O
even O
had O
so O
much O
pain O
in O
my O
right O
foot O
that O
I O
was O
limping O
for O
week O
and O
thought O
I O
broke O
my O
foot. O
So O
what O
was O
causing O
all O
this? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
realized O
it O
was O
emotions. O
I O
know O
now O
many O
of O
you O
will O
roll O
your O
eyes O
and O
say O
get O
the O
fuck O
out O
of O
here O
with O
that O
Law O
of O
Attraction O
BS, O
and O
trust O
me O
I O
would O
once O
say O
that O
too O
but O
it's O
true. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
realized O
it O
was O
anger, O
regret, O
anxiety. O
Every O
time O
I O
would O
feel O
these O
emotions O
it O
would O
fire O
up O
pain O
in O
my O
body O
instantly O
and O
my O
life O
these O
days O
is O
going O
to O
shit O
so O
I O
felt O
so O
much O
anger O
and O
regret O
and O
it O
caused O
all O
this O
pain. O
I O
realized O
I O
kept O
bottling O
up O
these O
emotions O
and O
never O
expressing O
them O
and O
my O
body O
was O
trying O
to O
tell O
me O
something. O
I O
knew O
there O
is O
something O
to O
this O
so O
I O
googled O
it. O
I O
researched O
all O
this O
and O
realized O
there O
are O
some O
people O
who O
realized O
the O
same O
thing. O
I O
even O
checked O
this O
sub O
and O
found O
one O
post O
that O
said O
the O
same O
thing, O
how O
they O
healed O
their O
back O
pain O
with O
book O
called O
"Healing O
back O
pain O
by O
John O
Sarno" O
and O
I O
found O
it O
on O
YT O
and O
listened. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
knew O
he O
was O
telling O
the O
truth O
because O
I O
realized O
this O
my O
self. O
I O
kept O
listening O
and O
listening O
and O
listening O
and O
it O
made O
more O
sense O
every O
time O
and O
in O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
all O
pain O
was O
gone. O
I O
was O
in O
so O
much O
pain O
while O
listening O
to O
this O
book, O
I O
tried O
fighting O
off O
my O
mind O
that O
kept O
telling O
me O
this O
is O
BS O
and O
how O
my O
back O
is O
not O
gonna O
get O
better O
and O
how O
something O
is O
broken/damaged O
and O
I O
can't O
fix O
it O
with O
my O
mind O
alone. O
I O
kept O
bending O
down O
despite O
excruciating O
pain O
and O
I O
didn't O
let O
my O
mind O
win O
this O
time. O
I O
even O
went O
to O
workout O
and O
I O
couldn't O
lift O
my O
dumbells O
off O
floor O
with O
my O
arms O
because O
pain O
was O
too O
much O
but O
I O
would O
bend O
in O
very O
awkward O
positions O
and O
knew O
I O
had O
to O
beat O
my O
mind O
and O
pain O
was O
not O
real O
so O
I O
would O
lift O
them O
up O
any O
way O
I O
could O
and O
workout. O
I O
went O
to O
sleep O
and O
woke O
up O
with O
same O
pain O
but O
I O
didn't O
give O
up O
and O
during O
the O
day O
it O
just O
went O
away. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
swear O
I O
am O
not O
making O
this O
up. O
I O
just O
couldn't O
accept O
this O
shit O
anymore O
and O
I O
had O
to O
change O
it O
at O
any O
cost. O
Now O
I O
have O
0 O
pain O
and O
If O
I O
accepted O
what O
my O
mind O
told O
me O
I O
would O
prob O
now O
be O
laying O
down O
on O
my O
bed O
and O
praying O
to O
die O
from O
all O
that O
pain. O
[SEP]
Hey O
I O
believe O
it. O
I O
think O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
are O
psychosomatic. O
Do O
you O
mind O
sharing O
how O
you O
released O
those O
emotions O
or O
what O
you O
did O
specifically O
[SEP]
Awesome! O
Now O
keep O
that O
momentum! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It’s O
not O
BS, O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
scientific O
evidence O
on O
Psychosomatic O
injuries O
which O
is O
what O
you O
are O
describing. O
Our O
minds O
are O
powerful O
tools. O
LOA, O
Neville O
Goddard, O
and O
others O
just O
call O
it O
something O
different O
and O
maybe O
add O
a O
little O
flair O
but O
they O
are O
all O
very O
similar O
concepts. O
Humans O
are O
limitless O
in O
their O
abilities. O
We O
just O
*think* O
we O
aren’t. O
Once O
we O
think O
we O
can O
do O
something, O
we O
can. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
want O
to O
push O
further, O
look O
into O
working O
on O
your O
mental O
diet. O
Changing O
those O
negative O
thought O
patterns O
changes O
your O
whole O
life O
and O
literally O
builds O
those O
new O
neural O
pathways O
in O
the O

Doctor O

I O
had O
full-body O
pain O

The O

symptom O
was O
burning O
skin O
from O

After O

Wow O
that's O
amazing O
I O
hope O
this O
isn't O
one O
of O
those O
fake O
it O
till O
you O
make O
it O
scripting O
stories O
because O
dude O
results O
in O
24 O
hrs O
thats O
really O
astonishing O
😭 O
i O
personally O
got O
rid O
of O
my O
back O
nerve O
pain O
although O
it O
wasn't O
that O
sevre O
but O
as O
i O
stopped O
thinking O
about O
it O
and O
just O
declared O
i O
don't O
have O
it O
anymore O
within O
a O
month O
or O
few O
weeks O
i O
don't O
remember O
properly O
now O
but O
yeah O
it O
totally O
went O
away O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also O
i O
totally O
beleive O
in O
the O
stuff O
you O
are O
talking O
about. O
Infact O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
people O
especially O
some O
manifestation O
coach O
who O
talks O
about O
energy O
stuff O
and O
all O
. O
They O
got O
results O
like O
lighter O
eye O
colour O
, O
change O
in O
voice O
etc O
once O
they O
started O
doing O
energy O
work O
. O
It's O
surreal O
how O
our O
mind-body O
can O
do O
so O
much O
but O
we O
limit O
it O
with O
3 O
d O
and O

No O
this O
is O
true. O
It’s O
all O
basically O
pointing O
out O
to O
the O
same O
truth O
that O
your O
inner O
world O
shapes O
your O
outer O
world. O
And O
emotions O
are O
part O
of O
the O
as O
well. O
If O
know O
how O
to O
feel O
our O
emotions O
without O
resisting O
them O
which O
is O
pretty O
hard O
especially O
with O
uncomfortable O
emotions O
like O
sadness O
or O
anger, O
then O
we O
won’t O
even O
manifest O
bodily O
pain O
or O
mental O
diseases. O
I O
personally O
used O
to O
have O
these O
unbearable O
headaches O
and O
then O
I O
realized O
that O
the O
root O
cause O
of O
it O
is O
repressed O
anger. O
Like O
my O
belief O
in O
the O
wrongness O
of O
anger O
manifests O
as O
headaches. O
I O
started O
looking O
into O
why O
I O
believe O
anger O
is O
bad O
and O
how O
I O
can O
feel O
my O
anger. O
Every O
time O
I O
get O
headaches O
I O
ask O
myself O
what O
am O
I O
angry O
at. O
By O
making O
my O
pain O
conscious O
and O
releasing O
it, O
I O
am O
relieved O
of O
unconscious O
need O
to O
manifest O
pain O
for O
myself. O
I O
have O
gotten O
really O
good O
at O
it O
that O
I O
don’t O
even O
experience O
headaches O
any O
more. O
[SEP]
Truth O
is O
that O
we O
are O
conditioned O
to O
think O
emotions O
are O
bad O
and O
they O
mess O
things O
up O
while O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
they O
are O
just O
guiding O
you O
to O
see O
what O
you O
truly O
feel. O
They O
are O
not O
to O
be O
hold O
on O
to O
but O
rather O
felt. O
[SEP]
And O
in O
your O
case O
with O
the O
back O
pain, O
that’s O
absolutely O
true. O
It’s O
pent O
up O
emotions O
that O
feel O
like O
a O
burden O
which O
is O
why O
it O
manifests O
as O
back O
pain. O
It’s O
truly O
remarkable O
how O
we O
intelligent O
our O
bodies O
are. O
We O
just O
need O
to O
be O
better O
at O
listening O
to O
it. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
unrelated, O
but O
I O
haven't O

[SEP]

[SEP]
Congrats! O
[SEP]
I O
think O
more O
than O
anything O
it O
was O
just O
realization O
that O
the O
pain O
wasn't O
real. O
There O
wasn't O
any O
damage O
in O
my O
back, O
nothing O
was O
wrong O
with O
me. O
My O
mind O
was O
doing O
all O
this. O
I O
did O
feel O
intense O
relief O
and O
relaxation O
upon O
this O
realization O
so O
I O
guess O
I O
did O
release O
other O
emotions O
simultaneously O
too. O
[SEP]
This! O
I O
don’t O
understand O
the O
hate O
for O
loa O
because O
it’s O
just O
a O
slightly O
different O
approach O
to O
the O
same O
thing. O
How O
I O
see O
it O
Neville O
just O
turned O
this O
principle O
into O
a O
very O
practical O
guide. O
[SEP]
Coming O
from O
the O
loa, O
when O
I O
started O
to O
study O
Neville O
there O
was O
nothing O
I O
didn’t O
know O
before, O
just O
some O
more O
practical O
techniques O
and O
sometimes O
things O
just O
worded O
in O
a O
way O
that O
made O
me O
understand O
it O
on O
a O
new O
level. O

May O
I O
ask, O
was O
it O
just O
your O
newfound O
awareness O
that O
it O
was O
psychosomatic O
that O
"cured" O
it? O
Or O
did O
you O
also O
do O

something O

release O
the O

Trust O
me O
it's O
not O
fake. O
I O
would O
not O

[SEP]
Not O

It's O
just O
an O

Yea, O
there O
is O
also O
science O
behind O
it. O
If O
you O
take O
out O
the O
energy O

religion O
pieces, O
perception O
and O
therefore O
reality O
really O
is O
subjective. O
Tons O
of O
tedtalks O
on O
changing O
thought O
patterns O
and O
changing O
your O
perceptions. O
At O
the O
basic O
bare O
bones O
level, O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
comes O
down O
to O
re-wiring O
your O
brain O
and O
getting O
out O
of O
negative O
thought O
patterns. O
The O
basic O
concepts O
behind O
these O
things O
are O
all O
the O
same, O
we O
are O
the O
master O
of O
our O
own O

therefore O
our O

our O

Well, O
at O
the O
very O
least O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
overlap, O
and O
it O
might O
depend O
on O
what O
loa O
coach O
you’re O
following. O
I O
don’t O
think O
I’ve O
heard O
Hicks O
say O
that O
the O
universe O
decides. O
And O
to O
quote O
Neville: O
“your O
dimensionally O
larger O
self O
speaks O
to O
you O
through O
the O
language O
of O
desire. O
Do O
not O
de O
deceive O
yourself. O
Knowing O
what O
you O
want, O
claim O
you O
already O
have O
it, O
for O
it O
is O
your O
Father’s O
good O
pleasure O
to O
give O
it O
to O
you” O
which O
sounds O
to O
me O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
when O
Hicks O
talks O
about O
your O
higher O
being, O
or O
could O
be O
interpreted O
as O
‘the O
universe’. O
And O
I O
know O
Neville O
says O
you O
can O
manifest O
without O
lifting O
a O
finger, O
but O
I O
feel O
like O
taking O
inspired O
action O
could O
be O
the O
same O
thing O
or O
very O
similar O
to O
Neville’s O
bridge O
of O
incidents. O
And O
when O
they O
say O
vibration O
attracts, O
in O
my O
interpretation O
it O
is O
basically O
like O
Neville’s O
state. O
When O
I O
focus O
on O
everything O
that O
is O
going O
right O
for O
me, O
and O
everything O
I O
have O
and O
love, O
instead O
of O
everything O
I O
lack O
and O
dislike, O
I O
am O
in O
the O
state O
of O
having O
and O
loving, O
giving O
me O
more O
things O
to O
have O
and O
love, O
or O
at O
least O
that’s O
how O
my O
experience O
has O
been. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
while O
I O
don’t O
really O
disagree O
with O
you, O
I O
don’t O
think O
I’m O
entirely O
wrong O
either, O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
this O
might O
have O
to O
do O
with O
how O
I O
personally O
interpret O
and O
experience O
things O

The O

no O

we O

[SEP]
what O
we O
even O
do O
in O

also O
hangouts. O

I O
don't O

why O

I O

there O
just O
hasn't O
been O
anyone O
to O
step O
up. O

There's O
definitely O
a O
big O

Hi O
Thnx O
to O
all O
for O
being O
concerned O
about O
UB. O
And O
this O
is O
just O
an O
opinion O
UB O
grad O
and O
very O
shocked O
that O
UB O
has O
an O
issue O
with O
reasonable O
accommodation O
for O
all. O
My O
thing O
is O
joined O
Schussmeister O
about O
10 O
years O
ago O
for O
the O
season O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
refund O
or O
credit O
to O
next O
season O
as O
my O
physical O
condition O
changed O
rapidly. O
Well O
documented O
letter O
from O
Doc O
about O
degenerative O
condition. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
the O
club O
prez O
rudely O
dismissed O
my O
concern. O
Just O
saying. O
Wishing O
all O
the O
best. O
[SEP]
I O
had O
no O
idea O
about O
that! O
But O
unfortunately O
SA O
doesn’t O
let O
you O
resurrect O
an O
old O
club O
unlike O
other O
schools. O
A O
new O
club O
with O
a O
different O
name O
has O
to O
be O
formed. O
[SEP]
What O
would O
an O
LGBTQ O
club O
do? O
What O
would O
a O
Latin O
American O
club O
do? O
These O
clubs O
can O
bring O
people O
of O
a O
shared O
identity O
together, O
and O
that O
alone O
can O
be O
powerful. O
But O
they O
can O
also O
be O
advocates O
for O
change O
on O
campus, O
create O
safe O
spaces O
for O
marginalized O
students, O
or O
just O
be O
a O
space O
for O
people O
to O
have O
fun, O
watch O

organize O
trips, O
eat O
good O
food, O
etc. O
Though O
I O
am O
not O
disabled O
I O
imagine O
there's O
a O
LOT O
such O
a O
club O
could O
do O
such O
as O
organizing O
trips O
that O
are O
friendly O
to O
disabled O
people O
around O
the O
Buffalo O
area, O
advocating O
for O
better O
accessibility O
on O
campus, O
and O
creating O
an O
environment O
where O
people O
who O
struggle O
with O
a O
disability O
can O
connect O
and O
find O
community O
on O

open O

I O
would O
love O

It O

accessibility O
resources. O

No O
you O
can O
bring O
back O
an O

name. O
It’s O
the O

process O
as O

you O
can O
use O
their O
premade O
constitution. O

met) O
[SEP]
Exactly. O
Nobody O
questions O
any O
other O

There O
is O
a O
fucking O
lettuce O
club, O
nobody O
questions O
their O

existence O
(no O

anyone O

Everybody O
is O
all O
about O
DEI O
at O
this O
damn O
school O
until O

brought O
up. O
People O
either O
ignore O

dismiss O
our O
needs O
(Example: O
UB O
and O
the O
food O
allergies,guess O
what, O

are O

they O
treat O
us O

To O

anyone O
who O

what, O
everyone O

a O
chance O

joining O
the O

at O
any O

it’s O

I’ve O

I’ve O
hit O
a O
point O
where O
I O
feel O
overwhelmed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Spiraling O
thoughts O
that O
I O
can’t O
seem O
to O
shake O
off. O
Overwhelming/drowning O
feeling O
about O
job O

I O

logically O
what’s O
going O

I O
used O

away O
my O
issues. O
Like O
I O
could O
recognize O
what O
caused O
spiraling O

and O
stop O
them O
but O
it’s O
just O
not O
helping O
right O
now O
because O
of O
how O
overwhelming O
things O
are. O

Deep O

I O

At O

you O

changes. O
Otherwise O
it’s O
overwhelming. O
What O
thing O
can O
you O
do O
today O
to O
make O
things O
1% O
better O
for O
tomorrow? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
would O
say O
for O
now O
that’s O
to O
eat. O
Make O
sure O
you O
have O
something O
small O
for O
breakfast O
each O
day. O
That’s O
your O
challenge. O
Then O
for O
lunch. O
Then O
for O
dinner. O
Not O
a O
amazing O
meal O
for O
now O
but O
the O
rhythm O
of O
eating. O
Then O
challenge O
yourself O
to O
make O
a O
little O
more O
effort. O
Healthier O
food. O
New O
food. O
But O
each O
time O
one O
small O
step. O
[SEP]

Music O
try O
ambient O
noise O
lists O
on O

or O
Spotify. O
Or O
lofi O
music. O
It’s O
much O
of O
nothing O
but O
not O
silence. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
your O
spiralling O
thoughts, O
distractions O
are O
good. O
But O
that O
depends O
what O
you O
enjoy O
and O
what O
you O
are O
able O
to O
do. O
A O
sport. O
A O
walk. O
Or O
if O
you O
can O
try O
to O
go O
1 O
min O
of O
breathing. O
Again O
not O
30 O
mins O
but O
one O
min. O
Then O
two. O
Then O
three. O
Steps O
each O
time. O
When O
your O
ten O
mins O
in O
remembering O
you O
started O
at O
1. O
Small O
steps. O
Maybe O
write O
down O
in O
a O
diary O
or O
a O
bit O
of O
paper O
so O
you O
see O
the O
progress O
as O
it’s O
hard O
remember O
where O
you O
started. O

Lastly O
nobody O
has O
it O
figured O
out. O
Some O
get O
through O
it O
better. O
Some O
get O
more O
luck O
but O
I O
have O
met O
people O
from O
all O
walks O
of O
life O
when O
you O
get O
into O
it O
have O
or O
have O
had O
issues. O
Keep O
doing O
one O
step O
and O
when O
you O
walk O
backwards O
that’s O
fine O
because O
your O
walk O
forward O
again. O
[SEP]

I O
hope O
you O
get O
the O

lately O
ive O
been O
watching O
predator O
catchers O
on O
youtube O
(like O
when O
they O
pose O
as O
minors O
to O
catch O
predators O
in O
the O
act O
of O
attempting O
to O
meet O
up O
with O
them O
for O
sex) O
and O
something O
that O
really O
helped O
me O
reframe O
my O
thinking O
surrounding O
the B-Personal_Experiences
sexual I-Personal_Experiences
assault I-Personal_Experiences
i I-Personal_Experiences
recently I-Personal_Experiences
suffered I-Personal_Experiences
is O
that O
whenever O
the O
predators O
start O
making O
excuses O
and O
say O
shit O
like O
"i O
made O
a O
mistake" O
theyre O
immediately O
called O
out O
and O
told O
"no, O
you O
didnt O
make O
a O
mistake. O
you O
made O
a O
choice". O
it O
just O
really O
put O
things O
in O
perspective O
for O
me O
and O
helped O
me O
stop O
making O
so O
many O
excuses O
for O
my O
ex O
and O
its O
helped O
me O
stop O
blaming O
myself O
so O
much O
(obviously O
im O
not O
fully O
to O
this O
point O
in O
my O
healing O
journey O
yet O
but O
again O
its O
been O
helpful). O
cuz O
yeah, O
my O
ex O
absolutely O
had O
control O
over O
his O
own O
actions O
and O
he O
chose O
to O
ignore O
my O
boundaries O
and O
chose O
to O
pressure O
me O
into O
sex O
while O
knowing O
i O
didnt O
want O
it. O
idk O

this O
will O

I O
would O

those O

If O

looking O
for O
stuff O
on O

side, O
imo O
ColourPop O
is O
amazing O
for O
the O

have O
some O

mental O

find O
something O
that O
fits O
in O

still O
branching O

a O

the O

My B-Pet

Are O

How O
do O
you O
teach O
a O

“quiet” O
if O

bark O
at O

Also, O
if O
outside O
she’s O

if O

up O
barking. O
Should O
we O

a O

we O

When O

you O

[SEP]
Hi O
everyone! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
father, O
uncle O
and O
I O
are O
keen O
to O
look O
into O
some O
family O
history. O
I B-Religion
did I-Religion
not I-Religion
grow I-Religion
up I-Religion
Jewish I-Religion
and I-Religion
converted I-Religion
as I-Religion
an I-Religion
adult. I-Religion
Since O
I've O
converted, O
my O
uncle O
has O
come O
to O
speak O
to O
me O
about O
something O
I'd O
not O
heard O
regarding O
our O
family O
history: O
my B-Family
great-grandmother I-Family
(and I-Family
therefore I-Family
my I-Family
paternal I-Family
grandmother) I-Family
were I-Family
apparently I-Family
Jewish. I-Family
We O
have O
absolutely O
no O
documented O
evidence O
of O
this, O
however. O
We're B-Race_Nationality
from I-Race_Nationality
a I-Race_Nationality
country I-Race_Nationality
in I-Race_Nationality
the I-Race_Nationality
former I-Race_Nationality
Yugoslavia, I-Race_Nationality
and O
so O
any O
evidence O
would O
have O
been O
disposed O
of O
during O
WWII O
in O
order O
to O
protect O
them O
from O
persecution. O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
feasible O
it O
is- O
but O
I O
also O
don't O
know O
how O
this O
story O
would O
have O
started O
if O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
it O
either. O

Has O
anyone O
got O
any O
experience O
with O
looking O
into O
things O
like O
this? O
I'm O
at O
a O
loss O
at O
where O
to O
start. O
My B-Family
great-grandmother I-Family
was I-Family
born I-Family
in I-Family
Austria- I-Family
should O
I O
start O
there? O
[SEP]
Austrian O
here. O
It’s O
mandatory O
for O
every O
inhabitant O
to O
have O
their O
permanent O
address O
registered O
with O
the O
authorities O
at O
all O
times O
and O
has O
been O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
- O
meaning O
since O
well O
into O
the O
imperial O
era, O
though O
historic O
consistency O
could O
be O
compromised O
if O
the O
place O
of O
residence O
ended O
up O
being O
part O

at O
some O
point O
after O

If O
you O

the O

ask O
them O

help O
finding O
the O
historic O

This O

be O
independent O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Registering O
personal O
data O
like O
religion O
was O
obligatory O
until O

recently, O
so O
if O
your O

was O
indeed O
Jewish, O
it O
will O
say O
mosaisch O

in O
the O

My O

you O
can O

(bear O
in O

you O

believe O
it O
or O
not O
the O

is O
a O
really O
good O
resource. O
They O
have O
one O
of O
the O

they O

I O
will O
also O
say O
don't O
worry O
about O
not O
knowing O
where O
to O
start. O
Its O
a O
lot O
of O
detective O
work. O
For O
my O
mom, O
the O
process O
took O
time, O
sometimes O
progression O
was O
slow, O
only O
finding O
documents O
piecemeal, O
other O
times O
she'd O
find O
a O
document O
and O
make O
a O
bunch O
of O
breakthroughs. O
Either O
way, O
its O
really O
worth O
the O
effort. O
and O
Good O
luck O
:) O
[SEP]
I O
would O
start O
by O
taking O
a O
DNA O
test. O
If O
she's O
Ashkenazi, O
you'll O
get O
clear O
confirmation O
of O
it O
from O
the O
test. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
also O
look O
through O
matches O
and O
their O

to O
see O
if O
you O
find O
anything. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
done O
a O
completely O
document O
trail O

my O
family O
tree. O
If O
you O
know O
your O
grandparents' O
names O
and O
birth O
years/ O
other O
family O
members O
it O
is O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
paper O
trail. O
[SEP]
All O
the O
good O
advice O
has O
already O
been O
given; O
just O
chiming O
in O
to O
say O
that O
this O
is O
very O
plausible, O
in O
case O
(as O
I O
perceive O
from O
what O
you O
wrote) O
you're O
skeptical. O
Many O
Ashkenazi O
Jews O
from O
Austrian-ruled O
parts O
of O
Europe O
(Bukovina, O
Galicia, O
Austria O
proper) O
ended O
up O
in O
Serbia O
well O
along O
the O
path O
to O
assimilation O
and O
usually O
conversion. O
(I O
know O
there O
were O
Sephardic O
communities O
there O
but O
I O
don't O
know O
much O
about O
their O
religious O
trajectories.) O

This O
has O
been O
an O
invaluable O
resource O
and O
their O
newsletters O
are O
interesting. O
[SEP]
DNA O
tests O
aren't O
always O
a O
good O
indication O
of O
Jewish O
ancestry. O
For O
all O
they O
know O
they O
might O
not O
even O
be O
Ashkenazi. O
[SEP]
Thirded. O
My O
favorite O
database O
to O
use! O
[SEP]
So O
as O
I O
said, O
if O
this O
ancestor O
was O
Ashkenazi O
it's O
a O
good O
indicator. O
Ashkenazi O
DNA O
is O
distinct O
and O
easily O
identifiable. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
significant O
amount O
of O
Ashkenazi O
DNA, O
it O
will O
show O
up O
in O
your O
results. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
the O
ancestor O
was O
Sephardic O
from O
the O
Balkans, O
a O
DNA O
test O
is O
still O
a O
really O
good O
idea. O
If O
you O
look O
at O
the O
23&Me O
results O
of O
Sephardic O
Jews O
from O
the O
Balkans, O
they O
virtually O
always O
get O
somewhere O
from O
20-45% O
Ashkenazi O
in O
their O
results. O
So O
even O
if O
OP O
is O
12.5% O
Jewish O
on O
paper, O
it O
would O
very O
likely O
show O
up O
in O
the O
results. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Even O
if O
Ashkenazi O
didn't O
show O
up O
in O
the O
results O
(It O
very O
likely O
would), O
if O
you're O
Serbian O
or O
Croatian O
and O
you're O
getting O
significant O
results O
that O
include O
a O
combination O
of O
Italian, O
Broadly O
Southern O
European, O
and O
Middle O
Eastern O
and O
North O
African, O
that's O
a O
very O
strong O
indicator O
of O
Sephardic O
ancestry O
as O
well. O
The O
odds O
that O
OP O
would O
see O
either O
Ashkenazi O
and/or O
this O
combination O
of O
Southern O
European O
and O
Middle O
Eastern O
if O
they O
are O
truly O
12.5% O
Jewish O
is O
virtually O
100%. O
[SEP]
A O
fully O
Jewish O
ancestor O
(Ashkenazi O
or O
otherwise) O
in O
the O
last O
4 O
generations O
is O
more O
likely O
than O
not O
to O
show O
up O
unambiguously O
in O
a O
DNA O
test. O
But O
especially O
if O
Ashkenazi, O
it's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
very O
helpful O
for O
discovering O
details O
of O
their O
background. O
[SEP]
Fourthed. O
I'm O
a O
professional O
and O
when O
people O
ask O
me O
what O
I O
use... O
I O

by O
saying O
that O
JewishGen O

my O

[SEP]
Oh O
absolutely O
and O
also O
like O
you O
said O
it's O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
look O
at O
matches O
as O
well. O
For O
cases O
like O
this O
I'd O
recommend O
using O
Ancestry, O
this O
way O
you O
can O
build O
up O
a O
tree O
and O
with O
their O
DNA O
testing O
they O
match O
you O
to O
others O
who O
have O
also O
taken O
the O
tests O
and O
you O
can O
find O
ancestors O
you O
had O
no O
clue O
about. O
[SEP]

Okay O
but O
what O
then? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
This O
is O
the O
best O
opportunity O
for O
republicans O
to O
distance O
themselves O
from O
trump O
and O
the O
crazies, O
why O
not O
let O
them O
do O
that? O
Isn't O
that O
what O
we O
want? O
wouldn't O
that O
be O
more O
productive? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Ngl, O
your O

vindictive. O
[SEP]
Isn't O
that O
unfair. O
[SEP]

Didn't O

If O
you're O

please, O
please O
do O
this. O
Talk O
incessantly O
about O
how O
Republicans O
no O
matter O
how O
much O
they O
denounce O
a O
message O
cannot O
be O
let O
off O
the O
hook O
for O
a O
message O
they O
never O

and O
actively O
repudiated. O
Please, O

follow O

Sincerely, O
Republicans O
running O

2024 O
and O
2026. O
[SEP]
None O
of O
these O
people O
involved O
in O
this O
are O
republicans. O
Kanye, O
Fuentes, O
Milo...all O
have O
a O
history O
of O
hating O
the O
republican O
party. O
Even O
very O
conservative O
people O
like O
Matt O
Walsh O
and O
Shapiro O
wouldn't O
consider O
any O
of O
these O
people O
conservative O
or O
republican...just O
like O
Destiny O
wouldn't O
consider O
Jackson O
Hinkle O
or O
Jimmy O
Dore O
true O
leftists. O
This O
is O
a O
moronic O
post. O
Republicans B-Stance
love I-Stance
Israel I-Stance
and I-Stance
Jews I-Stance
even I-Stance
more I-Stance
then I-Stance
most I-Stance
Democrats. I-Stance
If O
anything O
a O
large O
part O
of O
the O
democratic O
party O
hates O
Zionism O
and O
is O
pretty O
outright O
anti-Semitic O
also. O
See O
Ilhan O
Omar O
and O
Rashid O
Talib. O
Also O
nobody O
"lets" O
people O
into O
parties O
homie...that O
isn't O
how O
this O
works. O
Obviously O
Shapiro O
would O
denounce O
everything O
YE O
is O
saying...hes O
Jewish. O
This O
post O
is O
just O
partisan O
hackery. O
Sorry O
bro. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
really O
important O
to O
remember O
if O
Trump O
is O
convicted O
of O
anything O
and O
can't O
run. O
They'll O
try O
to O
disassociate O
from O
him O
and O
they O
can't O
be O
allowed O
to, O
hopefully O
democrats O
will O
keep O
track O
of O
their O
asskissing O
and O
deploy O
that O
information O
well. O
[SEP]
The O
problem O
is O
that O

said O

Supporting B-Stance
Trump I-Stance
in I-Stance
2020 I-Stance
means I-Stance
supporting I-Stance
his I-Stance
baggage I-Stance
and I-Stance
horde I-Stance
of I-Stance
conspiracy I-Stance
rotted I-Stance
brained I-Stance

He O

get O

[SEP]
[SEP]
The B-Stance
only I-Stance
Republicans I-Stance
which I-Stance
get I-Stance
a I-Stance
pass I-Stance
are I-Stance
people I-Stance
like I-Stance
Romney I-Stance
and I-Stance
Liz I-Stance

who I-Stance
didn't I-Stance
buy I-Stance

[SEP]
Based. O
The B-Stance
repubs, I-Stance
even I-Stance
the I-Stance
most I-Stance
extreme I-Stance
ones, I-Stance
are I-Stance
all I-Stance
rhetoric, I-Stance
when I-Stance
it I-Stance
comes I-Stance
to I-Stance
policy I-Stance
they I-Stance
all I-Stance
voted I-Stance
to I-Stance
send I-Stance
money I-Stance
to I-Stance
Ukraine, I-Stance

are I-Stance

more I-Stance

the I-Stance

[SEP]
I O
mean O
this O
whole O
thing O
transpired O
because O
of O
Trump O
2016. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
basically O
direct O
result O
of O
what O
happens O
when O
people O
treat O
politics O
like O
sports O
teams. O
With O
sports O
you O
want O
your O
opponent O
to O
be O
shit O
so O
you O
can O
win O
easily O
but O
with O
politics O
you O
actually O
want O
both O
sides O
to O
be O
as O
strong O
as O
possible O
so O
they O
feel O
like O
the O
only O
way O
for O
them O
to O
"beat O
their O
opponent" O
is O
by O
doing O
as O
good O
of O
a O
job O
as O
possible O
to O
appeal O
the O
voters. O
If O
you O
would O
have O
either O
side O
be O
complete O
crap O
and O
irredeemable O
for O
the O
public O
for O
some O
time, O
this O
would O
only O
lead O
to O
the O
leading O
side O
taking O
as O
much O
of O
an O
advantage O
of O
the O
position O
they O
are O
in O
as O
possible- O
fuck O
the O
ordinary O
people, O
they O
will O
still O
have O
to O
vote O
for O
them O
because O
in O
their O
perception O
the O
other O
side O
is O
even O
worse O
[SEP]
Reverse O
the O
roles O
for O
a O
second O
and O
let's O
say O
they O
met O
with O
Obama O
and O
not O
Trump. O
You O
think O
Shapiro O
would O
be O
like O
"Hey O
guys O
I'm O
sure O
Obama O
wanted O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
them O
so O
we O
shouldn't O
get O
on O
the O
Dems O
about O
this." O
Yeah O
no O
fucking O
way. O
I O
don't O
see O
why O
we O
should O
be O
more O
charitable O
than O
they O
would O
be. O
[SEP]
I O
mean O
no, O
I O
would O
never O
expect O
republicans O
to O
have O
spines O
or O
morals. O
We O
should O
never O
expect O
them O
to O
denounce O
any O
craziness O
in O
their O
party. O
Atleast O
they're O
dying O
in O
greater O
numbers O
than O
democrats. O
[SEP]
TIL O
supporting O
a O
candidate O
for O
a O
political O
position O
means O
you O
support O
literally O
everything O
halfway O
adjacent O
to O
them O
[SEP]
I O
mean O
Ben O
didn’t O
like O
trump O
from O
the O
get O
go O
either O
but O
he O
voted O
for O
him O
in O
2020 O
because O
the O
Republican O
Party O
aligns O
up O
with O
his O
ideals O
more. O
I O
know O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
that O
vote O
republican O
because O
they O
agree O
with O
them O
more O
on O
issues O
even O
if O
they O
hate O
the O
candidate. O
I O
did. O
Now O
in O
retrospect, O
after O
the O
election O
denial O
stuff O
and O
janurary O
6th O
stuff O
I O
won’t O
be O
supporting O
the O
Republican O
Party O
again, O
at O
least O
for O
a O
long O
time. O
But O
I O
get O
why O
some O
people O
vote O
for O
their O
party O
even O
if O
the O
candidate O
is O
not O
good. O
[SEP]
What, O
Ye O
saying O
he O
loves O
Hitler? O
[SEP]
Well, O
shapiro O
can O
do O
w.e O
he O
wants, O
that O
doesn't O
mean O
we O
should O
follow O
what O
they're O
doing. O

should O
have O
more O

change O

To O
be O

most O

I O

Secondary O
tack O
might O
be O
to O
increase O

ask O
her O

minor O

allow O

even O
if O
in O
reality O
she O
has O
little O
choice O
in O
some O
areas, O
ask O
her O
which O
thing O
she O
might O
like O
to O
do O
first O
and O
so O
on. O

Lastly, O
I O
wish O
every O
troubled O
child O
had O
someone O
like O
you O
caring O
about O
them. O
Thank O
you O
for O
what O
you O
do. O
[SEP]
oh O
man O
thats O
like O
looking O
into O
a O
mirror O
haha. O
always O
helped O
to O
have O
teachers O
when O
they O
seemed O
like O
they O
really O
tried O
to O
make O
a O
connection O
with O
me O
and O
understand O
me O
and O
just O
be O
a O
safe O
space. O
maybe O
ask O
before O
or O
after O
class O
how O
theyre O
doin O
and O
that O
youre O
there O
for O
them O
or O
whatever. O
i O
remember O
that O
being O
a O
little O
awkward O
for O
me O
but O
its O
kinda O
nice O
to O
know O
at O
the O
same O
time O
[SEP]
I’m O
gonna O
be O
honest, O
I’m B-Health
autistic I-Health
and O
drama O
was O
something O
I O
struggled O
with O
growing O
up. O
I O
tended O
to O
use O
drama O
for O
attention O
because O
at O
school O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
thing O
that O
made O
the O
other O
girls O
care O
about O
one O
another. O
Whoever O
was O
the O
saddest O
that O
day O
had O
the O
most O
people O
surrounding O
them. O
So O
as O
an O
adult O
drama O
is O
something O
I O
struggle O
with O
because O
it’s O
hard O
for O
me O
not O
to O
see O
it O
as O
wanting O
attention. O
I O
find O
myself O
getting O
annoyed O
when O
something O
minor O
happens O
and O
she’s O
crying O
AGAIN, O
but O
I’m O
also O
trying O
really O
hard O
to O
change O
my O
viewpoint O
and O
figure O
out O
why O
the O
behavior O
is O
happening. O
[SEP]
I O
appreciate O
everyone’s O
help O
so O
far. O
[SEP]
But O
what O
is O
wrong O
with O
wanting O
attention? O
[SEP]
NAT! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
was O
kinda O
like O
this O
too O
when O
I O
was O
younger. O
I O
think O
a O
big O
part O
of O
it O
is O
that O
the O
kid O
probably O
does O
want O
attention, O
she O
just O
doesn’t O
know O
how O
to O
ask O
for O
it O
appropriately. O
I O
had O
all O
these O
feelings O
and O
things O
going O
on O
but O
I O
didn’t O
know O
how O
to O
ask O
anyone O
for O
help, O
so O
I O
did O
things O
that O
I O
thought O
might O
help O
me O
connect O
with O
people. O
Sometimes O
it O
worked O
in O
a O
way, O
but O
it’s O
hard O
to O
form O
meaningful O
connections O
when O
I O
wasn’t O
even O
fully O
aware O
I O
needed O
help. O
That O
was O
just O
my O
life. O
Hope O
that O
kinda O
makes O
sense O
:) O
[SEP]
Whenever O
we O
feel O
like O
a O
kid O
is O
out O
to O
get O
attention, O
replace O
the O
word O
attention O
with O
connection O
and O
that's O
probably O
the O
more O
true O
statement. O
[SEP]
Goes O
for O
more O
than O
just O
children! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
also, O
there's O
genuinely O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
wanting O
attention. O
It's O
a O
normal O
human O
need. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Many O
of O
us O
were O
brought O
up O
to O
feel O
like O
we O
are O
"too O
much." O
Like O
we O
want O
and O
need O
too O
much. O
We've O
taken O
a O
normal O
human O
need O
for O
attention O
and O
proclaimed O
it O
"too O
much," O
fought O
against O
it, O
then O
we O
see O
it O
in O
others O
& O
it O
brings O
up O
reactions O
in O
us. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
it's O
OK O
to O
want O
attention. O
It's O
OK O
to O
want O
comfort O
and O
soothing. O
And O
especially O
for O
children, O
they O
have O
to O
be O
taught O
how O
to O
self O
soothe O
and O
self O
comfort. O
And O
if O
nobody O
teaches O
them O
how...and O
nobody O
provides O
them O
external O
soothing O
and O
comfort... O
they O
will O
desperately O
be O
looking O
for O
it. O
Potentially O
their O
whole O
lives. O

I'm B-Age

I O

I O
want O
his O

I O
internalize O
it O
& O

it O

Hi O
there, O
so O
I'm B-Other
travelling I-Other
to I-Other
Southeast I-Other
Asia I-Other
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
the O
new O
year! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I'm O
not O
a O
fast O
paced O
kind O
of O
person O
so O
my O
original O
plan O
was O
to O
spend O
a O
few O
months O
exploring O
and O
living O
in O
Thailand, O
to O
really O
get O
a O
good O
experience O
of O
the O
place O
and O
be O
immersed O
in O
the O
culture. O
Of O
course O
I O
was O
open O
to O
visiting O
a O
couple O
of O
other O
countries O
as O
well O
whilst O
I O
am O
over O
there. O
There O
is O
a O
multiple O
entry O
tourist O
visa O
for O
Thailand O
that O
I O
can O
use O
for O
up O
to O
6 O
months, O
although O
I O
will O
have O
to O
leave O
the O
country O
after O
60 O
days O
before O
I O
can O
re-enter, O
which O
costs O
£150. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
However, O
I O
am O
also O
aware O
that O
currently O
I O
can O
spend O
45 O
days O
in O
Thailand O
on O
a O
visa O
exemption, O
and O
possibly O
another O
if O
I O
return O
(although O
I'm O
not O
100% O
sure O
on O
this). O
Considering O
this O
is O
free, O
and O
I'm O
quite O
keen O
now O
on O
visiting O
countries O
like O
Vietnam O
on O
a O
month-long O
visa, O
I O
am O
now O
undecided O
on O
whether O
its O
worth O
spending O
that O
much O
money O
for O
the O
long O
term O
Thailand O
visa O
if O
I O
can O
hop O
around O
other O
countries O
instead. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
What O
would O
people O
recommend? O
Is O
it O
worth O
getting O
the O
multiple O
entry O
visa? O
I O
know O
some O
people O
who O
go O
on O
a O
visa O
exemption O
to O
Thailand O
and O
say O
it O
isn't O
long O
enough! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
would O
also O
be O
helpful O
to O
know O
how O
many O
times O
you O
can O
get O
a O
visa O
exemption O
for O
Thailand. O

So O
I O
asked O
all O
week O
what O
he O
wanted O
to O
do O
for O
his O
birthday O
and O
he O
said O
idk O
every O
time O
I O
asked. O
Last O
year O
I O
threw O
him O
a O
party O
and O
he O
loved O
it! O
This O
year O
I O
told O
him O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
but O
he O
didn’t O
give O
me O
any O
ideas O
so O
I O
book O
a O
couple O
reservations O
so O
he O
could O
pick O
one. O
I O
even O
took O
off O
work:( O
Today O
is O
his O
birthday O
and O
he O
just O
left O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
his O
friend O
and O
said O
he O
wouldn’t O
make O
dinner O
:-/. O
I O
texted O
him O
saying O
I O
am O
a O
little O
hurt O
ur O
not O
letting O
me O
give O
u O
something O
nice O
on O
your O
birthday O
and O
he O
said O
he O
is O
just O
never O
going O
to O
tell O
me O
when O
he O
is O
going O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
friends O
because O
it O
ruins O
everything. O
And O
for O
context O
I O
was O
invited O
for O
a O
family O
thing O
they O
did O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
back O
but O
he O
had O
them O
schedule O
it O
when O
I O
was O
working. O
I O
know O
it’s O
his O
birthday O
but O
I O
am O
feeling O
a O
little O
sad O
and O
left O
out O
and O
disappointed O
I O
wasn’t O
able O
to O

he O
didn’t O

anything O

NTA: O
[SEP]
It's O
raining O
red O
flags O
babe! O
The O
streets O
are O
absolutely O
flooded O
with O
them! O
If O
he's O
already O
showing O
that O
he O
has O
little O
to O
no O
interest O
in O
spending O
time O
with O
you O
or O
any O
consideration O
for O
the O
effort O
made O
on O
your O
part O
to O
do O
something O
special O
FOR O
HIM, O
then O
what O
can O
you O
expect O
in O
return? O
When O
it's O
your O
birthday O
or O
a O
day O
worth O
celebrating? O
Do O
you O
think O
he'll O
put O
any O
effort O
into O
making O
it O
special O
for O
you? O
I'll O
wait....I O
thought O
as O
much. O
Don't O
waste O
your O

on O
someone O
who O
doesn't O

So O
I O
just O
went O
back O
and O
read O
your O
post O
from O
34 O
days O
ago O
about O
him O
not O
sticking O
up O
for O
you. O
I O
saw O
your O
edit O
that O
he O
added O
that O
girl O
back O
on O
snap O
and O
tried O
to O
hide O
it O
from O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Do O
you O
not O
see O
these O
huge O
red O
flags?? O
If O
you O
want O
to O
know O
how O
he O
spent O
his O
birthday, O
probably O
want O
to O
check O
out O
her O
snapchat O
or O
IG…. O
[SEP]
He O
sounds O
like O
an O
idiot, O
he's O
never O
going O
warn O
you O
when O
he O
want O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
his O
friends? O
What? O
[SEP]
I O
had O
a O
boyfriend O
like O
yours. O
My O
friends O
said O
that O
I O
was O
going O
out O
with O
him, O
but O
he O
wasn't O
going O
out O
with O
me. O
Are O
you O
sure O
he's O
your O
boyfriend O
or O
are O
you O
just O
his O
FWB? O
[SEP]
NTA....if O
he O
acts O
like O
this O
in O
the O
"still O
not O
married, O
I O
better O
act O
decent" O
phase..it O
will O
get O
much O
worse O
once O
you O
are O
married. O
You O
may O
want O
to O
take O
a O
hard O
look O
at O
what O
you O
want...and O
consider O
if O
he O
is O
willing O
to O
make O
any O
effort O
for O
you.... O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
many O
friends O
who O
have O
wasted O

decade O
plus O
only O
to O
finally O
get O
dumped O
when O
the O
trash O
significant O
other/fiance O
moves O
on O
(cheats) O
with O
whomever O
they O
feel O
is O
more O
important. O
[SEP]
NTA. O
This O
is O
not O
going O
to O
be O
what O
you O
want O
to O
hear O
but O
this O
comes O
across O
like O
he O
doesn’t O
want O
you O
to O
be O
an O
active O
part O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life, O
and O
potentially O
could O
be O
cheating. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Deliberately O
excluding O
you O
from O
his O
family O
is O
a O
major, O
major O
red O
flag O
(assuming O
he O
was O
actually O
with O
his O
family). O
By O
getting O
married O
you O
would O
be O
his O
family O
so O
this O
is O
really O
odd. O

The O
attitude O

‘I O
don’t O
need O
to O
tell O
you O
were O
I’m O
going O
or O
when O
I’m O
doing O
things’ O
is O
an O
attitude O
someone O
has O
to O
something O
they’re O
casually O
seeing, O
not O
their O
fiancé. O
Again, O
major, O
major O
red O
flag O
(again, O
assuming O
he O
was O
actually O
with O
his O
friends). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
other O
issue O
is O
NOT O
that O
he O
wouldn’t O
let O
you O
do O
something O
nice O
for O
him, O
it’s O
that O
you O
made O
plans O
that O
he O
knew O
about O
in O
advance O
and O
he O
didn’t O
show O
up. O
If O
he O
does O
that O
for O
HIS O
birthday, O
he’s O
going O
to O
do O
it O
on O
other O
occasions O
that O
don’t O
revolve O
around O
him. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
really O
surprised O
that O
someone O
would O
propose O
to O
a O
partner O
then O
treat O
them O
like O
this O
to O
be O
honest. O
It O
sounds O
like O
either O
he’s O
pushing O
you O
out O
and O
a O
break O
up O
may O
be O
coming, O
or O
he’s O
cheating. O
[SEP]
NTA O
you O
were O
invited O
but O
he O
purposely O
had O
them O
schedule O
it O
when O
you O
couldn’t O
be O
there? O
sweetie, O
you O
fiancé O
doesn’t O
like O
you O
very O
much O
[SEP]
Nta O
and O
honestly O
it O
kinda O
sounds O

he’s O
cheating O
on O
you O
and O
giving O
a O
bad O
excuse O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
he O
doesn't O
even O
like O
you O
tbh. O
Take O
a O
look O

your O
relationship. O
This O
behavior O
is O
not O
normal O

couples. O
[SEP]
NTA, O
get O

that O
dude O
wants O

get O
rid O

you O
[SEP]
NTAH. O
He's O
being O
a O
jerk. O
If O
he O
wanted O
to O
spend O
time O
with O
his O
friends, O
fine O
but O
he O
needed O
to O
communicate O

you O

you O
made O
it O
clear O
by O
repeatedly O
asking O
him O
what O
he O
wanted O
to O
do O
on O
his O
birthday O
that O
you O
wanted O
to O
spend O
time O
with O
him, O
so O
not O
discussing O
this O
with O
you O
is O
rude O
af. O

That, O
combined O
with O
the O

man O
loves O
you? O

for O
how O
you O
feel, O
but O
YWBTA O
to O
yourself O
if O
you O
keep O

him. O
He O
made O
it O

you O

He O
is O
purposefully O
making O

Ok O
I'm O
not O
sure O
I'm O

this O
right. O
You O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
you O
kept O
asking O
him O
what O
to O
do. O
His O
answer O
was O
always O
"I O
don't O
know". O
So O
you O
made O
restaurant O
reservations. O
Did O
he O
know O
you O
made O
those O
reservations? O
Not O
mind O
reading O
or O
the O
hints O
were O
obvious, O
but O
you O
said O
"I O
made O

for O
your O

dinner O
at O

birthday, O
sound O
good?". O

If O
you O
told O
him O

about O

then O
he's O

If O
you O
just O
assumed O

finally O
came O
up O

then O
you're O
in O

Definitely O
NTA O
and O
i O
would O
be O
incredibly O
hurt O

Yeah O
it’s O
his O
birthday O
but O
you O
talked O
to O
him O
and O
tried O
to O
plan O
something O
for O
him O
and O
he O
completely O
blew O
you O
off O
like O
you O
don’t O

He’s O
very O
inconsiderate O

even O
a O
little O
selfish O

rude. O
He O
he O
like O
that O
in O
other O
aspects O
of O
your O

[SEP]
I O
mean O
it’s O
not O
cool O

okay O
what O
he O
did, O
he’s O

He’s O
clearly O

he O
doesn’t O
fancy O
your O
company O
much, O
or O
want O
you O
to O
be O
around O
his O

It’s O

Besides O

You O

He O

such O
ass O
never O
going O

my O

as O
well. O
OP O
he O

wise O

I’m O
wondering O
if O
there O
was O
a O
proposal O
at O
all O
or O
if O
this O
is O
just O
a O
title O
that O
was O
given O
to O
him. O
Because O
he O
sounds O
like O
a O
FWB, O
not O
a O

Even O
if O
he O
didn’t O
know O
there O
were O
firm O
plans, O
he O
did O
know O
she O
was O
wanting O
to O
plan O
something. O
So O
he’s O
still O
the O
AH O
because O
then O
he O
supposedly O
made O
plans O
but O
didn’t O
include O
her. O
[SEP]
He O
definitely O
knew O
because O
he O
wanted O

try O
this O

It O
basically O
because O
there O

Your O
relationships O
must O
suck O
[SEP]
The O
behaviour O
definitely O
screams O
FWB O
but O
if O
they O
aren’t O
actually O
engaged O
and O
OP O
just O
calls O
refers O
to O
him O
as O
her O
fiancé, O
that O
would O
be O
really O
odd O
on O
OP’s O
part O
[SEP]
She's O
said O
he O
definitely O
knew, O
so O
it's O
not O
really O
relevant. O
But O
I O
enjoy O
discussing O
possibilities O
and O
assume O
you O
do O
as O
well O
since O
you O
responded O
after O
she O
clarified. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
she O
never O
made O
it O
clear O
what O
the O
plans O
were O
then O
he's O
not O
wrong O
for O
thinking O
there O
aren't O
any. O
Not O
everyone O
celebrates O
their O
birthday O
on O
their O
actual O
birthday. O
Perhaps O
he O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
weekend O
thing. O
Or O
perhaps O
he O
thought O
she O
would O
do O
something O
but O
then O
she O
was O
home O
and O
nothing, O
nothing, O
nothing O
so O
when O
his O
friends O
invited O
him O
to O
something O
he O
frustratedly O
picked O
something O
over O
nothing. O
He's O
not O
a O
mind-reader O
and O
shouldn't O
be O
blamed O
for O
her O
lack O
of O
communication. O
It's O
his O
birthday, O
he O
can O
spend O
it O
how O
he O
wants. O
He O
didn't O
break O
plans O
with O
her O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
his O
friends O
because O
he O
didn't O
know O
there O
were O
plans. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
often O
do O
we O
see O
people O
here O
with O
his O
story? O
"I O
always O
do O
a O
ton O
for O
his O
birthday O
and O
this O
year O
I'm O
sitting O
home O
waiting O
for O
anything O
to O
happen. O
He O
even O
has O
the O
day O
off O
of O
work, O
but O
so O
far O
all O
he's O
done O
is O
watch O
a O
movie O
by O
himself. O
My O
friends O
invited O
me O
to O
go O
out O
but O
I O
said O
no O
because O
I'm O
sure O
he'll O
do O
something. O
Well O
reddit, O
he O
didn't. O
We O
got O
in O
a O
big O
fight O
at O
bedtime O
and O
he O
says O
I'm O
TA O
for O
blaming O
him O
that O
I O
didn't O
go O
with O
my O
friends. O
He O
never O
said O
we O
had O
plans O
so O
it's O
my O
fault O
for O
assuming. O
He O
says O
he O
had O
reservations O
at O
a O
hotel O
for O
us O
for O
this O
weekend O
but O
now O
he's O
cancelling O
because O
he's O
mad O
at O
me." O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
there's O
no O
communication O
then O
that's O
the O
problem. O
He's O
not O
at O
fault O
for O
her O
lack O
of O
communication. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Again, O
all O
hypothetical O
as O
she's O
stated O
that O
he O
did O
know. O
[SEP]
I’m O
sorry O
but O
if B-Husband_BF
my I-Husband_BF
husband I-Husband_BF
ignores I-Husband_BF
it I-Husband_BF
my O
birthday O
was O
coming O
up O
and O
didn’t O
even O
acknowledge O
it O
and O
then O
expected O
me O
to O
be O
free O
and O
not O
make O
plans, O
I’d O
be O
perfectly O
in O
the O
right O
to O
do O
that. O
When O
you O
plan O
to O
surprise O
someone O
you O
have O
to O
actually O
make O
sure O
they’re O
available. O
So O
it’s O
actually O
very O
important O
to O
know O
if O
she O
asked O
or O
told O
him O
that O
she O
made O
plans O
for O
him. O
[SEP]
On O
the O
contrary... O
[SEP]
I O
totally O
agree. O
However O
I O
have O
read O
stories O
about O
people O
somehow O
assuming O
they’re O
engaged O
when O
they’re O
really O
not. O
[SEP]
I O
completely O
see O
your O
point O
and O
don’t O
necessarily O
disagree O
with O
that O
possibility. O
However, O
I O
did O
read O
another O
post O
by O
her O
from O
a O
little O
over O
a O
month O
ago. O
I O
think O
that O
they O
are O
not O
on O
the O
same O
page O
in O
terms O
of O
where O
they O
are O
in O
their O
relationship. O
I O
think O
she O
views O
their O
relationship O
as O
more O
serious O
than O
he O
does. O
[SEP]
I O
agree O
she O
should O
have O
told O
him O
and O
it’s O
not O
clear O
if O
OP O
told O
him O
but O
still O
he O
should O
have O
at O
least O
asked O
or O
known O
that O
she O
would O
plan O
something O
[SEP]
Plus O
with O
the O
additional O
information O
of O
hun O
planning O
stuff O
without O
her O
[SEP]
In O
this O
context O
he’s O
AH O
[SEP]
You're O
better O
than O
me, O
I O
rarely O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
user O

and O
have O
no O
idea O
when O
they O
posted O
something O
else. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
agree, O
they O
don't O
seem O
like O
they're O
on O
the O
same O
page. O
Honestly O
I O
think O
that's O
usually O
the O
case O
with O
most O

World O
Cup O
voting O
issue O
[SEP]
So, O
the O
thing O
is O
that O
I’m B-Race_Nationality
Swiss I-Race_Nationality
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
vote O
for O
Switzerland, O
but: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
First O
time O
I O
missed O
it O
bc O
lack O
of O
communication O
on O
CoD O
(didn’t O
know O
you O
could O
vote O
for O
your O
country O
in O
game) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Second O
time O
I O
think O
I O
was O
too O
late O
for O
the O
vote O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
now O
I O
tried O
to O
vote O
when O
I O
came O
back O
from O
work O
(7pm O
UTC+1) O
but O
I O
only O
had O
the O
option O
to O
vote O
for O
Brazil. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Can O
I O
even O
vote O
for O
Switzerland O
or O
is O
this O
another O
bug O
on O
the O
bug O
list O
this O
game O
has O
? O
[SEP]
They O
chose O
six O
matches O
for O
the O
contest O
- O
tomorrow’s O
match O
is O
Brazil O
v. O
Cameroon. O
If O
you O
missed O
your O
chance O
earlier O
then O
it’s O
too O
late. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Edit: O
AFAIK, O
Switzerland O
was O
never O
even O
a O
part O
of O
the O
contest. O
[SEP]
There O
is O
no O
bug, O
COD O
selected O
6 O
matches O
to O
include O
in O
this O
promotion, O
Switzerland O
was O
never O
one O
of O
them. O
[SEP]
So O
no O
Swiss O
calling O
card O
or O
anything O
? O
[SEP]
Not O
yet O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know. O
I’m O
sure O
they O
could O
add O
it O
in O
the O
future, O
but O
there O
were O
only O
12 O
countries O
in O
total O
for O
this O
little O
betting O
game. O
And O
only O
the O
winners O
get O
their O
cards/anthems O
distributed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
England/US O
(since O
it O
was O
a O
draw), O
Argentina, O
Spain/Germany O
(another O
draw), O
Ghana, O
Tunisia, O
and O
the O
winner O
of O
Brazil/Cameroon O
tomorrow. O
[SEP]
Wonder O
how O
many O
people O
will O
get O
the O
4 O
matches O
bonus O
reward. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
2 O
are O
a O
given O
(draws) O
and O
probably O
Argentina O
winning O
was O
likely, O
but O
Mexico O
weren't O
actually O
that O
low O
in O
the O
rankings. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
However O
I O
didn't O
see O
Ghana O
and O
Tunisia O
winning. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
way O
things O
have O
gone O
there O
might O
only O
be O
a O

getting O
it. O
[SEP]
Okay O

your O

[SEP]
I’ve O
already O
got O

I O

Being O

living O
that O

then O

one. O

Ever O
since O
I O
was O
a O
kid O
(I'm B-Age
37), I-Age
I O
felt O
this O
sort O

restlessness. O
Everyone O
around O
me O
always O
told O
me O
to O
get O
a O
job, O
marry, O
settle O
down. O
My O
first O
marriage O
was O
a O
complete O
fuck O
up O
(through O
my O
own O
actions) O
and O
my O
life O
was O
falling O
a O
part. O
Then, O
something O
within O
me O
sort O
of, O
snapped O
into O
place. O
Fast O
forward O
a O
few O
years O
and O
I'm O
just O
overall, O
happy. O
Sure, O
I O
fuck O
up O
here O
and O
there O
(again, O
self O
doing) O
but O
I O
think O
that's O
to O
remind O
me O
that O
I'm O
human O
. O
As O
long O
you O
keep O
it O
moving O
and O
DOING O
SOMETHING O
to O
better O
yourself O
as O

Stick O
with O
the O
401k O
and O
max O
out O
your O

benefit. O
If O
your O
itching O
to O
try O
investing O
just O
start O
a O
Webull O
account O
with O
funds O
after O
you’ve O
maxed O
out O
your O

benefits. O
Start O
small O
to O
learn O
the O
ropes O
and O
grow O
as O
you O
feel O
comfortable. O
But O
not O
using O
your O

literally O

That's O

went O
down O

Some O
questions: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
- O
Are O
you O
investing O
in O
a O
traditional O
401k? O
And O
what O
approx O
is O
your O
yearly O
income? O
Because O
high O
income O
people O
should O
invest O
in O
their O
traditional O
401k O
first O
and O
foremost, O
because O
of O
the O
tax O
savings. O
[SEP]
[SEP]

[SEP]
[SEP]

Are O

[SEP]
[SEP]
- O
What O
exactly O
would O
you O

in O
if O
you O
invested O
on O
your O
own? O
Individual O
stocks? O
Index O
funds? O
You're O
new O

so O
why O
do O
you O
think O
you O
should O
go O
it O
alone?? O
[SEP]

[SEP]
Good O
point. O
I O
would O
probably O
do O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
everything, O
individual O
stocks, O
dividends, O
and O
index O
funds. O
Yes, O
you O
are O
right, O
probably O
not O
the O
best O
idea. O
[SEP]
My O
pleasure. O
Good O
luck! O
[SEP]
Stick O
with O
the O
401k. O
You O
get O
a O
great O
tax O
advantage O
and O
possibly O
a O
company O
match. O
These O
will O
put O
you O
far O
ahead O
of O
trying O
to O
invest O
alone O
in O
a O
non O
tax O
advantaged O
account. O
And O
you'll O
likely O
take O
a O
lot O
more O
risk, O
meaning O
you O
are O
likely O
to O
lose O
a O
lot O
more O
money. O
[SEP]
Just O
federal O
taxes, O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
in O
the O
22% O
tax O
bracket O
with O
your O
income. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
6% O
of O
$72,500 O
is O
$4,350. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
When O
you O
invest O
$4,350 O
into O
your O
traditional O
401k, O
that O
money O
isn't O
taxed O
-- O
which O
means O
that O
had O
you O
not O
contributed O
that O
money O
into O
your O
401k, O
it O
would O
be O
coming O
to O
you O
in O
your O
paycheck... O
but O
you'd O
only O
get O
$3,393 O
of O
it O
(because O
22% O
of O
that O
$4,350 O
would O
have O
gone O
to O
the O
IRS). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Then O
let's O
say O
that O
your O
employer O
offers O
50% O
match O
on O
your O
6% O
contribution. O
That's O
$2,175. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Contribution O
into O
your O
401k: O
$6,525 O
a O
year. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
While O
to O
invest O
on O
your O
own, O
outside O
the O
401k, O
at O
the O
same O
financial O
hit: O
$3,393 O
a O
year. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
really O
want O
to O
invest O
on O
your O
own, O
just O
make O
sure O
you O
get O
the O
full O
6% O
match O
on O
your O
employer's O
401k, O
and O
then O
invest O
inside O
a O
Roth O
IRA O
with O
spare O
cash. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
Roth O
IRA O
is O
just O
a O
tax-advantaged O
investment O
vehicle, O
and O
you O
can O
invest O
in O
individual O
stocks, O
dividend O
stocks, O
index O
funds O
etc. O
inside O
of O
it. O
[SEP]
Thanks O
so O
much O
for O
your O
insight. O

helps O
me O
a O

Some O
back O
story: O
my O
sister O
(26F) B-Age_Gender
and O
I O
(28F) B-Age_Gender
grew B-Personal_Experiences
up I-Personal_Experiences
in I-Personal_Experiences
an I-Personal_Experiences
abusive I-Personal_Experiences
household. I-Personal_Experiences
We O
lost O
contact O
with O
eachother O
for O
almost O
8 O
years. O
We O
reconnected O
almost O
2 O
years O
ago O
and O
decided O
to O
move O
in O
together. O
During B-Time
that I-Time
8 I-Time
years I-Time
I B-Pet
adopted I-Pet
a I-Pet
pitbull I-Pet
from O
an O
abusive O
and O
neglective O
environment. O
She O
came O
with O
me O
when O
I O
moved O
in O
with O
my O
sister. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
we O
both O
work O
full O
time O
and O
more O
often O
than O
not O
my O
sister O
is O
home O
hours O
before O
I O
am. O
When O
I O
leave O
for O
work O
I B-Pet
put I-Pet
my I-Pet
dog I-Pet
into I-Pet
a I-Pet
crate I-Pet
(something O
I O
hate O
doing O
but O
if O
I O
don't O
she O
likes O
to O
get O
into O
the O
garbage O
out O
of O
boredom). O
The O
only O
thing O
I O
ask O
of O
her O
is O
when O
she O
is O
done O
with O
her O
30 O
minute O
break O
(We O
have O
a O
household O
policy O
that O
when O
you O
get O
home O
you O
take O
30 O
minutes O
to O
yourself O
and O
relax) O
then O
take O
the O
dog O
out O
so O
she O
can O
do O
her O
business. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
the O
last O
year, O
year O
and O
half O
roughly, O
my O
sister O
has O
gotten O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
getting O
home O
and O
getting O
on O
a O
game O
or O
falling O
asleep O
before O
taking O
her O
out. O
So O
when O
I O
get O
home O
the O
dog O
is O
still O
in O
her O
crate O
and O
there O
would O
be O
pee O
and O
poop O
in O
it O
and O
I'd O
have O
to O
clean O
it O
up. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Last O
night O
was O
one O
of O
those O
nights O
and O
the O
dog O
hasn't O
been O
feeling O
well. O
So O
her O
poop O
is...liquid. O
There O
was O
poop O
EVERYWHERE O
in O
the O
crate O
and O
on O
the O
dog. O
I O
lost O
it. O
I O
busted O
my O
way O
into O
her O
room O
(thinking O
she O
fell O
asleep O
again O
so O
thinking O
I'd O
have O
to O
make O
as O
much O
noise O
as O
possible O
to O
wake O
her O
up). O
All O
I O
asked O
was O
if O
the O
dog O
has O
been O
out O
yet. O
Granted O
in O
a O
yelling O
tone. O
She O
took O
the O
dog O
out O
and O
when O
she O
came O
back O
in O
I O
asked O
her O
what O
her O
issue O
is. O
I O
don't O
ask O
her O
for O
rent, O
though O
she O
pays O
half O
anyways. O
I O
don't O
ask O
her O
to O
help O
clean, O
she O
barely O
does O
that. O
All O
I O
ask O
is O
for O
her O
to O
take O
the O
dog O
out. O
She O
just O
kept O
apologizing O
and O
said O
she O
lost O
track O
of O
time O
from O
being O
on O
her O
game. O
I'm O
a O
gamer O
as O
well O
but O
if O
I O
know O
something O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
I O
do O
that O
first O
then O
get O
online. O
I O
told O
her O
that O
if O
she O
can't O
do O
that O
then O
she O
is O
gonna O
have O
to O
have O
to O
find O
somewhere O
else O
to O
stay. O
Or O
I O
leave. O
She O
got O
mad O
at O
me O
calling O
me O
an O
asshole O
because O
she O
can't O
afford O
to O
live O
on O
her O
own. O
And O
that O
she O
knows O
she O
messed O
up O
but O
I O
don't O
need O
to O
take O
it O
that O
far. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
AITA?? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Edit: O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
some O
confusion O
about O
if O
I'm O
the O
landlord. O
I O
am O
not. O
I O
am O
a O
tenant O
as O
much O
as O
my O

is. O
I O
paid O
for O
the O
deposit O
but O
that's O
a O
mute O
point. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Edit O
2: O
if O
my O
sister O
walks O
the O
dog O
when O
she O
gets O
home O
the O
dog O
is O
in O
there O
for O
4 O
or O
5 O
hours O
at O
the O
most. O
If O
I O
walk O
her O
when O
I O
get O
home O
and O
she O
has O
been O
in O
the O
cage O
when O
I O
get O
home O
it's O
going O
on O
9 O
hours O
at O
most. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Edit O
3: O
at O
this O
time O
dog O
sitters O
are O
a O
no O
go O
for O
me. O
I O
have O
hired O
people O
3 O
times O
and O
all O
3 O
times O
it O
was O
a O
bad O
experience. O
For B-Pet
both I-Pet
my I-Pet
dog, I-Pet
me, O
and O
the O
personal O
belongings. O
I O
am O
prepared O
to O
rehome O
her O
if O
I O
really O
must. O

4: O
I O
get O
it, O
ITA O

a O
dog O
while O
working O
40 O
hours. O
Other O
than O
telling O
me O
I O
need O
to O
rehome O
her O
how O
about O
some O
suggestions O
on O
how O
to O
fix O
boredom. O
I O
did O
not O
go O
into O
her O
background O
because O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
it O
necessary O
to O
the O
original O
post. O
She O
was O
almost O
3 O
years O
old O
when O
I O
took O
her O
in. O
She O
was O
not O
house O
trained O
whatsoever. O
Had O
no O
obedience O
training. O
Was O
not O
fixed O
nor O
had O
ever O
had O
shots O
since O
she O
was O
still O
a O
puppy. O
She O
had O
bite O
marks O
and O
still O
has O
scars O
from O
other O
dogs O
all O
over O
her. O
Especially O
on O
her O
neck O
and O
right O
hind O
leg. O
She O
is O
terrified O
of O
small O
dogs O
and O
hates O
big O
dogs. O
I O
got O
her O
trained, O
fixed, O
updated O
shots, O
and O
mostly O
house O
trained O
while O
still O
working O
40 O
hour O
work O
weeks. O
The O
only O
huge O
issue O
I'm O
facing O
right O
now O
is O
her O
boredom O
or O
maybe O
it's O
anxiety. O
Idk. O
She O
gets O
into O
EVERYTHING O
if O
left O
to O
her O
own O
devices. O
At O
one O
point O
in O
particular O
I O
rushed O
her O
to O
a O
vet O
hospital O
because O
she O
thought O
cleaning O
chemicals O
were O
something O
to O
snack O
on. O
I O
learned O
my O
lesson O
on O
that O
one. O
I O
have O
to O
put O
her O
in O
the O
crate O
for O
her O
own O
safety O
at O
this O
point. O
As O
long O
as O
she O
gets O
walked O
every O
5/6 O
hours O
maximum O
then O
there's O
no O
mess O
of O
any O
kind. O
No O
poop, O
pee, O
trash, O
cushions, O
pieces O
of O
wall O
anywhere. O

and O
I O
feel O
bad O
for O
your O
dog. O
Please O
rehome O
them O
to O
someone O
who O
has O
the O
time O
and O
ability O
to O
take O
care O
of O
them O
properly. O
A O
dog O
shouldn’t O
be O
in O
a O
crate O
for O
that O
long(I O
personally O
never O
used O
crates O
except O
for O
transporting) O
it’s O
cruel O
to O
have O
your O
dog O
live O
that O
way. O
It’s O
your O
fault O
your O
dog O
has O
to O
use O
the O
bathroom O
inside O
because O
it’s O
so O
neglected, O
your O
sister O
obviously O
isn’t O
interested O
in O
helping O
out O
with O
the O
dog. O
So O
sad O
that O
no O
one O
is O
doing O
right O
by O
this O
innocent O
animal. O
[SEP]
Does O
she O
live O
at O
yours O
rent O
free O
and O
part O
of O
the O
agreement O
is O
you O
look O
after O
your O
dog? O
It O
also O
sounds O
like O
the O
dog O
isn't O
hers O
it's O
yours. O
I'm O
kind O
of O
on O
the O
fence. O
If O
I O
was O
her O
out O
of O
my O
nature O
I'd O
look O
after O
the O
dog. O
But O
if O
it's O
not O
her O
responsibility, O
as O
hard O
as O
it O
is O
of O
a O
pill O
to O
swallow O
she O
doesn't O
owe O
you O
taking O
care O
of O
the O
dog. O
[SEP]
I'd O
say O
have O
an O
open O
conversation O
and O
air O
it O
out. O

Some O
back O
story: O
my O
sister O
(26F) B-Age_Gender
and O
I O
(28F) B-Age_Gender
grew O
up O
in O
an O
abusive O
household. O
We O
lost O
contact O
with O
eachother O
for O
almost O
8 O
years. O
We O
reconnected O
almost O
2 O
years O
ago O
and O
decided O
to O
move O
in O
together. O
During B-Time
that I-Time
8 I-Time
years I-Time
I B-Pet
adopted I-Pet
a I-Pet
pitbull I-Pet
from O
an O
abusive O
and O
negative O
environment. O
She O
came O
with O
me O
when O
I O
moved O
in O
with O
my O
sister. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
we O
both O
work O
full O
time O
and O
more O
often O
than O
not O
my O
sister O
is O
home O
hours O
before O
I O
am. O
When O
I O
leave O
for O
work O
I B-Pet
put I-Pet
my I-Pet
dog I-Pet
into I-Pet
a I-Pet
crate I-Pet
(something O
I O
hate O
doing O
but O
if O
I O
don't O
she O
likes O
to O
get O
into O
the O
garbage O
out O
of O
boredom). O
The O
only O
thing O
I O
ask O
of O
her O
is O
when O
she O
is O
done O
with O
her O
30 O
minute O
break O
(We O
have O
a O
household O
policy O
that O
when O
you O
get O
home O
you O
take O
30 O
minutes O
to O
yourself O
and O
relax) O
then O
take O
the O
dog O
out O
so O
she O
can O
do O
her O
business. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
the O
last O
year, O
year O
and O
half O
roughly, O
my O
sister O
has O
gotten O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
getting O
home O
and O
getting O
on O
a O
game O
or O
falling O
asleep O
before O
taking O
her O
out. O
So O
when O
I O
get O
home O
the O
dog O
is O
still O
in O
her O
crate O
and O
there O
would O
be O
pee O
and O
poop O
in O
it O
and O
I'd O
have O
to O
clean O
it O
up. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Last O
night O
was O
one O
of O
those O
nights O
and O
the O
dog O
hasn't O
been O
feeling O
well. O
So O
her O
poop O
is...liquid. O
There O
was O
poop O
EVERYWHERE O
in O
the O
crate O
and O
on O
the O
dog. O
I O
lost O
it. O
I O
busted O
my O
way O
into O
her O
room O
(thinking O
she O
fell O
asleep O
again O
so O
thinking O
I'd O
have O
to O
make O
as O
much O
noise O
as O
possible O
to O
wake O
her O
up). O
All O
I O
asked O
was O
if O
the O
dog O
has O
been O
out O
yet. O
Granted O
in O
a O
yelling O
tone. O
She O
took O
the O
dog O
out O
and O
when O
she O
came O
back O
in O
I O
asked O
her O
what O
her O
issue O
is. O
I O
don't O
ask O
her O
for O
rent, O
though O
she O
pays O
half O
anyways. O
I O
don't O
ask O
her O
to O
help O
clean, O
she O
barely O
does O
that. O
All O
I O
ask O
is O
for O
her O
to O
take O
the O
dog O
out. O
She O
just O
kept O
apologizing O
and O
said O
she O
lost O
track O
of O
time O
from O
being O
on O
her O
game. O
I'm O
a O
gamer O
as O
well O
but O
if O
I O
know O
something O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
I O
do O
that O
first O
then O
get O
online. O
I O
told O
her O
that O
if O
she O
can't O
do O
that O
then O
she O
is O
gonna O
have O
to O
have O
to O
find O
somewhere O
else O
to O
stay. O
Or O
I O
leave. O
She O
got O
mad O
at O
me O
calling O
me O
an O
asshole O
because O
she O
can't O
afford O
to O
live O
on O
her O
own. O
And O
that O
she O
knows O
she O
messed O
up O
but O
I O
don't O
need O
to O
take O
it O
that O
far. O

You O

this O

[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
your O
input. O
The O
most O
she O
is O
in O
the O
crate O
is O
(if O
my O
sister O
walks O
her O
when O
she O
gets O
home) O
4 O
or O
5 O
hours. O
If O
she O
is O
still O
there O
when O
I O
get O
home O
it's O
9 O
hours O
roughly. O
I O
hate O
both. O
I O
do O
NOT O
want O
to O
have O
her O
in O
the O
cage. O
But O
at O
this O
time O
it's O
the O
only O
option. O
I O
have O
tried O
training O
her O
to O
be O
"house O
trained" O
in O
a O
way. O
And O
we O
got O
to O
a O
place O
where O
I O
could O
leave O
her O
for O
an O
hour O
alone. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also O
I'm O
not O
a O
landlord. O
I'm O
a O
tenant O
as O
well. O
My B-Family
sister I-Family
snd I-Family
I I-Family
live I-Family
together I-Family
as I-Family
tenants. I-Family
Then O
we O
pay O
the O
landlord. O
I O
paid O
for O
the O
2.6k$ O
for O
the O
deposit. O
And O
at O
this O
point O
I O
have O
serious O
doubts O
I'm O
getting O
it O
back. O
This O
place O
is O
too O
small O
for O
the O
dog O
but O
it O
was O
the O
only O
place O
that O
had O
no O
dog O
restrictions. O
I O
just O
have O
to O
pay O
a O
"pet O
fee" O
every O
month O
and O
have O
liability O
insurance O
and O
show O
she O
is O
fixed O
and O
is O
updated O
on O
her O
shots. O
I'm O
waiting O
on O
a O
promotion O
from O
my O
work O
in O
4 O
months O
to O
be O
able O
to O
afford O
a O
home O
loan O
so O
I O
give O
this O
dog O
at O
least O
a O
yard O
to O
run O
around O
in. O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
give O
up O
something O
that O
has O
been O
with O
me O
since O
my O
lowest O
in O
my O
life. O
But O
I O
am O
prepared O
to O
if O
this O
promotion O
doesn't O
come O
to O
fruition. O
[SEP]
I O
was O
just O
thinking O
this O
- O
my B-Pet
dogs I-Pet
go I-Pet
out I-Pet
as O
soon O
as O
I've O
set O
my O
bag O
down. O
It O
must O
be O
awful O
for O
that O
pup O
knowing O
someone O
is O
home O
but O
ignoring O
them. O
[SEP]

ESH O
[SEP]
Came O
here O

that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
care O
for O
your O
animals, O
then O
you O
get O
to O
rest. O
[SEP]
I O
do O
walk O
the O
dog O
as O
soon O
as O
I'm O
in O
the O
door. O
The O
dog O
isn't O
really O
her O
responsibility O
but O
I O
understand O
where O
you're O
coming O
from O
as O
well. O
And O
I O
do O
agree O
with O
you O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
your O
input O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
your O
input. O
And O
I O
have O
looked O
into O
dog O
walkers O
and O
sitters. O
And O
I O
have O
had O
REALLY O
bad O
experiences O
with O
dog O
sitters. O
All O
3 O
times O
I've O
hired O
someone O
I O
either O
got O
scammed, O
stolen O
from, O
or O
had O
my O
place O
be O
the O
local O
party O
house O
for O
a O
night. O
And O
I O
have O
been O
thinking O
seriously O
to O
just O
rehome O
her. O
But O
until O
then O
the O
dog O
is O
still O
here. O
And O
no O
she O
isn't O
in O
the O
crate O
all O
night. O
My O
schedule O
runs O
from O
10am-7/8pm. O
I O
walk O
her O
before O
I O
leave O
for O
work, O
when O
I O
get O
home, O
about O
an O
hour O
after O
she O
eats, O
then O
one O
more O
time O
before O
I O
pass O
out O
for O
the O
night. O
1 O
or O
2am. O
[SEP]
So O
what O
you're O
saying O
is O
people O
who O
work O
cannot O
have O
animals? O
Just O
wanna O
make O
sure O
I O
understand O
you O
correctly. O
Because O
by O
your O
way O
of O
wording O
anyone O
who O
works O
more O
than O
15-20 O
hours O
a O
week O
should O
not O
have O
pets. O
Or O
children O
for O
that O
matter. O
How O
do O
YOU O
suggest O
I B-Pet
help I-Pet
my I-Pet
dog I-Pet
from I-Pet
getting I-Pet
bored I-Pet
and I-Pet
ripping I-Pet
the I-Pet
whole I-Pet
house I-Pet
apart..AGAIN? I-Pet
I O
have O
tried O
everything O
from O
a O
specialist O
dog O
trainer O
to O
gross O
tasting O
sprays O
that O
"makes O
puppies O
uninterested O
in O
chewing O
things", O
to O
simply O
taking O
a O
trash O
out O
before O
I O
leave. O
This O
adorable O
dumbo O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
get O
into O
the O
cabinet O
where O
I O
kept O
(not O
anymore) O
cleaning O
chemicals. O
She O
almost O
died! O
I O
got O
home O
just O
in O
time O
and O
rushed O
her O
to O
the O
vet O
hospital O
and O
had O
her O
stomach O
pumped! O
She O
stayed O
there O
for O
almost O
a O
week O
for O
observation O
it O
was O
so O
bad. O
YOU O
may O
never O
had O
to O
use O
crates O
but O
I'm O
not O
you. O
And O
nor O
was O
I O
lucky O
enough O
to O
find O
this O
fur O
brain O
when O
she O
was O
still O
a O
puppy. O
I O
got O
her O
when O
she O
was O
almost O
3 O
years O
old O
and O
she O
wasn't O
house O
trained! O
*I* O
got O
her O
to O
be O
house O
trained. O
Or O
are O
least O
to O
a O
point O
where O
she O
can O
hold O
it O
longer O
than O
she O
originally O
could. O
As O
long O
as O
she O
gets O
walked O
every O
5/6 O
hours O
everything O
is O
fine. O
[SEP]
It O
was O
the O
original O
agreement O
that O
she O
wouldn't O
have O
to O
pay O
rent O
if O
she O
walks O
the O
dog O
a O
few O
times O
during O
the O
day. O
She O
decided O
on O
her O
own O
to O
pay O
half O
the O
rent O
when O
she O
got O
a O
pay O
raise. O
So O
she O
sends O
me O
money O
through O
zelle. O
But O
she O
said O
she'd O
still O
walk O
the O
dog O
when O
she O
gets O
home. O
And O
I O
agree O
it's O
not O
her O
responsibility. O
I'm O
just O
one O
of O
those O
that O
does O
what O
they O
say O
they O
are O
gonna O
do. O
If O
that O
makes O
sense. O
We O
are O
gonna O
talk O
about O
it O
when O
I O
get O
home O
tonight. O
But O
I'm O
just O
seeing O
if O
maybe O
I O
messed O
up O
our O
relationship O
too O
far O
over O
this..if O
that O
makes O
sense. O
Just O
so O
I O
have O
an O
idea O
on O
how O
I O
should O
talk O
to O
her. O
[SEP]
Even O
if O
the O
dog O
is O
not O
her O
responsibility, O
she O
should O
have O
a O
big O
enough O
heart O
to O
attend O
to O
the O
dog O
if O
needed. O
Dogs O
are O
family. O
I'm O
glad O
you O
prioritise O
your O
pooch O
when O
you O
get O
home. O
[SEP]
…yes, O
anyone O
who O
is O
not O
available O
to O
take O
care O
of O
their O
pets O
should O
not O
have O
them. O
your O
dog O
almost O
DIED O
and O
you O
are O
somehow O
spinning O
that O
story O
to O
make O
yourself O
out O
to O
be O
the O
hero O
that O
saved O
her, O
not O
the O
ignorant O
fool O
who O
put O
her O
in O
that O
position. O
[SEP]
wow O
looks O
like O
some O
of O
your O
family O
members O
behaviour O
has O
rubbed O
off O
on O
you. O
do O
you O
understand O
how O
dogs O
work O
or O
how O
children O
work? O
you O
don’t O
deserve O
a O
dog O
really. O
YOU O
have O
no O
time O
for O
a O
dog O
that O
especially O
needs O
it. O
you’re O
a O
selfish O
person O
and O
making O
yourself O
a O
victim O
in O
a O
situation O
you O
created O
and O
are O
here O
barking O
at O
people O
for O
being O
right O
and O
honest O
to O
you. O
why O
should O
someone O
who O
has O
no O
time O
for O
children O
have O
kids O
anyway? O
are O
you O
dumb? O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
paint O
yourself O
as O
a O
good O
and O
failing O
bc O
ur O
just O
describing O
awful O
shit O
your O
dog O
is O
going O
through O
because O
of O
your O
neglect O
and O
lack O
of O
time. O
dogs O
are O
like O
toddlers O
and O
a O
full O
time O
job. O
if O
you O
cared O
for O
this O
dog O
you’d O
give O
it O
to O
someone O
who O
can O
actually O
care O
for O
it. O
your O
dog O
almost O
died O
because O
of O
YOU O
you O
are O
no O
hero. O
you’re O
a O
dog O
abuser. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
her O
paying O
rent O
was O
a O
way O
to O
communicate O
that O
she O
can O
no O
longer O
take O
the O
dog O
for O
walks. O
Maybe O
you O
should O
find O
an O
alternative O
for O
your O
pet. O
Understandably O
she O
could O
be O
exhausted O
herself O
after O
work. O
[SEP]
I O
can O
see O
she's O
tried O
to O
make O
things O
right O
by O
paying O
rent O
now O
she O
has O
more O
of O
an O
income. O
I'd O
say O
have O
a O
conversation O
about O
it O

This O
is O
why O
you O
shouldn’t O
buy O
stuff O
you O
will O
need O
within O
4 O
months O
on O
Ali, O
especially O
with O
all O
the O
corona O
lockdowns O
going O
on O
there. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Besides O
that O
you O
shouldn’t O
buy O
PC O
parts O
on O
there O
either O
the O
chance O
you O
won’t O
get O
what O
you O
ordered O
is O
gigantic. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
believe O
they O
have O
to O
send O
within O
a O
few O
days O
and O
if O
they O
don’t O
it O
will O
get O
canceled O
automatically. O
Otherwise O
if O
they O
generated O
a O
shipping O
label O
you O
will O
have O
to O
wait O
until O
the O
date O
it O
should O
have O
been O
delivered. O
[SEP]
Similar O
situation O
with O
2 O
orders O
of O
mine, O
they O
face O
a O
lot O
of O
issues O
with O
logistics O
and O
having O
orders O
shipped O
due O
to O
lockdowns. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
regardless O
you O
should O
never O
ever O
rely O
on O
the O
delivery O
date O
on O
such O
long O
shipments. O
Usually O
aliexpress O
gives O
a O
2 O
month O
period O
for O
the O
items O
to O
be O
delivered O
before O
you O
can O
ask O
for O
a O
refund. O
This O
shows O
how O
much O
an O
order O
can O
take O
to O
arrive O
and O
I O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
an O
optimistic O
scenario O
as O
well. O

Update: O

my O

already O
installed O

for O
about O
a O
month O
and O
damn, O
WHAT O
A O
BEAST. O
The O
shipping O
time O
was O
1 O
month O
or O
less, O
just O
as O
expected, O
to O
Brazil, O
things O
are O
shipped O
faster, O
apparently. O
[SEP]
I O
had O
one O
order O
that O

automatically O
cancelled O
and O
the O
money O
was O
refunded O
after O
1 O
week O
when O
the O
seller O
failed O
to O
ship O
the O
item. O
I O
have O
another O
order O
that O
was O
supposedly O
shipped O
on O
Nov O
27th O
yet O
as O
of O
Dec O

there O
is O
no O

it O

up O

[SEP]
In O
my O
region, O
AliExpress O
shipping O
takes O
around O
a O
month, O
so O
it O
would O
be O
no O
problem O
for O
me, O
i O
didn't O
know O
China O
was O
having O

until O

After O
15 O
days O
of O
no O
movement O
on O
the O

Aliexpress O

automatically O
cancel. O
[SEP]
Take O
into O
consideration O
that O
there’s O
a O
very O
complicated O
situation O
in O
china O
currently O
and O
your O

may O
not O
be O
able O
to O

the O

our O
issues O
stem O
from. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
worked O
together O
first, O
and O
became O
friends. O
He O
was O
dating O
someone O
at O
the O
time, O
who O
he'd O
been O
with O
since O
high O
school, O
they O
had O
their O
share O
of O
issues, O
and O
they O
broke O
up. O
We B-Relationship_Status
started I-Relationship_Status
dating, I-Relationship_Status
and O
it O
moved O
pretty O
quickly. O
I O
was O
basically O
living O
with O
him O
at O
this O
point, O
partially O
because O
we O
just O
enjoyed O
being O
together O
but O
also O
I B-Mental_Health
had I-Mental_Health
terrible I-Mental_Health
anxiety I-Mental_Health
and O
admittedly O
felt O
possessive O
over O
him. O
I O
knew O
they O
were O
still O
talking. O
He O
lied O
to O
me O
about O
going O
to O
see O
a O
friend O
to O
get O
him O
out O
of O
a O
bad O
situation O
with O
his O
"alcoholic O
dad", O
went O
to O
spend O
the O
night O
with O
her O
instead, O
and O
he O
still, O
to O
this O
day, O
will O
not O
tell O
me O
the O
truth. O
The O
only O
reason O
I O
know O
what O
actually O
happened O
is O
because O
she O
told O
me, O
and O
that O
the O
friend O
with O
the O
alcoholic O
dad O
is O
a O
family O
friend, O
and O
he O
is O
in O
fact O
not O
an O
alcoholic. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Very O
early O
on O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
was O
pushing O
him O
into O
the O
next O
phase O
of O
our O
relationship. O
Getting O
our O
first O
place O
together, O
buying O
a O
ring, O
proposing... O
all O
of O
that O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
pushed O
him O
to O
do O
when O
maybe O
he O
wasn't O
ready? O
He O
did O
all O
of O
it, O
of O
course, O
he O
didn't O
have O
to, O
I O
never O
forced O
him. O
But O
he O
was O
never O
passionate. O
He O
went O
to O
my B-Family
parents I-Family
to O
ask O
for O
their O
"permission" O
(something O
we O
don't O
believe O
in O
now, O
but O
we O
were O
youngish), O
but O
didn't O
actually O
do O
it. O
Didn't O
plan O
a O
big O
proposal O
when O
he O
knew O
I O
wanted O
that, O
Just... O
didn't O
put O
thought O
into O
those O
things. O
I O
was O
fine O
with O
that O
because O
I O
thought O
maybe O
it O
just O
wasn't O
him, O
and O
I O
accepted O
him O
as O
he O
was. O
Looking O
back O
now O
though O
it O
does O
upset O
me. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
There O
were O
lots O
of O
things O
that O
bothered O
me O
though. O
He O
is O
very O
passive, O
doesn't O
make O
decisions, O
doesn't O
take O
initiative, O
things O
I O
didn't O
think O
were O
a O
big O
deal O
so O
I O
took O
the O
lead O
on O
most O
things O
in O
our O
life. O
I O
decided O
where O
we O
lived, O
our O
budgets, O
I O
took O
on O
the O
"mental O
load". O
I O
was O
fine O
with O
it. O
In O
the O
beginning O
he O
worked O
very O
long O
hours O
at O
a O
physically O
challenging O
job, O
and O
even O
though O
I O
was O
working O
full O
time, O
I O
was O
glad O
to O
do O
all O
of O
those O
things. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
From O
very O
early O
on, O
I O
knew O
he O
lacked O
emotional O
intimacy. O
There O
weren't O
many O
emotional O
conversations. O
No O
cuddling O
just O
to O
cuddle. O
No O
words O
of O
affirmation O
(or O
any O
of O
the O
other O
love O
languages O
for O
that O
matter O
lol). O
Everything O
was O
"fine" O
always. O
DOn't O
get O
me O
wrong. O
He O
is O
a O
great O
man. O
But O
I'd O
say, O
very O
emotionally O
immature. O
Again, O
it O
wasn't O
an O
issue O
before O
because O
we O
didn't O
have O
any O
"real" O
responsibilities O
- O
car O
payments, O
kids, O
pets, O
etc. O
And O
I O
didn't O
need O
the O
emotional O
support, O
emotional O
intimacy, O
communication, O
etc. O
[SEP]

Since O
we've B-Family
had I-Family
kids, I-Family
we I-Family
have I-Family
two I-Family
(7 B-Age
and I-Age
2), I-Age
these O
things O
are O
bigger O
issues O
for O
me. O
Taking O
on O
the O
mental O
load O
is O
more O
difficult O
when O
we O
have O
kids O
and O
pets. O
For O
the O
longest O
time, O
I O
was O
doing O
all O
the O
cleaning, O
planning, O
cooking, O
etc. O
Then O
he O
started O
a O
different O
job O
that O
was O
way O
less O
hours, O
not O
physically O
demanding, O
and O
he O
could O
be O
home O
more. O
He O
didn't O
pick O
up O
any O
slack O
or O
chores O
or O
anything. O
We O
talked, O
he O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
start O
doing O
more O
around O
the O
house. O
Which O
is O
great, O
I'm O
thankful. O
BUT, O
I O
still O
have O
to O
initiate O
the O
tasks O
most O
of O
the O
time, O
unless O
it O
effects O
him O
directly O
(like O
laundry). O
We O
tried O
the O
Fair O
Play O
game, O
that O
helped O
a O
bit, O
but O
again, O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
forcing O
him O
to O
participate. O
Dragging O
him O
along. O
With O
the O
kids, O
I'm O
the O
one O
planning O
and O
executing O
outings, O
and O
then O
I O
have O
to O
drag O
him O
out O
to O
come O
with O
us. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
no O
emotional O
support O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
kids. O
I O
am O
the O
one O
that O
makes O
rules, O
bedtimes, O
pushes O
showers O
and O
teeth O
brushing. O
Makes O
appointments. O
Remembers O
vaccines, O
clothing O
sizes... O
When O
something O
goes O
wrong, O
he O
turns O
it O
around O
on O
me O
and O
it's O
my O
fault. O
But O
then O
I O
feel O
set O
up O
because O
he O
won't O
make O
decisions O
or O
help O
out, O
so O
of O
course O
it's O
my O
fault O
because O
he O
doesn't O
do O
anything. O
He O
won't O
apologize. O
Ever. O
At O
all. O
He O
wrestles O
with O
our O
oldest O
and O
doesn't O
stop O
when O
he O
asks. O
Doesn't O
apologize O
if O
oldest O
is O
hurt. O
Is O
just O
cruel O
sometimes O
with O
us.He O
claims O
our O
son O
lies O
about O
things, O
stupid O
things, O
and O
then O
doesn't O
apologize O
when O
he's O
proven O
wrong. O
He O
does O
not O
praise O
or O
acknowledge O
good O
work O
from O
the O
kids O
or O
me. O
It's O
like O
he O
only O
has O
negative O
thoughts, O
assumes O
the O
worst, O
etc. O
Doesn't O
thank O
anyone. O
I O
can't O
disagree O
with O
him O
at O
all. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
His O
biggest O
gripe O
is O
that O
we O
aren't O
physically O
intimate O
enough. O
Anytime O
I O
try O
to O
talk O
about O
our O
issues, O
the O
issues O
I O
have, O
he O
says O
he O
would O
be O
happier, O
more O
active O
in O
our O
lives, O
if O
we O
had O
more O
sx. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
a O
long O
time O
after O
our O
marriage, O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
asexual. O
I O
had O
no O
desire O
or O
urge O
at O
all. O
But O
I'm O
learning O
that O
all O
of O
these O
things O
that O
I O
thought O
didn't O
matter, O
that O
I O
ignored, O
actually O
do O
matter O
to O
me. O
And O
they O
push O
me O
away O
from O
him. O
I O
don't O
feel O
respected. O
I O
don't O
feel O
loved O
(I O
asked O
him O
during O
our O
last O
serious O
conversation O
whether O
he O
still O
loved O
me. O
He O
said O
he O
"tries O
to O
love" O
me. O
etc?). O
I O
don't O
feel O
appreciated. O
I'm O
learning O
that O
I O
can't O
force O
myself O
to O
be O
physical O
in O
a O
relationship O
that O
doesn't O
have O
those O
things. O
Yes, O
I've O
communicated O
all O
of O
this O
with O
him. O
He O
said O
he O
didn't O
know O
how, O
or O
what O
to O
do, O
or O
that O
he O
was O
already O
giving O
his O
all. O
I O
take O
100% O
of O
the O
responsibility O
on O
this. O
I O
don't O
want O
him O
to O
be O
in O
a O
relationship O
that O
the's O
not O
fulfilled O
in, O
and O
it O
is O
100% O
my O
fault O
that O
we O
aren't O
sexual. O
I O
knew O
all O
of O
these O
things O
were O
issues O
before O
we O
were O
married, O
and O
I O
ignored O
them. O
That's O
on O
me. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
At O
the O
same O
time O
though, O
I O
keep O
hearing O
"If O
he O
wanted O
to, O
he O
would." O
If O
he O
loved O
me, O
cared O
for O
me, O
appreciated O
me, O
he O
would O
be O
making O
an O
effort. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
There O
is O
no O
effort. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
I O
am O
also O
at O
fault O
in O
this O
relationship O
situation. O
Don't O
get O
me O
wrong. O
I B-Mental_Health
have I-Mental_Health
ADHD, I-Mental_Health
Anxiety, I-Mental_Health
depression, I-Mental_Health
I'm O
terrible O
at O
managing O
money O
and O
budgets. O
I O
have O
my O
own O
issues. O
But O
I O
do O
try. O
So O
hard. O
I'm B-Other
in I-Other
therapy. I-Other
I'm I-Other
on I-Other
meds. I-Other
I'm O
really O
trying. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
I'm O
fucking O
exhausted O
of O
feeling O
like O
I'm O
the O
only O
one O
trying O
here. O
If O
all O
of O
these O
red O
flags O
that O
I O
ignored O
14 O
years O
ago O
still O
exist, O
I O
can't O
expect O
him O
to O
change O
to O
become O
what O
I O
need. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But, O
we O
have O
kids. O
I O
still O
have O
hope O
that O
things O
will O
get O
better. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
they O
haven't O
got O
better. O
Am O
I O
the O
shitty O
one O
here? O
Can O
I O
just O
get O
some O
input? O
Validation? O
Or O
slap O
me O
with O
some O
reality? O
Being O
an O
adult O
really O
fucking O
sucks. O
[SEP]
My O
thoughts O
are. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
His O
ex O
might O
have O
been O
the O
love O
of O
his O
life O
fantasy O
type O
of O
thing. O
He O
essentially O
was O
dating O
you O
and O
slept O
with O
his O
ex, O
possibly O
in O
hopes O
of O
something O
becoming O
more O
again. O
Not O
nice. O
But O
you O
need O
to O
let O
go O
of O
the O
past O
and O
it O
was O
14 O
years O
ago. O
He O
does O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
issues O
though. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
he's O
not O
feeling O
it O
and O
neither O
are O
you. O
It's O
unlikely O
he O
will O
change O
and O
it's O
unlikely O
you O
will O
want O
to O
jump O
into O
bed O
with O
him. O
Does O
that O
mean O
divorce? O
Probably O
not. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
you O
need O
some O
self-care O
outside O
of O
this O
constellation. O
Pick O
up O
some O
hobbies, O
concentrate O
on O
that. O
You O
need O
to O
stop O
caring O
so O
much, O
analysing O
and O
picking O
up O
the O
slack, O
He O
complains O
about O
you O
doing O
too O
much, O
not O
enough, O
not O
perfect O
enough, O
it O
needs O
to O
go O
over O
your O
head O
and O
he O
needs O
to O
step O
up O
and O
you O
slow O
down. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
will O
likely O
not O
change. O
He O
seems O
really O
reactive O
and O
that's O
probably O
the O
turn O
off O
for O
you O
sexually, O
it's O
not O
that O
you're O
asexual, O
it's O
that O
you're O
not O
connected. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
here's O
what O
you O
do: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Since O
he's O
reactive O
maybe O
just O
love O
him O
for O
who O
he O
is O
and O
accept O
him. O
Warts O
and O
all. O
If O
you O
can O
manage O
that, O
great! O
If O
you O
can't, O
you O
need O
to O
learn O
this O
for O
yourself. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Sex O
can O
only O
come O
with O
connection. O
He O
has O
hobbies? O
Let O
him O
carry O
them O
out, O
leave O
him O
be. O
If O
he O
wants O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
you, O
ok, O
watch O
his O
movies, O
eat O
the O
foods O
he O
likes. O
Find O
his O
jokes O
funny O
again. O
If O
not, O
the O
grown O
man O
has O
friends O
and O
you O
go O
live O
his O
life. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
there's O
no O
give O
without O
take. O
He O
needs O
to O
do O
more O
things O
he's O
good O
at, O
maybe O
cleaning, O
maybe O
task, O
without O
you O
telling O
him O
to. O
You O
need O
to O
take O
whatever O
you O
feel O
you O
need. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
do O
loads O
to O
build O
a O
connection O
without O
giving O
in O
to O
sex. O
Sex O
will O
come O
with O
a O
decent O
connection O
and O
once O
it O
feel O
natural O
again, O
things O
will O
start O
on O
a O
better O
foot O
than O
now. O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
you O
guys O
need O
marriage O
counseling O
asap. O
Good O
luck O

but O
the O
impact O
of O
the O
progesterone O
after O

Second O

First O

so O
the O

it O
succeeds. O

I O

My O
doctor O

Just O

this! O
i O

yet. O
but O
i’m O
also O
worried O
about O
all O
the O

‘actually’ O

i O

i’ll O
be O
needing O

mine O

i O
can O
then O
start O
the O

good O

to O
you! O
[SEP]
I O
know, O
it’s O
going O

Waiting O
for O
(hopefully) O
ovulation, O
then O
the O
tww, O
then O
provera O
again, O
repeat. O
I’m O
hoping O
doing O
some O

helps O
my O
stress. O
[SEP]
i O

My O

it O

me O
suddenly O

made O
my O

well O

no O

at O

Has O
anyone O

had O
bad O

[SEP]
It O
made O
me O
feel O
like O
I O

drunk-drunk. O
Felt O
like O
I O
was O
moving O
around O
underwater O
and O
dizzy. O
I O
was O
prescribed O
it O
for O
nerve O

but O
only O
ever O
took O
it O
once. O
That O
was O
more O
than O
enough O
for O
me. O
I O
do O
know O
the O
other O
commenter O
is O
absolutely O
right O
about O
the O

I've O
seen O
many O
people O
go O
through O
it. O
I O
hope O
you O
find O
something O
that O
helps, O
but O
if O
it O
makes O
you O
feel O
weird O
and O
makes O
your O

swell O
this O
probably O
isn't O
it. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
don't O
like O
it O
wean O
off O
as O
soon O
as O
possible. O
It's O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O
withdrawal O
I've O
ever O
gone O
through. O
Worse O
than O
benzos O
withdrawal. O
I O
was O
on O
900mg O
3x O
day O
for O
about O
six O
months. O
Near O
the O
end O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
losing O
my O
mind. O
The O
brain O
fog O
was O
so O
intense O
and O
my O
vision O
was O
awful. O
[SEP]
100 O
mg O
2x O
day O
chilled O
me O
out O
and O
helped O
some O
with O
blurry O
vision. O
200 O
mg O
2x O
day O
knocked O
me O
out O
with O
exhaustion. O
I O
gained O
~5 O
lbs O
in O
the O
3 O
months O
I O
was O
on O
gaba, O
and O
my O
face O
was O
puffy O
as O
well. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
because O
it O
made O
my O
tits O
hurt O
so O
fucking O
bad O
hahaha. O
Looked O
it O
up O
and O
in O
like O
1% O
of O
people O
it O
causes O
severe O
breast O
pain. O
Of O
course O
I O
was O
in O
the O
1%. O
Overall, O
even O
if O
it O
only O
helped O
my O
auras O
a O
little, O
I O
loved O
gaba O
for O
my O
anxiety. O
[SEP]
Those O
are O
known O
side O
effects. O
[SEP]
They O
gave O
me O
300 O
mg O
and O
it O
knocked O
me O
out. O
Then, O
100 O
mg O
which O
didn’t O
do O
anything. O
[SEP]
Omg O
is O
that O
why O
my O
face O
is O
puffy? O
Did O
it O
go O
away O
for O
y'all? O
[SEP]
I'm O
on O
gaba... O
Made O
me O
"stupid" O
in O
the O
begining. O
But O
your O
body O
adjusts. O
Weight O
gain O
can O
be O
a O
side O
effect. O
Not O
sure O
about O
the O
puffy O
face O
tho. O
Give O
Dr O
a O
call O
maybe. O
The O
withdrawals O
from O
it O
aren't O
fun... O
I've O
done O
it O
twice O
.. O
but O
it's O
better O
than O
say O
Lyrica. O
If O
you O
can O
try O
to O
give O
the O

a O
chance O
otherwise O
move O
onto O
the O
next O
option. O
[SEP]
Yup, O
crap O
medicine O
for O

A O

put O
me O
on O
it O
for O
a O
while O
until O
I O
complained O
it O
did O
not O
help O

made O
me O

That O
and O
Topamax O
should O
not O
be O
prescribed O
for O
migraine, O
ever, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
but O
what O
do O
I O
know O
:/ O
[SEP]
Exactly O
what O
happened O
to O
me. O
Took O
it O
once O

never O
again. O
Dr O

it O

one O
of O

[SEP]
Ooh O
that O
might O
be O
why O
my O

hurt O
too O

That's O

I O
have O

I O

on O

levels. O
I O
never O
thought O
about O
it O

Basically O
just O
means O
they O

again O
and O
it O
will O

The O
first O
step O
is O
to O
have O
the O
pet O
dog O
you're O
wanting O
to O
train O
evaluated O
by O
a O
canine O
behavioralist O
or O
a O
professional O
trainer O
who's O
experienced O
in O
service O
dog O
training O
to O
see O
if O
they O
have O
potential O
as O
a O
candidate. O
It O
is O
much O
more O
likely O
for O
a O
dog O
to O
not O
have O
the O
right O
temperament O
for O
service O
work O
than O
it O
is O
for O
them O
to O
be O
suited O
for O
it, O
and O
because O
training O
is O
so O
incredibly O
expensive O
and O
takes O
so O
long O
(usually O
around O
2 O
years), O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
be O
starting O
out O
with O
a O
prospect O
that O
has O
no O
chance O
of O
succeeding. O
That's O
why O
it's O
important O
to O
get O
an O
evaluation O
first, O
before O
you O
start O
investing O
time O
and O
money O
into O
training. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
this O
current O
dog O
is O
a O
suitable O
prospect, O
the O
next O
step O
would O
be O
to O
get O
set O
up O
with O
a O
trainer O
who O
can O
help O
you O
through O
the O
process. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
this O
current O
dog O
is O
not O
a O
suitable O
prospect, O
whether O
that's O
because O
of O
temperament, O
behavioral O
habits, O
age, O
etc, O
the O
next O
step O
would O
be O
to O
acquire O
a O
new O
prospect O
and O
to O
potentially O
figure O
out O
a O
rehoming O
option O
for O
your O
current O
dog O
if O
owning O
two O
dogs O
at O
once O
isn't O
possible O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Something O
else O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
is O
that O
if O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
dog O
to O
be O
a O
cardiac O
alert O
service O
dog, O
your O
best O
bet O
is O
to O
get O
a O
service O
dog O
from O
a O
program O
as O
opposed O
to O
owner O
training O
one. O
Cardiac O
alerts O
are O
currently O
not O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
type O
of O
alert O
that O
can O
be O
trained O
and O
instead O
require O
a O
natural O
ability O
from O
the O
dog. O
If O
cardiac O
alert O
is O
a O
task O
that O
you O
need O
a O
service O
dog O
to O
perform, O
getting O
a O
program O
dog O
is O
a O
much O
safer O
bet O
because O
then O
you O
know O
that O
dog O
will O
be O
able O
to O
do O
that O
task O
as O
opposed O
to O
rolling O
the O
dice O
and O
hoping O
the O
dog O
you O
attempt O
to O
owner O
train O
ends O
up O
able O
to O
do O
it. O
[SEP]
Well, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
this: O
it's O
allowed. O
There's O
no O
rule O
about O
who O
can O
and O
can't O
train O
a O
service O
animal, O
no O
certifications O
or O
licenses O
involved. O
And, O
there's O
no O
tests O
or O
anything O
for O
an O
animal O
you've O
trained O
to O
count. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
However, O
consider O
your O
position: O
you're O
asking O
Reddit O
how O
to O
train O
a O
dog O
to O
do O
something O
with O
your O
life O
in O
the O
balance. O
That O
screams O
"bad O
idea." O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
want O
to O
do O
this, O
first O
you O
have O
to O
train O
yourself O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
train O
dogs, O
and O
familiarize O
yourself O
with O
the O
process O
of O
training O
a O
service O
animal, O
and O
then O
re-visit O
this. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Until O
then, O
I'd O
suggest O
a O
medical O
alert O
system O
with O
fall O
detection O
as O
a O
stopgap O
[SEP]
I O
have O
experience O
with O
service O
dogs O
and O
"service O
dog O
trainers." O
The O
rules O
regarding O
service O
dogs O
are O
extremely O
flexible O
(too O
much O
so; O
bad O
people O
often O
take O
advantage O
of O
them) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
advice O
based O
on O
my O
experience: O
work O
with O
a O
dog O
that O
has O
a O
very O
good O
bond O
with O
you. O
The O
closer O
you O
are O
to O
him/her, O
the O
more O
likely O
that O
he/she O
will O
be O
in-tune O
with O
your O
body O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
don't O
have O
to O
formally O
train O
a O
dog O
for O
him/her O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
your O
body. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you're O
in O
an O
emergency O
state- O
that O
dog O
will O
*take O
care O
of O
you,* O
instinctively O
[SEP]
While O
training O
with O
a O
professional O
trainer O
isn’t O
required, O
you O
do O
still O
have O
to O
train O
a O
dog O
to O
do O
tasks. O
The O
vast O
majority O
of O
dogs O
aren’t O
just O
going O
to O
instinctively O
do O
task O
work O
simply O
because O
they O
have O
a O
bond O
with O
their O
owner O
like O
your O
saying O
they O
will. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
even O
if O
a O
dog O
does O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
natural O
alert O
or O
response, O
it O
doesn’t O
legally O
count O
as O
a O
task O
unless O
that O
natural O
alert/response O
is O
then O
shaped O
and O
reinforced O
as O
the O
ADA O
specifically O
states O
it O
has O
to O
be O
trained. O
[SEP]
"the O

- O
this O
particular O
person O
mentioned O
that O
they O
pass O
out. O
Not O
every O
dog O
would O
respond O
well O
to O
task O
work O
like O
"press O
emergency O
button," O
but O
any O
dog O
would O
start O
barking O
its O
head O
off O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
its O
owner O
passed O
out O
on O
the O
ground O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
guess O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
think O
more O
flexibly O
like O
"how O
can O
a O
person O
own O
a O
dog O
that O
can O
help O
save O
their O
life O
- O
without O
having O
to O
'train O
it' O
according O
to O
ADA O
standards" O
[SEP]
No O
actually O
the O
majority O
of O
dogs O
won’t O
do O
that O
either. O
They O
may O
be O
slightly O
concerned O
or O
scared O
at O
first O
and O
then O
ignore/move O
away O
from O
their O
owner O
or O
even O
attempt O
to O
initiate O
play, O
but O
barking O
isn’t O
something O
a O
lot O
dogs O
will O
do O
in O
that O
situation. O
Especially O
not O
with O
the O
actual O
purpose O
of O
getting O
attention. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
type O
of O
thing O
must O
either O
be O
shaped O
or O
trained. O
And O
OP O
was O
specifically O
asking O
about O
having O
their O
pet O
dog O
become O
a O
service O
dog, O
which O
would O
need O
to O
meet O
the O
ADA O
definition O
and O
requirements O
to O
be O
a O
service O
dog. O
If O
it O
isn’t O
trained O
to O
that O
then O
it O
isn’t O
a O
service O
dog. O
[SEP]
Ugh O

viewpoint O
based O

my O
experience O
and O
you O
have O
yours. O
Have O
a O
good O
one O
[SEP]
Literally O
- O
tasks O
must O
be O
trained O
in O
order O
to O
count. O
Full O
stop. O
A O
bond O
and O
'natural O

do O
not O

the O

definition O
of O
a O

dog. O
[SEP]
I O
"know* O
the O
tasks O
are O
required O
so O
a O
dog O
can O
legally O
be O
considered O
a O
service O
animal O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
in O
my O
experience, O
dog O
trainers O
often O
don't O
understand O
the O
disabled O
person's O
needs O
(and O
therefore O
they O
don't O
understand O
the O
tasks O
that O
they O
need O
to O
train O
the O
dog) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Personally, O
I O
don't O
think O
we O
need O
to O
train O
complicated O
tasks O
because O
when O
we O
develop O
strong O
bonds O
with O
animals, O
they O
can O
sense O
when O
we're O
in O
a O
medical O

a O
shopping O
addiction. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
currently O
has O
a O
couple O
thousand O
dollars O
in O
credit O
card O
debt O
and O
has O
taken O
out O
about O
$9k O
in O
several O
personal O
loans O
(with O
sky O
high O
interest, O
which O
she O
has O
used O
to O
pay O
off O
her O
past O
credit O
card O
debt). O
She O
also O
has O
been O
maxing O
out O
her O
student O
loans O
every O
semester O
to O
pay O
on O
her O
credit O
cards. O
(To O
make O
matters O
worse, O
she O
isn’t O
doing O
very O
well O
grade-wise O
but O
refuses O
to O
change O
her O
major O
to O
something O
more O
suited O
to O
her) O
She O
goes O
on O
large O
shopping O
sprees O
every O
couple O
weeks O
buying O
makeup, O
clothes O
and O
shoes. O
Our O
bedroom O
is O
overflowing O
with O
all O
her O
purchases, O
a O
lot O
of O
which O
she O
only O
wears O
a O
couple O
times. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
doesn’t O
have O
the O
greatest O
job O
either O
and O
only O
works O
part-time. O
She O
also O
bought O
a O
brand O
new O
vehicle O
for O
$25k O
on O
which O
the O
payment O
and O
insurance O
eats O
up O
over O
half O
of O
her O
income. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
love O
her O
but O
I’m O
finding O
it O
hard O
to O
wrap O
my O
head O
around O
what O
she O
does. O
I’m O
concerned O
that O
we O
will O
never O
be O
able O
to O
get O
a O
place O
of O
our O
own O
due O
to O
her O
debt-to-income O
ratio, O
let O
alone O
be O
able O
to O
one O
day O
buy O
a O
house. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Am O
I O
overreacting? O
If O
not, O
is O
there O
anything O
I O
can O
do O
to O
support O
her O
and O
help O
her O
see O
that O
this O
isn’t O
sustainable? O
[SEP]
You O
don't O
even O
have O
your O
own O
place, O
she's O
blowing O
money, O
and O
taking O
out O
loans O
with O
high O
interest??? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Ruh O
oh! O
You O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
her O
and O
set O
your O
priorities...if O
you O
live O
with O
family O
you O
do O
everything O
you O
can O
to O
be O
independent O
and O
I've O
been O
there. O
I O
don't O
like O
having O
to O
rely O
on O
anyone O
else, O
ever. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also, O
don't O
do O
anything O
stupid O
before O
you O
get O
this O
sorted. O
If O
she's O
not O
willing O
to O
adapt O
I O
guess O
is O
the O
word O
I'll O
use O
this O
may O
be O
a O
problem O
you O
have O
to O
live O
with O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life, O
unless O
divorce. O
[SEP]
Certainly O
tell O
her O
how O
this O
is O
affecting O
you. O
Sometimes O
people O
don't O
realize O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
until O
they O
are O
told. O
See O
if O
you O
can O
help O
her O
come O
up O
with O
a O
plan O
to O
get O
back O
on O
track O
and O
get O
to O
a O
better O
financial O
state. O
Being O
in O
college O
is O
hard, O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
she O
may O
not O
have O
developed O
the O
skills O
to O
manage O
money O
prior O
to O
college. O
A O
lot O
of O
people O
(including O
myself) O
have O
been O
there. O
Try O
not O
to O
demean O
her O
or O
talk O
down O
to O
her O
-- O
the O
world O
is O
set O
up O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
designed O
to O
make O
people O
like O
her O
continue O
what O
she O
is O
doing, O
in O
order O
to O
maximize O
profit O
off O
of O
her. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Remember O
that O
it O
is O
a O
gradual O
process O
-- O
you O
won't O
see O
progress O
overnight. O
She O
might O
have O
to O
take O
the O
time O
to O
see O
a O
therapist, O
if O
there O
is O
something O
that O
she O
is O
trying O
to O
compensate O
for. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
remember O
first O
and O
foremost, O
that O
she O
has O
to O
be O
willing O
to O
help O
herself. O
If O
you O
express O
how O
you O
feel O
and O
she O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
take O
it O
seriously, O
use O
that O
information O
for O
your O
next O
move. O
[SEP]
All O
good O
advice O
here, O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
add O
when O
you O
do O
approach O
her O
don’t O
do O
so O
from O
an O
accusatory O
place. O
It O
sounds O
like O
she’s O
dealing O
with O
a O
lot O
mentally O
(addiction O
is O
all O
about O
filling O
a O
void), O
and O
she O
may O
see O
it O
as O
an O
attack O
and O
crawl O
deeper O
into O
the O
hole. O
Be O
firm O
but O
gentle, O
and O
show O
her O
how O
you O
can O
help O
her O
too O
[SEP]
If O
she O
has O
a O
shopping O
addiction, O
she O
may O
need O
therapy O
to O
address O
the O
issues, O
as O
for O
some O
they O
get O
a O
high O
from O
shopping, O
or O
it O
helps O
ease O
stress. O
On O
top O
of O
that O
she O
is O
young, O
and O
might O
not O
have O
received O
proper O
financial O
guidance O
earlier O
on O
in O
her O
life. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Your O
concerns O
are O
valid O
and O
I O
suggest O
you O
present O
them O
to O
her O
in O
the O
kindest O
way O
possible, O
that O
you O
are O
worried O
for O
her O
and O
your O
future O
together. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Even O
too, O
what O
is O
her O
social O
media O
usage O
like? O
Is O
she O
being O
easily O
swayed O
by O
influencers? O
[SEP]
If O
she's O
in O

please O
see O
if O
there O
are O

at O
the O
very O
least O
I'd O
like O
the O
clients O
that O
don't O
want O
to O
share O
to O
at O
least O
be O
quiet O
and/or O
observant. O
I've O
had O
clients O
come O
up O
to O
me O
after O
group O
and O
express O
their O
frustrations, O
which O
I O
certainly O
understand. O
I O
feel O
responsible O
because O
I've O
been O
unsuccessful O
at O
keeping O
the O
group O
from O
getting O
rowdy. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
here O
are O
my O
questions: O
[SEP]
1) O
has O
anyone O
here O
ever O
facilitated O
group O
therapy O
for O
30+ O
people O
with O
success? O
[SEP]
2) O
if O
you O
were O
successful, O
what O
did O
you O
do O
to O
make O
it O
work? O
[SEP]
[SEP]

Any O
suggestions O
are O
greatly O
appreciated. O

AITA O
for O
moving O
my O
TV O
back O
into O
my O
room O
after O
my O
roommates O
kept O
leaving O
the O
door O
unlocked? O
[SEP]
So O
I O
(19f) B-Age_Gender
live O
in O
a O
small O
apartment O
complex. O
My O
roommates O
(m&amp;f) O
have O
a O
habit O
of O
leaving O
the O
front O
door O
of O
our O
apartment O
unlocked O
and O
unattended. O
I've O
mentioned O
many O
times O
it O
makes O
me O
uncomfortable O
unless O
someone O
is O
in O
the O
common O
area O
hanging O
out O
or O
something. O
If O
they're O
in O
the O
common O
area, O
I O
don't O
care. O
[SEP]
My O
TV O
is O
out O
there O
for O
everyone O
to O
use. O
But O
with O
the O
door O
being O
unlocked, O
I B-Finance
have I-Finance
felt I-Finance
unsafe I-Finance
with I-Finance
it I-Finance
since I-Finance
I I-Finance
can't I-Finance
afford I-Finance
to I-Finance
replace I-Finance
it. I-Finance
The O
door O
being O
unlocked O
has O
happened O
so O
many O
times, O
and O
I O
finally O
told O
them O
that O
if O
it O
keeps O
happening, O
I'm O
going O
to O
have O
to O
move O
my O
TV O
into O
my O
room O
to O
have O
my O
own O
peace O
of O
mind. O
[SEP]
Since O
I O
told O
them O
that, O
it O
happened O
a O
good O
couple O
more O
times O
and O
I O
kept O
thinking O
to O
myself O
"you O
know, O
it's O
daytime, O
they're O
getting O
used O
to O
it, O
one O
more O
chance," O
and O
I'd O
just O
locked O
the O
door O
and O
carry O
on. O
[SEP]
The O
issue O
came O
when O
last O
night, O
everyone O
was O
in O
there O
rooms, O
I O
couldn't O
sleep. O
I O
got O
up O
around O
4am O
to O
go O
get O
water. O
I O
walk O
into O
the O
living O
room O
(no O
one O
in O
it), O
and O
the O
door O
is O
unlocked. O
It O
was O
4am. O
Way O
different O
then O
daytime. O
And O
that O
was O
my O
last O
straw. O
I O
immediately O
moved O
the O
TV O
into O
my O
room O
and O
didn't O
say O
anything. O
[SEP]
When O
asked O
the O
next O
day, O
I O
said O
"oh O
the O
door O
was O
unlocked O
at O
4am O
and O
no O
one O
was O
in O
here, O
so O
I O
felt O
safer O
with O
it O
in O
my O
room O
from O
now O
on." O
And O
there O
was O
some O
arguing O
saying O
it O
wasn't O
when O
I O
know O
it O
was, O
because O
I O
locked O
it O
afterwards, O
and O
then O
silent O
treatment. O
[SEP]
And O
I O
feel O
guilty O
because O
I O
don't O
want O
them O
to O
hate O
me, O
but O
I O
couldn't O
keep O
having O
my O
boundaries O
disrespected, O
as O
I've O
respected O
all O
of O
their's, O
and O
I O
don't O
feel O
safe O
having O
it O
at O
risk O
anymore. O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
was O
my O
right, O
and O
it's O
not O
even O
to O
punish O
anyone, O
it's O
just O
to O
protect O
my O
thing O
that O
I O
worked O
hard O
to O
purchase. O
[SEP]
AITA O
for O
moving O
it O
in O
my O
room? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Update: O
Thank O
you O
to O
everyone O
who O
commented. O
It O
made O
me O
feel O
so O
much O
better. O
[SEP]
(1) O
I O
am O
in O
a O
year O
long O
lease O
with O
about O
10 O
more O
months O
to O
go, O
so O
moving O
out O
isn't O
an O
option. O
[SEP]
(2) O
I O
lock O
my O
bedroom O
door O
constantly. O
Even O
right O
now O
as O
I'm O
in O
it. O
It O
is O
locked. O
And O
I've O
finally O
set O
up O
a O
camera O
in O
my O
room O
for O
when O
I O
leave. O
[SEP]
(3) O
I'm O
glad O
I'm O
not O
the O
bad O
roommate O
here. O
Im O
being O
made O
to O
feel O
like O
I O
am, O
which O
sucks. O
I've O
been O
told O
by O
a O
friend O
that O
I O
should O
try O
to O
"keep O
the O
peace" O
and O
"be O
friends" O
because O
I O
have O
to O
live O
with O
them, O
but O
tbh, O
(1) O
I've O
never O
blamed O
them. O
I O
gave O
many O
warnings O
and O
stated O
that O
it O
had O
everything O
to O
do O
with O
ME O
being O
anxious O
about O
the O
door O
being O
unlocked. O
And O
(2) O
if O
someone O
gets O
this O
mad/rude O
over O
someone O
setting O
a O
simple O
boundary, O
then O
why O
would O
I O
want O
them O
as O
a O
friend. O
As O
a O
roommate O
friendship O
isn't O
my O
priority; O
respect O
for O
each O
other O
(and O
each O
other's O
boundaries) O
is O
most O
important. O
(Also, O
this O
isn't O
the O
first O
instance O
of O
me O
setting O
a O
boundary O
and O
being O
treated O
differently O
after, O
so O
I O
started O
to O
think O
I O
was O
the O
problem). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Anyway, O
thank O
you O
guys O
so O
much. O
I'm O
content O
in O
my O
decision, O
and O
I'm O
going O
to O
enjoy O
my O
bedroom O
TV O

Seriously, O
what's O

Locking O

It's O
not O
an O
unreasonable O
request O

lock O
the O
friggin' O

their O

thing O

biy O
their O
own O

My O

make O
sure O
you O
all O
don't O
end O
up O

the O

that O
were O
just O
murdered O
in O
Idaho O
USA O
in O
an O
off O

house. O

NTA O
this O

worrying O

I O
can't O
imagine O
being O
a O

who's O
just O
ok O
with O
the O
front O
door O
being O
unlocked O
at O
4am, O
especially O
after O
being O
told O
many O
times O
it O
makes O
a O

anxious. O
You O
did O
all O
you O
needed O

what O
was O
going O
to O
happen, O
they're O
the O
ones O
who O
didn't O
bother O

4am. O

When O
asked O
the O

said O
"oh O
the O

unlocked O
at O
4am O

no O
one O
was O
in O
here, O
so O
I O
felt O
safer O

And O
there O
was O
some O
arguing O
saying O
it O
wasn't O
when O
I O
know O
it O
was, O
because O
I O
locked O
it O
afterwards, O
and O
then O
silent O
treatment. O
[SEP]
And O
I O
feel O
guilty O
because O
I O
don't O
want O
them O
to O
hate O
me, O
but O
I O
couldn't O
keep O
having O
my O
boundaries O
disrespected, O
as O
I've O
respected O
all O
of O
their's, O
and O
I O
don't O
feel O
safe O
having O
it O
at O
risk O
anymore. O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
was O
my O
right, O
and O
it's O
not O
even O
to O
punish O
anyone, O
it's O
just O

I’ve B-Occupation
been I-Occupation
writing I-Occupation
scripts I-Occupation
here I-Occupation
and I-Occupation
there I-Occupation
for I-Occupation
years I-Occupation
but I-Occupation
never I-Occupation
had I-Occupation
any I-Occupation
luck I-Occupation
selling I-Occupation
them. I-Occupation
So O
I O
decided O
to O
narrow O
my O
focus O
and O
write O
something O
that O
would O
be O
easier O
to O
film. O
No O
car O
chases O
or O
creature O
effects. O
Also O
I O
personally O
love O
high O
concept, O
cerebral O
ideas O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
write O
a O
High O
Concept O
Low O
Budget O
horror O
screenplay… O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
it O
worked! O
I O
sold O
it O
and O
it’s O
In O
post O
production O
now. O
I O
think O
I O
want O
to O
keep O
writing O
in O
this O
format O
and O
see O
if O
I O
can O
do O
it O
again. O
Kinda O
make O
it O
my O
thing. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
hoping O
to O
hear O
from O
other O
writers O
about O
if O
they O
tailor O
their O
writing O
to O
fit O
into O
a O
certain O
style O
or O
if O
they O
hope O
to O
make O
a O
name O
for O
themselves O
by O
writing O
a O
screenplays O
of O
only O
types. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also O
any O
other O
writers O
who O
write O
similar O
screenplays, O
what O
have O
been O
your O

it O
make O

I O
don't O
really O
do O
the O
Hollywood O
thing O
anymore. O
Did O
that O
back O
in O
the O
80s O
and O
90s. O
These O
days, O
at O
my O
age, O
I O
love O
writing O
simple, O
character-driven O
low O
budget O
movies O
for O
independent O
producers. O
The O
pay O
is O
not O
great, O
certainly O
not O
by O
Hollywood O
standards, O
but O
the O
movies O
get O
made. O
A O
movie O
I O
wrote O
last O
year O
is O
in O
post O
now. O
I O
can't O
wait O
to O
see O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
you O
got O
a O
good O
plan O
working O
for O
you. O
Wishing O
you O
continued O
success. O
[SEP]
That’s O
basically O
the O
Blumhouse O
model. O
Jason O
has O
wondered O
out O
loud O
why O
others O
aren’t O
adopting O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
also O
wrote O
a O
high O
concept, O
low O
budget O
banger O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
attracting O
a O
producer. O
And O
that O
script O
is O
out O
with O
an O
A-list O
production O
company O
off O
a O
cold O
query. O
[SEP]
Right O
now O
I’m O
working O
on O
a O
comedy O
pilot O
that, O
after O
looking O
at O
the O
pitch O
deck, O
said O
he O
“can’t O
think O
of O
a O
more O
complicated O
comedy” O
but O
that O
“the O
script O
could O
be O
great.” O
Another O
producer O
read O
the O
script O
and O
said O
it O
was O
“hilarious O
and O
like O
It’s O
Always O
Sunny O
meets O
Half O
Baked” O
so O
the O
complexity O
of O
it O
seems O
to O
range. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
writing O
something O
simple O
yet O
fucking O
bonkers O
is O
so O
fun O
and O
uninhabiting. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Congrats O
on O
selling O
the O
script! O
I O
can’t O
wait O
to O
see O
a O
post O
when O
it O
finally O
comes O
out! O

Think O
about O
the O
economics O

that O
and O
figure O
out O
if O
it's O

How O
long O
did O
it O
take O
to O
write O
the O
script? O
How O
much O
did O
you O
get O
paid O
for O
it? O
How O
many O
would O
you O
need O
to O
write O
in O
a O
year O
(and O
sell) O
to O
quit O
your O
day O
job? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Solid O
high-concept O
low-budget O
scripts O
are O
more O
difficult O
to O
write O
than O
if O
you O
had O
no O
budgetary O
restrictions. O
Ironically, O
the O
compensation O
for O
the O
added O
difficulty O
is O
diametrically O
lowered, O
since O
the O
film O
budget O
is O
limited. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I'm O
not O
saying O
don't O
do O
it O
again. O
We O
all O
need O
to O
have O
realistic O
producible O
work O
in O
our O
portfolio. O
But O
do O
not O
limit O
yourself. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Good O

[SEP]
And O
again O
- O
congrats. O
[SEP]
Post O
the O
script O
or O
at O

a O
log O

you O
fucking O
tease O
[SEP]
I O
love O
writing O
low O
budget O
stuff. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
me O
it O
was O
an O
obvious O
move. O
Would O
I O
give O
a O
first O
timer O
millions O
for O
anything? O
No. O
So O
if O
you O
write O
something O
people O
are O
will O
to O
risk O
some O
cash O
on O
(low O
budget), O
you O
have O
a O
better O
chance. O
[SEP]
Can O
I O
ask O
what O
you O
mean O
by O
high O
concept O
cerebral O
ideas O
because O
that O
sounds O
almost O
like O
an O
oxymoron O
to O
me. O
[SEP]
Did O
you O
still O
get O
a O
decent O
payday? O
I'm O
scared O
that O
if O
I'm O
*too* O
budget-friendly, O
I'll O
only O
harm O
my O
potential O
earnings. O
[SEP]
that's O
awesome O
congratulations!! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
did O
you O
have O
to O
change O
anything O
from O
the O
original O
script? O
& O
also, O
could O
you O
had O
been O
part O
of O
the O
assisting O
directing O
if O
you O
requested O
possibly? O
given O
that O
it O
was O
your O
vision O
and O
message O
its O
only O
right O
but O
since O
they O
paid O
i O
doubt O
it O
right? O

I O
have O
a O
thriller/horror O
that O

takes O

over O

night O
at O
a O
ranch. O
A O

who O
read O
a O

it’s O
almost O

there O
are O
a O
few O

a O

Unlike O
Hollywood O
where O
writer O
rates O
are O
dictated O
by O
the O
Writers O
Guild, O
low O
budget O
independent O
prices O
depend O
on O
what O

work O
for O

what O
you O
can O
get. O
Five O
grand, O
ten O
grand, O
twenty O
grand. O
Whatever. O
It O
just O
depends. O
Sometimes O
you O
work O
cheap O
in O
the O
hopes O
the O

take O
off O

The O

help. O
Many O

All O
children O
in O
foster O
care O
have O
trauma O
behaviors, O
and O
every O
move O
worsens O
them. O
We O
recruit O
too O
many O
untrained O
foster O
families. O
A O
child O
being O
harmed O
is O
never O
the O
fault O
of O
the O
child. O
Foster O
care O
often O
harms O
the O
children O
more O
than O
the O
original O
bio O
family O
due O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
trauma O
and O
its O

I O
will O
be O
honest, O
the O
amount O
of O
homes O
is O
going O
to O
have O
caused O
a O
lot O
of O
pain O
and O
damage, O
but O
**it O
isn't O
his O
fault.** O
I'm O
sure O
many O
were O
also O
abusive O
emotionally O
(even O
if O
unintentional O
- O
many O
people O
use O
traditional O
parenting O
methods O
of O
punishment O
not O
understanding O
it O
is O
harmful O
and O
abusive O
to O
traumatized O
kids), O
just O
due O
to O
the O
statistical O
odds, O
and O
caused O
his O
pain O
to O
deepen. O
I O
could O
take O
a O
perfect O
super O
child, O
from O
the O
best O
family O
in O
the O
world, O
and O
if O
you O
put O
that O
child O
through O
what O
that O
foster O
child O
has O
been O
through, O
they O
would O
act O
the O
same O
way. O
Heck, O
if O
I O
took O
an O
adult, O
they O
would O
act O
the O
same O
way O
(if O
not O
worse). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
hard O
journey O
(but O
if O
you O
have O
the O
right O
mindset, O
amazing, O
because O
you're O
helping O
an O
abused O
child O
and O
growing O
as O
a O
person O
yourself O
to O
be O
more O
patient, O
loving, O
empathetic, O
and O
strong) O
and O
you're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
dedicate O
yourself O
to O
learning O
and O
studying O
trauma O
and O
parenting O
traumatized O
kids. O
As O
long O
as O
you O
take O
the O
time O
to O
really O
learn O
and O
research, O
it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
best O
things O
you O
have O
chosen O
to O
do O
in O
your O
life O
(although O
sometimes O
you O
may O
regret O
it O
and O
want O
to O
jump O
out O
the O
window O
- O
but O
that O
is O
just O
being O
a O
parent O
in O
general). O
The O
child O
you O
see O
in O
school O
is O
the O
child O
he O
is O
deep O
down, O
but O
there O
are O
going O
to O
be O
huge O
scary O
trauma O
behaviors O
that O
arise O
once O
he O
is O
placed O
in O
your O
home O
to O
test O
you O
and O
see O
if O
you O
will O
disrupt. O
These O
kids O
will O
do O
everything O
they O
can O
to O
try O
to O
push O
you O
away. O
If O
you O
prepare O
for O
it O
and O
dedicate O
yourself O
to O
**committing**, O
then O
you'll O
live O
and O
come O
out O
stronger O
for O
it, O
and O
it O
will O
save O
his O
literal O
physical O
and O
neurological O
development O
in O
ways O
that O
are O
profound. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
recommend O
reading O
some O
books. O
In O
fact, O
a O
lot O
of O
books. O
The O
more O
you O
read, O
the O
better O
off O
you'll O
be. O
There O
are O
also O
some O
great O
on O
demand O
DVDs O
by O
Karyn O
Purvis O
regarding O
TBRI. O
I O
find O
these O
to O
be O
incredible. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Be O
wary O
of O
Reddit O
and O
social O
media O
groups. O
Always O
remember O
that O
the O
type O
people O
who O
failed O
him O
initially O
are O
also O
members, O
and O
even O
though O
well-intended, O
do O
not O
have O
the O
skillset O
to O
heal O
but O
often O
end O
up O
profoundly O
breaking O
these O
kids. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Get O
therapy O
for O
yourself O
and O
for O
him O
right O
away. O
If O
you O
need O
a O
good O
virtual O
group O
with O
trainings, O
PM O
me. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
although O
I'm O
not O
too O
religious, O
God O
bless O
you O
for O
doing O
this O
for O
him. O
You O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
impact O
you O
can O
have. O
It O
is O
so O
profound. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
stepping O
up O
for O
this O
child. O
30 O
homes? O
That's O
atrocious O
and O
not O
normal. O
Definitely O
have O
a O
frank O
talk O
about O
this O
with O
the O
social O
worker. O
It O
may O
not O
be O
the O
child's O
fault O
at O
all O
but O
it's O
definitely O
something O
to O
carefully O
discuss. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you. O
I O
ordered O
the O
book. O
I O
know O
it O
will O
take O
time O
and O
gentle O
persistence O
to O
gain O
his O
trust, O
and O
I’m O
quiet O
and O
patient. O
It O
will O
come O
in O
time, O
I’m O
sure. O
It O
just O
has O
to O
be O
earned O
honestly. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you. O
I O
completely O
understand O
that O
the O
kid O
is O
blameless, O
and O
that O
a O
load O
of O
bad O
decisions O
by O
adults O
in O
his O
life O
have O
brought O
him O
here. O
I O
know O
we O
have O
a O
job O
ahead O
of O
us, O
but O
like O
anything O
worth O
doing, O
it’s O
worth O
doing O
it O
right. O
This O
isn’t O
about O
us, O
it’s O
about O

"The O

which O
is O
also O
commonly O

is O
going O
to O

up O

at O
some O

They're O
very O
similar O
books O
and O
the O
two O
authors O
worked O
in O
the O

labs, O
but O
one O
is O
aimed O
at O

the O

yourself O

up, O
then O
the O
battle O
is O
won. O
My O
advice O
too O
is O
to O
keep O
the O
bar O
extremely O
low. O
If O
he O
manages O
to O
walk O
in O
the O
house, O
consider O
that O
a O
win. O
If O
he O
says O
hello, O
act O
like O
it O
is O
a O
miracle O
that O
he O

Sad O
about O
my O
master's O
graduation O
[SEP]
I O
(30f) B-Age_Gender
am B-Education
graduating I-Education
next I-Education
week I-Education
from I-Education
my I-Education
Master's I-Education
program I-Education
for O
my O
dream O
career. O
I've O
been O
working O
hard O
since O
2019 O
in O
this O
program O
and O
I've O
done O
well O
even O
when O
switching O
to O
remote O
learning O
due O
to O
the O
pandemic. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My B-Relationship_Status
fiance I-Relationship_Status
(30m) B-Age_Gender
currently O
lives O
6 O
hours O
away O
for O
his O
doctoral O
program O
that O
he's O
dreamed O
of O
ever O
since O
I O
met O
him O
11 O
years O
ago. O
He O
unfortunately O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
attend O
because O
he O
has O
final O
exams O
the O
next O
day. O
I O
completely O
understand O
and O
I O
don't O
want O
him O
to O
do O
poorly O
on O
his O
final O
exams O
especially O
since O
he O
expressed O
concern O
that O
he O
hasn't O
been O
performing O
to O
his O
standards O
and O
may O
risk O
some O
need O
for O
remediation. O
I O
truly O
do O
not O
want O
him O
to O
risk O
his O
performance O
for O
his O
exam O
to O
travel O
to O
me O
for O
graduation O
and O
so O
forth. O
We O
both O
discussed O
that O
it O
is O
in O
both O
of O
our O
interests O
that O
he O
stay O
at O
school O
to O
prepare O
for O
his O
exams. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
the O
days O
come O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
graduation, O
I O
become O
more O
sad O
that O
he O
won't O
be O
there O
to O
share O
this O
monumental O
ceremony O
experience O
with O
me. O
I O
am O
saddened O
because O
he's O
been O
with O
me O
for O
the O
last O
11 O
years, O
proposed O
to O
me O
this O
year, O
and O
he's O
been O
there O
supporting O
me O
throughout O
my O
entire O
undergraduate O
and O
graduate O
career. O
I O
want O
to O
share O
this O
special O
moment O
with O
him O
and O
celebrate O
with O
him. O
I've O
done O
the O
same O
for O
him O
as O
he O
also O
started O
his O
doctoral O
program O
this O
year O
and O
supported O
him O
throughout. O
I'm O
extremely O
proud O
of O
him O
and O
want O
him O
to O
excel O
and O
exceed O
in O
his O
program. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
has O
expressed O
feeling O
guilty O
of O
not O
being O
able O
to O
make O
it. O
I've O
told O
him O
time O
and O
time O
again O
that O
though O
he O
may O
feel O
guilty, O
it's O
okay. O
Because O
even O
though O
I O
lie O
about O
being O
sad O
momentarily O
when O
I O
think O
about O
him O
not O
being O
there, O
I O
truthfully O
tell O
him O
that O
I O
am O
extremely O
happy O
he's O
in O
his O
dream O
program O
and O
that O
he O
will O
have O
the O
career O
he's O
been O
working O
so O
hard O
for O
for O
the O
past O
11 O
years. O
I O
truly O
don't O
want O
him O
to O
feel O
guilty O
because O
I O
sort O
of O
do O
think O
him O
not O
coming O
is O
an O
investment O
for O
his O
program O
to O
pass, O
not O
remediate, O
and O
get O
that O
degree. O
I O
was O
reminded O
throughout O
my O
master's O
program O
that O
committing O
to O
it O
and O
making O
sure O
I O
graduate O
costs O
us O
a O
short O
term O
sacrifice O
of O
not O
always O
being O
able O
to O
be O
there O
for O
your O
loved O
ones O
or O
for O
personal O
enjoyment, O
for O
long O
term O
payout O
(hopefully). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
do O
plan O
on O
spending O
much O
much O
more O
time O
with O
him O
after O
I O
graduate O
and O
travel O
with O
my O
family O
internationally O
for O
the O
holidays O
(he O
is O
not O
joining O
due O
to O
the O
14 O
hour O
flights O
to O
and O
from, O
16 O
hour O
time O
difference, O
and O
about O
only O
a O
1.5-2 O
week O
break). O
So O
the O
distance O
is O
not O
an O
issue, O
it's O
just O
that O
I'm O
sad O
he O
won't O
be O
at O
graduation. O
Plus, O
I O
will O
be O
his O
study O
buddy O
again O
once O
I'm O
back O
since O
I O
have O
to O
study O
for O
board O
exams. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
the O
sadness O
just O
revolves O
around O
wanting O
to O
have O
my O
person O
be O
there O
with O
me O
to O
see O
me O
graduate. O
To O
take O
pictures O
for O
memories O
that O
we O
both O
did O
this O
together, O
celebrate O
together O
with O
family O
afterwards O
at O
my O
favorite O
restaurant, O
and O
just O
have O
a O
final O
deep O
breath O
of O
relief O
with O
my O
fiance O
and O
family O
that O
I O
actually O
completed O
my O
program. O
I O
want O
to O
have O
every O
monumental O
accomplishments O
and O
experiences O
shared O
with O
him. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
this O
off O
my O
chest O
because O
I O
sometimes O
feel O
like O
a O
burden O
when O
I O
have O
the O
need O
to O
cry O
or O
express O
my O
sadness O
when O
it O
comes O
around. O
Just O
needed O
to O
vent O
and O
express. O
Thank O
you O
for O
reading. O
[SEP]
trivial O
in O
the O
grand O
scheme. O
ten O
years O
from O
now O
you'll O
look O
back O
at O
this O
and O
wonder O
what O
you O
were O
thinking, O
stressing O
out O
about O
this. O
just O
enjoy O
and O
set O
up O
your O
plans O
for O

when O

[SEP]
I O
was O
absent O
at O
my O
own O
Masters O
graduation, O
and O
my O
husband O
was O
absent O
at O
his O
PhD O
graduation. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
got O
our O
diplomas O
in O

Once, O
my O
diploma O
was O
laying O
around O
and O
I O
used O
it O
as O
a O

while O
I O
was O
sweeping O
the O
floor. O
[SEP]
Congratulations! O
Could O
he O
watch O
the O
ceremony O
via O
FaceTime O
or O
something? O
You O
both O
sound O
like O
awesome O
people O
who O
have O
accomplished O
so O
much O
and O
unfortunately O
as O
you O
well O
know O
it O
involves O
some O
compromises. O
Better O
than O
nothing. O
[SEP]
My O
parents O
skipped O
out O
on O
mine O
because O
they O
didn’t O
feel O

driving. O
At O

he O
has O
a O
good O
reason. O
The O
hurt O
is O
real O
though. O
This O
internet O
stranger O
is O
proud O
of O
you! O
Congratulations O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
We're O
both O
proud O
of O
our O
accomplishments O
we've O
both O
gotten O
to O
and O
I O
will O
thank O
you O
on O
his O
behalf O
for O
him O
getting O
to O
his. O
We O
both O
know O
the O
compromises O
suck O
but O
GAH! O
We O
will O
definitely O
be O
fine O
[SEP]
[SEP]
What's O
great O
is O
that O
the O
event O
is O
going O
to O
be O
live O
streamed. O
He O
will O
definitely O
be O
watching O
if O
he's O
not O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
exam. O
[SEP]
I'm O
so O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
about O
your O
graduation. O
My O
friend O
is O
having O
the O
same O
situation O
with O
her O
parents O
not O
initially O
wanting O
to O
attend O
due O
to O
driving O
and O
eventually O
convinced O
them O
to O
go. O
Thank O
you O
for O
understanding O
the O
sadness O
around O
this. O
Thank O
you O
so O
much! O

[SEP]

My O
suggestion O
is O
to O
clearly O
state, O
in O

to O
your O
superior, O
that O
your O
religion O
requires O
you O
to O
attend O
a O
worship O
service O
on O
December O
8th O
and O
your O
scheduled O

the O
worship O
service O
you O
will O
be O
attending. O
Most O
likely O
they O
will O
do O
nothing, O
but O
if O
they O
do O
you O
have O
etablished O
evidence O
for O
a O
religious O
discrimination O
claim. O

Any O
chance O
of O

it O

It's O

that O

they O
still O
don't O
get O
the O

off O
for O

If O
I O
were O

first O
reiterate O

be O
unavailable O
that O
day, O

if O
the O
boss O
refused O
to O
change O
it, O
I O
would O
just O
give O
the O
boss O
an O
ultimatum: O
either O
take O
me O
off O
the O
schedule O
or O
I O
quit. O

I O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
this O
when O

Tell O

you O
are O
protected O
under O
the O
law O
by O
Title O
7 O
of O
EEOA. O
Once O
they O
understood O
this, O
they O
started O
whistling O
a O

tune O

went O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
keep O
me O
away O
from O
stuff O
involving O
the O
offensive. O
These O
laws O
are O
for O

can O

can. O

go O

Well O
I O
work O

any O
past O
8pm O
at O

I O
could O

don’t O

my O

she O

[SEP]
So O
you O
can't O
get O
to O
a O
Mass O
during O
the O
day? O
I O
realize O
that O
you O
said O
you're O
a O
student. O
[SEP]
I O
assumed O
they O
had O
already O
done O
that. O
[SEP]
> O
can O
I O
actually O
hire O
a O
lawyer? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can...but O
you O
can O
likely O
kiss O
the O
job O
goodbye O
and O
it'll O
cost O
you O
a O
lot O

money. O
[SEP]
Leaving O
school O
for O
a O
couple O
hours O
is O
illegal? O
I O
don't O
know O
this O
person O
to O
be O
a O
minor, O
and O
even O
if O
they O
are, O
I O
don't O
know O
of O
anywhere O
that O
a O
parent O
can't O
pull O
a O
student O
out O
of O
school O
for O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time. O
Hell, O
we O
routinely O
pull O
kids O
out O
for O
a O
week O
at O
a O
time O
to O
go O
deer O
hunting. O
[SEP]
I O
can’t O
unless O
I O
skipped O
school O
[SEP]
It’s O
illegal O
for O
a O
business O
to O
have O
a O
high O
school O
kid O
come O
to O
work O
during O
his O
class O
time. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
OP O
is O
clearly O
some O
high O
schooler. O
[SEP]
Well O
it O
depends O
on O
what O
would O
be O
the O
worse O
consequences.... O
missing O
a O
class O
or O
two, O
or O
possibly O
losing O
your O
job. O
🤷🏼‍♂️ O
[SEP]
I O
didn’t O
suggest O
having O
anyone O
leave O
school O
to O
go O
to O
work. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
said, O
when O
I O
was O
a O
senior O
in O
highschool O
I O
went O
to O
school O
for O
half O
of O
a O
day O
and O
worked O
half O
a O
day O
so O
it O
isn’t O
illegal O
here. O
I O
had O
all O
the O
credits O
I O
needed O
by O
then O
though. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
aren’t O
in O
school O
at O
the O
time O
then O
it’s O
legal, O
but O
an O
employer O
cannot O
be O
having O
student O
workers O
sipping O
to O
work. O
OP O
seems O
imply O
they O
are O
in O
class. O
[SEP]
Nobody O
suggested O
that O
the O
employer O
would O
be O
having O
the O
student O
miss O
class O
to O
work. O
I O
suggested O
they O
miss O
class O
to O
attend O
Mass. O

Hi O
there, O
not O
sure O
if O
anyone O
can O
help O
me O
with O
this O
but O
I’m O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
my O
layover O
time O
for O
an O
upcoming O
AC O
flight. O
In O
mid O
January O
I’m B-Location
flying I-Location
from I-Location
Halifax I-Location
to I-Location
New I-Location
York I-Location
through I-Location
Montreal. I-Location
The O
first O
flight O
gets O
into O
YUL O
at O
around O
7:40am. O
It’s O
then O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
layover O
before O
the O
flight O
to O
New O
York. O
Am O
I O
going O
to O
be O
screwed O
for O
getting O
through O
customs? O
I O
know O
technically O
the O
airline O
wouldn’t O
offer O
the O
trip O
if O
it O
wasn’t O
enough O
time O
but O
I O
haven’t O
flown O
internationally O
since O
long O
before O
COVID O
so O
I’m O
panicking O
a O
little. O
I’m O
not O
checking O
any O
bags O
which O
I O
think O
helps O
my O
case. O
I’m O
also O
travelling O
alone O
if O
that O
makes O
a O
difference. O
If O
anyone O
has O
any O
insight O
on O
whether O
I O
should O
look O
into O
changing O
my O
flight O
please O
let O
me O
know! O
[SEP]
There O
are O
flights O
from O
Montréal O
to O
NYC O
almost O
every O
hour O
in O
the O
morning. O
If O
you O
do O
miss O
the O
connection, O
AC O
will O
just O
put O
you O
in O
the O
next O
flight. O
The O
caveat O
is O
which O
NYC O
airport O
you O
will O
be O
put O
on O
to. O
[SEP]
It O
will O
be O
tight O
that O
time O
of O
the O
morning, O
but O
they O
pulled O
ppl O
from O
the O
connections O
line O
through O
customs O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
in O
a O
long O
line O
so O
you O
should O
be O
fine. O
Not O
having O
a O
checked O
bag O
will O
save O
you O
hours O
and O
hours O
if O
you O
were O
to O
misconnect. O
[SEP]
Should O
be O
fine. O
Last O
time O
I O
did O
transborder O
in O
YUL O
was O
in O
October O
and O
the O
luggage O
was O
the O
slow O
bit O
at O
US O
customs O
so O
if O
you O
can O
avoid O
checking O
a O
bag O
that O
will O
help. O
But O
as O
long O
as O
your O
departure O
is O
on O
time O
it O
should O
be O
fine. O
As O
someone O
else O
mentioned, O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
other O
daily O
flights O
so O
worst O
case O
is O
you O
get O
rebooked O
a O
few O

One O
thing O
to O

that O

permanent. O
I O
wasn’t O
a O
candidate O
for O
a O

my O

said O
I O
can O
get O
implants O
right O
now O
and O
then O
get O
them O
removed O
and O
do O
a O
flap O
procedure O
in O
the O
future. O
It O
will O
end O
up O
being O
extra O
surgeries O
down O
the O
line, O

it O
might O
be O
worth O
it O

you O

get O
it O
over O

I O

the O
nipple O
reconstruction O
as O
part O
of O
the O
DIEP O
recommendation O
but O
eagerly O
opted O
to O
pass. O
I O
spent O
my O
entire O
life O
trying O
to O
hide O
my O
very O
temperature O
responsive O
nipples O
and O
was O
happy O
to O
never O
have O
to O
think O
about O
that O
again. O
I O
haven't O
yet O
decided O
what O
to O
do O
about O
nipples, O
I'm O
going O
the O
tattoo O
route O
but O
haven't O
decided O
if O
I'm O
going O
to O
get O
a O
regular O
nipple O
or O
go O
for O
something O
more O
creative. O
There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
beautiful O
images O
if O
you O
search O
for O
mastectomy O
tattoos. O

I'm O
sorry O
that O
you're O
facing O
such O
a O
hard O
situation. O
It O
sucks. O
As O
others O
have O
said, O
you O
are O
not O
your O
boobs, O
you O
are O
a O
person O
with O
boobs O
that O
needs O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
before O
they O
kill O
you. O
It O
feels O
like O
a O
betrayal, O
but O
it O
gets O
easier O
over O
time. O
You O
are O
taking O
control O
of O
your O
life O
and O
that O
matters O
more O
than O
any O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
it. O

tough O
no O
way O
around O
it O
so O
you O
have O
to O
go O
thru O
it. O
But O
for O
me O
I O
was O
going O
to O
be O
in O
charge. O
I O
wasn’t O
going O
to O
be O
pushed, O
even O
though O
the O
doctors O
tried. O
I O
prayed O
about O
what O
to O
do O
and O
decided O
it O
was O
my O
body O
and O
I O
was O
going O
to O
work O
thru O
this. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
why O
they O
remove O
other O
female O
organs. O
There O
was O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
me O
but O
one O
breast O
and O
the O
cancer O
had O
gone O
to O
stage O
four O
and O
was O
in O
my O
back, O
abdomen, O
liver O
and O
right O
knee. O

but O
I O
pray O
that O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
stop O
and O
work O
thru O
this. O
I O
changed O
my O
diet, O
took O
one O
small O
chemo O
pill O
(doctor O
insisted O
that O
if O
she O
was O
going O
to O
treat O
me O
and O
help O
me O
to O
monitor O
my O
progress). O
It O
has O
been O
five O
years. O
I O
had O
four O
years O
of O
progress O
and O
the O
fifth O
year O
my O
immune O
system O
was O
weakened O
and O
the O
cancer O
went O
up O
on O
me. O
But O
I O
focused O
on O
being O
grateful, O
eating O
and O
exercising O
and O
low O
stress, O
as O
much O
as O
possible. O
I O
take O
a O

keep O

One O
thing O
that O
worked O
for O
me O
and O
I O
have O
seen O
work O
for O

was O
that O
I O
didn’t O
let O
cancer O
define O
me. O
I O
am O
a O
person O
first, O
with O
a O
life O
and O
I O
refused O
to O
let O
the O
cancer O
overtake O
me. O
I O
am O
thankful O
for O
each O

I O
am O

I O
accept O
each O

what O
each O

will O
not O
live O
with O
the O

myself O

Hi. O
I O
had O
the O
same O
thing O
and O
opted O
for O
DCIS O
instead O
of O
implants. O
Just O
a O
thought O
[SEP]
I O
also O
had O
a O
nipple O
and O
skin O
sparing O
mastectomy. O
I'm O
shocked O
how O
normal O
my O
reconstructed O
breasts O
look. O
The O
only O
incision O
is O
along O
the O
breast O
crease. O
[SEP]
I O
will O
ask. O
I O
know O
my O
oncologist O
is O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
keeping O
it O
because O
the O
cancer O
is O
there. O
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
tip. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
so O
much. O
I O
appreciate O
the O
support O
and O
kind O
words. O
We O
don’t O
have O
many O
choices O
except O
to O
save O
our O
lives. O
[SEP]
I O
want O
to O
eventually O
replace O
the O
implants O
with O
my O
own O
tissue. O
My O
first O
objective O
is O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
cancer O
first. O
Thank O
you O
for O
your O
lovely O
words. O
[SEP]
I’m O
sorry O
you O
had O
to O
go O
through O
this O

you O

36 I-Age
this B-Time

It’s O
so O
hard O
to O
accept O
all O
these O
massive O
changes. O
I O
hope O
you’re O
doing O
okay. O
BRCA2 O
is O
evil. O
I O
wish O
you O
all O
the O

with O
your O

Thanks! O
I O
am O
doing O
pretty O
well O
I O
think! O
I O
get O
so O
anxious O
as O
my O

get O
closer. O
It's O
hard O
not O
knowing O
what O
to O
expect! O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
read O
through O

less O

I O
feel O
fortunate O
that O

What O
did O
you O
mean O
to O
type O
instead O
of O
DCIS? O
DIEP O
maybe? O
[SEP]
Same! O
I O
had O
resigned O
myself O
to O
awful O
scars, O
but O
maybe O
they O
would O
look O
cool? O
Like O
war O
wounds? O
A O
car O
accident O
but O
I O
survived? O
Or O
maybe O
they O
wouldn’t O
be O
awful, O
but O
surely O
my O
breasts O
would O
never O
look O
good. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
When O
the O
scabs O
fell O
off O
from O
nipples O
(it O
took O
*ages* O
on O
one O
breast) O
I O
was O
stunned O
how O
good O
they O
looked. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
guess O
they O
will O
redo O
the O
incision O
edges O
when O
I O
have O
the O
spacers O
removed O
and O
the O
implants O
placed, O
and O
*then* O
they’ll O
be O
careful O
about O
the O
scars. O
Silicone O
coverings O
and O
such. O
I O
blurted O
out: O
“these O
the O
“bad” O
scars?!?” O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
scars O
are O
very O
thin, O
and O
only O
slightly O
red O
(which O
will O
fade). O
Where O
it O
is O
red, O
it O
perfectly O
matches O
the O
areola. O
They’re O
perky O
and O
even. O
I O
love O
them, O
and O
they O
aren’t O
even O
in O
their O
final O
form. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
hope O
this O
helps. O
I O
was O
vain O
about O
my O
nipples O
(it’s O
not O
good O
to O
be O
vain, O
but O
I O
was) O
and O
so O
I O
was O
scared O
how O
things O
would O
look. O
I O
hope O
my O
(anecdotal) O
data O
helps O
someone. O
[SEP]
It’s O
easy O
for O
me O
to O
say O
because O
I O
was O
lucky O
enough O
to O
keep O
both O
nipples, O
but O
looking O
at O
pictures O
of O
my O
PS’s O
work, O
I O
was O
shocked O
how O
good O
the O
“constructed” O
nipples O
looked. O
Then O
I O
assumed, O
oh, O
they O
look O
good O
now O
but O
will O
deteriorate O
or O
shrink O
or O
something O
in O
5 O
years. O
But O
her O
PA O
(who O
I O
trust O
perhaps O
most O
of O
all O
my O
cancer O
medical O
people) O
said O
that O
rarely O
happens. O
Anyway, O
this O
made O
me O
less O
scared O
at O
the O
potential O
mine O
would O
die O
or O
need O
to O
be O
removed. O
I O
mean, O
they O
looked O
*good*. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
haven’t O
seen O
pictures O
of O
3D O
tattoos, O
but O
from O
other O
people O
commenting, O
these O
can O
look O
great O
too. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Wishing O
a O
successful O
outcome O
for O
you, O
both O
cancer-wise O
and O
looks-wise. O
[SEP]
Lol... O
yep O
DIEP... O
darn O
autocorrect. O
[SEP]
I O
felt O
the O
same O
way! O
I O
refused O
to O
look O
at O
them O
after O
the O
mastectomy O
and O
tissue O
expander O
placement O
until O
my O
mom O
told O
me O
she O
was O
impressed O
at O
an O
appointment O
with O
the O
surgeon. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
did O
follow O
up O
with O
a O
PAP O
flap O
reconstruction O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
which O
came O
with O
a O
startling O
number O
of O
incisions. O
Everything O
is O
healing O
really O
well O
and O
I'm O
thrilled O
with O
the O
results. O
I O
will O
have O
some O
scars O
but O
nothing O
as O
disfiguring O
as O
I O
envisioned O
in O
my O
mind. O
My O
surgeon O
cut O
through O
a O
tattoo O
on O
the O
front O
of O
my O
hip O
and O
you O
can't O
even O
tell O
at O
3 O
weeks O
out. O
It's O
incredible. O
I O
am O
already O
much O
more O
comfortable O
in O
my O
skin O
that O
I O
anticipated O
at O
this O
stage. O
Now O
if O
only O
my O
hair O
could O
grow O
back O
faster! O

Very O

[SEP]
[SEP]
That O

it’s O
benefitting O
[SEP]
There's O
been O
many O

that O
human's O
frontal O
lobes, O

where O
we O
logically O
weigh O
risks O
and O
think O
of O
the O
future, O
don't O
fully O
develop O
until O
our O
early O

On O
top O
of O
that, O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
fantasy O

support O
for O
anyone O
that O
likes O
to O
deviate O
from O

no O

even O

Very O
recently O
I O
went O
to O
a O
public O
concert O
where O
another O
attendee O
showed O
up O
in O
a O
head O
to O
toe O
anthropomorphic O
furry O
outfit. O
My O
spouse's O
immediate O
reaction O
was O
to O
exhale O
and O
say, O
"Well O
I O
don't O
think O
anyone O
will O
be O
looking O
too O
closely O
at O
*me* O
tonight." O
We O
came O
to O
learn O
later O
that O
night O
that O
he O
now O
lives O
full O
time O
as O
his O
"fursona", O
using O
only O
his O
fursona O
name. O
He's O
married, O
works O
from O
home O
full O
time O
in O
IT, O
and O
his O
spouse O
was O
with O
him. O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
his O
spouse O
supports O
him, O
but O
she O
honestly O
looked O
pretty O
uncomfortable O
and O
resigned O
anytime O
I O
dared O
to O
look. O
No O
way O
to O
know O
how O
old O
he O
was, O
but O
it O
had O
to O
be O
late O
20's O
early O
30's O
if O
it O
matched O
the O
age O
of O
his O
wife. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Certainly O
gave O
me O
a O
lot O
to O
think O
about O
since O
then... O
I O
imagine O
that O
was O
an O
interesting O
conversation O
to O
have O
with O
his O
immediate O
family. O
Sort O
of O
puts O
a O
lot O
of O
perspective O
on O
"coming O
out, O
being O
brave, O
living O
your O
truth." O
My O
spouse, O
for O
all O
their O
journey's, O
didn't O
seem O
very O
supportive. O
I O
still O
don't O
know O
how O
I O
feel, O
other O
than... O
sympathy. O
I'm O
afraid O
to O
look O
into O
it O
more O
too, O
lest O
the O
algorithms O
take O
my O
curiosity O
for O
earnest O
interest. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
will O
say, O
from O
what O
I O
have O
observed, O
is O
that O
*a O
lot* O
of O
young O
people O
simply O
consider O
transitioning O
"an O
option" O
versus O
an O
affirmation; O
and O
often O
with O
the O
argument O
that, O
"people O
should O
just O
be O
allowed O
to O
do O
what O
they O
want, O
it's O
not O
hurting O
anyone O
right?" O
[SEP]
I O
know, O
this O
shit O
makes O
me O
so O
anxious O
for O
everyone. O
Younger O
and O
older. O
This O
shit O
is O
serious O

life O
changing O

no, O
let's O
get O
riskyyyyy🎉 O

Like O
most O
things O
today O
unfortunately. O
Look O
at O
covid O
imo O
it O
should O
have O
never O
been O
a O
political O
thing O
and O
only O
a O
100% O
scientific O
thing. O
I O
hate O
the O
current O
state O
of O
politics O
[SEP]
That O
worries O
me O
too. O
My O
spouse O
is O
intersex O
and O
after O
going O
back O
and O
forth, O
being O
on O
both O
E O
and O
T O
trying O
to O
figure O
themselves O
out, O
they O
now O
consider O
themselves O
nonbinary. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
recently O
read O
that O
as O
many O
as O
2% O
of O
people O
are O
intersex, O
about O
the O
same O
rate O
as O
people O
with O
red O
hair. O
So O
if O
you've O
met O
someone O
with O
red O
hair, O
you've O
probably O
met O
someone O
who O
is O
intersex. O
In O
addition O
to O
my O
spouse O
I O
currently O
know O
a O
woman O
who O
is O
quite O
tall, O
grows O
a O
full O
beard O
(has O
an O
obvious O
five O
o'clock O
shadow O
otherwise), O
and O
visually O
doesn't O
pass O
for O
female O
very O
well. O
But, O
she O
IS O
female, O
genuinely O
FAB, O
and O
has O
had O
children. O
I O
don't O
remember O
the O
specifics O
are O
for O
her O
medical O
diagnosis, O
but O
her O
existence O
has O
been O
a O
valuable O
lesson O
to O
concepts O
held O
by O
others. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Many O
people O
I O
know O
believe O
as O
I O
do, O
that O
it's O
entirely O
natural O
to O
be O
homosexual O
(or O
bisexual O
within O
a O
spectrum O
of O
homo O
and O
hetero). O
But O
many O
people O
think O
there O
is O
only O
male O
or O
female, O
and O
scientifically O
I O
know O
that O
there's O
a O
hell O
of O
a O
lot O
more O
variables O
regarding O
sex. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
After O
a O
lot O
of O
study O
(and O
I'm O
talking O
20+ O
years O
here) O
I'm O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
true O
transexuals O
do O
exist O
and O
are O
inherently O
intersex, O
and O
that O
depending O
on O
the O
medical O
diagnosis O
there's O
a O
spectrum O
there O
too, O
but O
the O
peer O
science O
is O
lacking. O
And O
that O
spectrum O
can O
change-- O
there O
was O
a O
case O
of O
an O
intersex O
man O
with O
Klinefelter's O
whom O
after O
an O
illness O
their O
adrenals O
reset O
and O
their O
body O
went O
with O
the O
XX O
instead O
of O
the O
XY O
of O
their O
natural O
XXY O
state. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Thus, O
he O
grew O
breasts O
and O
his O
body O
began O
naturally O
feminizing. O
Having O
always O
felt O
female O
privately, O
once O
their O
body O
changed, O
that O
person O
chose O
to O
transition. O
Whether O
or O
not O
they O
got O
bottom O
surgery O
I O
don't O
know, O
but O
they O
were O
effectively O
a O
woman O
with O
working O
male O
sex O
organs O
otherwise. O
Again, O
it O
bothers O
me O
greatly O
when O
people O
argue O
that O
intersex O
people O
still O
must O
be O
one O
or O
the O
other, O
like O
there O
can't O
somehow O
be O
a O
spectrum O
there O
too. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
helpful O
if O
genetic O
and O
medical O
testing O
were O
stardard O
as O
part O
of O
transitioning, O
including O
endocrine O
testing O
and O
mapped O
neurology O
via O
MRI, O
but O
that O
would O
call O
into O
question O
that O
there's O
more O
to O
it O
than O
belief O
or O
that O
people O
should O
simply O
be O
free O
to O
do O
as O
they O
wish. O
This O
is O
further O
exacerbated O
in O
places O
like O
the O
USA O
where O
transitioning O
has O
become O
somewhat O
common O
but O
otherwise O
medicine O
in O
general O
is O
pretty O
abysmal. O
[SEP]
The O
people O
acting O
out O
their O
hentai O
feminization O
fantasies, O
and O
the O
doctors O
making O
money O
off O
it. O
[SEP]
To O
the O
question-- O
so O
are O
they O
in O
their O
fursuit O
now O
24-7? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
assume O
the O
answer O
is O
mostly? O
Logically O
I'm O
pretty O
sure O
they O
don't O
shower O
in O
it. O
We O
went O
to O
the O
concert O
with O
several O
friends. O
One O
of O
my O
friends O
had O
a O
panic O
attack O
so O
security O
took O
them O
out O
of O
the O
venue O
for O
a O
bit, O
another O
friend O
went O
with O
them O
as O
a O
support O
person O
and O
they O
were O
taken O
to O
a O
quieter O
area O
to O
get O
some O
air. O
The O
person O
in O
their O
fursuit O
and O
his O
wife O
was O
also O
there, O
because O
being O
around O
so O
many O
people O
in O
the O
fursuit O
they O
kept O
overheating. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
friend O
who O
was O
the O
support O
person O
is O
utterly O
fearless O
and O
didn't O
waste O
the O
opportunity O
to O
chat O
them O
up, O
which O
is O
how O
we O
found O
out O
they're O
living O
full-time O
as O
their O
fursona O
now. O
They O
can O
eat O
in O
it, O
but O
my O
friend O
didn't O
inquire O
about O
other... O
functions. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
On O
the O
drive O
home O
that O
night O
my O
spouse O
remarked O
that O
if O
they're O
in O
it O
full O
time O
and O
they're O
overheating O
then O
it O
must O
get O
pretty O
sweaty O
and O
smelly O
and O
they O
must O
have O
to O
get O
it O
dry O
cleaned. O
They O
must O
have O
multiple O
sets O
of O
the O
suit O
too. O
It O
was O
a O
clearly O
custom-made O
high O
quality O
fursuit, O
I O
can't O
imagine O
it's O
having O
been O
inexpensive. O
Getting O
multiple O
made O
at O
the O
same O
time O
probably O
would O
have O
been O
somewhat O
cost-effective? O

I O

My B-Family

be I-Family
very I-Family
loving I-Family

something I-Family
i I-Family

no I-Family
one I-Family

my I-Family

let’s I-Family
others I-Family

there I-Family

This O

the O

My O
mom O
decided O
to O
open O
a O
small O
business. O
This O
is O
great O
and O
I’ll O
always O
support O
her! O
However, O
I O
was O
ALWAYS O
at O
said O
business. O
I O
rarely O
got O
to O
just O
be O
at O
home. O
I O
had O
bad O
separation O
anxiety, O
too, O
so O
I O
never O
wanted O
to O
go O
hang O
out O
with O
friends. O
I O
would O
be O
put O
to O
work O
and/or O
told O
to O
go O
into O
my O
mom’s O
“office”. O
I O
was O
expected O
to O
occupy O
myself, O
every O
single O
day O
after O
school, O
for O
hours O
on O
end. O
It O
was O
frustrating O
and O
I O
remember O
being O
upset O
about O
it O
when O
I O
was O
a O
child. O
It O
still O
upsets O
me O

Around O
this O
time, O
I B-Mental_Health
began I-Mental_Health
showing I-Mental_Health
signs I-Mental_Health
of I-Mental_Health
depression I-Mental_Health
and I-Mental_Health
anxiety. I-Mental_Health
I O
was O
formally O
diagnosed O
and O
my O
mom O
was O
very O
supportive O
of O
getting O
me O
help O
(getting O
me O
into O
the O
doctor, O
encouraging O
medication, O
etc.)! O
I O
started O
missing O
a O
lot O
of O
school O
during O
this O
time O
due O
to O
my O
mental O
health. O
My O
parents O
and O
I O
fought O
nearly O
every O
single O
day O
because O
I O
wouldn’t O
want O
to O
go O
to O
school. O
One O
night, O
after O
my O
parents O
and O
I O
had O
finished O
arguing O
about O
it, O
I O
overheard O
them O
talking O
about O
me. O
Being O
a O
nosy O
little O
shit, O
I O
eavesdropped O
and O
heard O
my O
dad O
say O
that O
my O
mental O
illnesses O
were O
not O
real O
(he O
has O
a O
minor O
in O
psych. O
So, O
understandably, O
this O
made O
me O
doubt O
myself O
a O
LOT). O

One O
night, O
while O
out O
to O
dinner O
with O
my O
parents, O
we O
had O
gotten O
into O
a O
small O
argument. O
I O
can’t O
remember O
what O
it O
was O
about, O
but O
I O
remember O
that O
I O
told O
them O
I O
was O
“going O
to O
run O
away O
and O
kill O
myself”. O
My O
dad O
hit O
me O
in O
the O
face O
for O
that. O

By O
the O
time O
I O
was O
around O
14-15, O
I O
was O
sick O
of O
being O
forced O
to O
go O
to O
work O
with O
my O
mom O
at O
her O
small O
business O
(also, O
at O
this O
point O
in O
time, O
I O
had O
transferred O
to O
an O
online O
school O
due O
to O
mental O
&amp; O
physical O
health O
reasons). O
So, O
I O
would O
ask O
to O
stay O
home O
instead. O
My O
mom O
usually O
let O
me O
stay O
home O
every O
single O
time O
that O
I O
asked. O
I O
would O
typically O
be O
home O
alone O
from O
10am-8pm O
during O
this O
time. O
My B-Family
parents I-Family
worked I-Family
a I-Family

so I-Family
I I-Family
barely I-Family
saw I-Family
them. I-Family
One O

I O
even O
stayed O
home O
alone O
all O
day O
on O
my O
birthday O
(I O
think O
I O
was O
turning O
15 O
or O
16). O
Yes, O
I O
did O
ask O
to O
stay O
home. O
However, O
I O
really O
feel O
like O
they O
could’ve O
made O
an O
effort O
to O
not O
neglect O
(?) O
me O
completely. O

My O
dad O
and O
I O
were O
in O
the O
car O
together O
one O
day O
(I O
was O
driving) O
when O
we O
drove O
past O
a O
slew O
of O
protesters O
in O
our O
city. O
He O
asked O
what O
they O
were O
protesting, O
and O
I O
told O
him O
that O
they O
were O
“pro-lifers” O
protesting O
on O
the O
opposite O
street O
of O
a O
non-profit O
women’s O
clinic O
(this O
clinic O
offers O
free O
pregnancy O
tests, O
ultrasounds, O
and O
doesn’t O
even O
perform O
abortions O
nor O
refers O
patients). O
My B-Family
dad, I-Family
being I-Family
a I-Family
pro-lifer, I-Family
began I-Family
going I-Family
on I-Family
a I-Family
tangent I-Family
about I-Family
being I-Family
pro-life I-Family
and I-Family
why I-Family
abortion I-Family
was I-Family
morally I-Family
wrong. I-Family
Me, B-Stance
being I-Stance
pro-choice, I-Stance
naturally O
began O
debating O
him. O
When O
things O
got O
too O
heated, O
I O
politely O
asked O
him O
to O
stop O
because O
I O
was O
getting O
angry O
and O
wanted O
to O
drop O
it. O
He O
kept O
going, O
and O
I O
kept O
asking O
him O
to O
stop. O
Finally, O
I O
snapped O
and O
began O
yelling O
at O
him O
(which O
I O
knew O
would O
happen). O
He O
told O
me O
to O
“pull O
the O
fucking O
car O
over” O
and O
that O
he O
would O
“walk O
home”. O
He O
got O
out O
of O
the O
car, O
I O
asked O
him O
to O
get O
back O
in, O
and O
he O
refused. O
So, O
I O
drove O
home O
without O
him. O
I O
was O
home O
with O
my O
mom O
(who O
was O
trying O
to O
calm O
me O
down) O
for O
about O
30-40 O
minutes. O
My O
dad O
finally O
walks O
in, O
slams O
the O
door, O

starts O
yelling O
at O
me O
for O

hey O
friend, O
sorry O
you're O
going O
through O
this. O
feeling O
angry O

grieving O
is O
natural O

healthy O
as O
a O
reaction O
to O
what O
you've O
been O
through. O
I O
will O
say O
that O
it's O
going O
to O
be O
much O
harder O
for O
you O
to O
create O
a O
space O
of O
healing O
and O
change O
while O
still O
living O
with O
her, O
but O
it's O
possible O
to O
start. O
first, O
try O
writing O
her O
a O
letter O
with O
all O
the O
things O
you O
want O
to O
say, O
and O
then O
-this O
is O
critical- O
burn O
the O
letter. O
your O
mother O
is O
not O
emotionally O
mature O
or O
capable O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
give O
you O
the O
closure O
you O
need O
and O
to O
meet O
you O
on O
the O
level O
you O
need O
from O
her, O
and O
I'm O
sorry O
about O
that. O
It's O
a O
hard O
thing O
to O
hear O
and O
harder O
still O
to O
accept, O
but O
that O
is O
part O
of O
the O
process. O
Confronting O
your O
mother O
won't O
help O
you O
right O
now, O
and O
may O
make O
you O
more O

I O

you're O

very O
likely O
something O
coming O
from O
the O
network O
is O
triggering O
a O
firewall/IDS O
rule O
on O
Hetzner O
server/network O
that's O
triggering O
this O
lock O
out O
behavior. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It's O
probably O
easiest O
to O
ask O
Hetzner O
about O
it, O
but O
if O
they O
are O
uncooperative O
then O
you'll O
have O
to O
watch O
your O
outgoing O
traffic O
with O
some O
sort O
of O
tool O
and O
hope O
you O
can O
find O
something. O
Presumably O
the O

is O
encrypted, O
so O
this O
could O
get O
difficult. O

The O
plan O
they O
have O

a O
very O
basic O
hosting O
plan. O
Essentially O
Hetzner O
said O
'you O
configured O
the O
server/firewall/wordpress O
stuff, O
we O
just O
provide O
the O
VM O
these O
run O
on, O
so O
you O
are O
responsible O
for O
making O
sure O
it O
works O
right, O
we O
can't O
assist O
in O
this'. O
[SEP]
Okay, O
yeah, O
the O
guy O
that O
set O
it O
up O
is O
the O
only O
one O
that O
knows O
what O
he O
did. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
guess O
you O
could O
have O
another O
expert O
look O
at O
what's O
configured, O
but O
this O
isn't O
some O
easy O
thing O
to O
figure O
out. O
I O
can O
think O
of O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
that O
could O
cause O
this. O
From O
Wordpress O
plugins O
to O
IDSes, O
Apache O
modules, O
etc. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
One O
very O
quick O
workaround O
you O
could O
try O
is O
reconfiguring O
the O
firewall O
with O
an O
ACCEPT O
rule O
for O
the O
Office O
IP O
as O
the O
first O
rule. O
That O
way O
any O
later O
rules O
made O
by O
some O
sort O
of O
solution O
can't O
block O
the O

a O

of O
a O

i’ll O
try O
to O

as O
concise O
as O
i O
can O
be O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
a O
28 B-Age
y.o. I-Age
guy B-Gender
and O
the B-Relationship_Status
girl I-Relationship_Status
i I-Relationship_Status
dated I-Relationship_Status
till I-Relationship_Status
recently I-Relationship_Status
is B-Age
23. I-Age
I O
met O
her O
4 O
months O
ago O
and O
since O
then O
we’ve O
been O
together, O
and O
our O
relationship O
was O
so O
nice, O
without O
any O
arguments, O
or O
fights O
or O
anything. O
We O
understood O
eachother O
at O
a O
deeper O
level. O
We O
did O
all O
things O
together O
(e.g O
cooking, O
cleaning, O
etc.). O
About O
a O
week O
ago O
or O
so, O
she O
said O
she O
needs O
time O
for O
her O
to O
solve O
her O
personal O
issue, O
and O
she O
said O
that O
she O
can’t O
do O
that O
while O
being O
with O
me O
because O
she O
doesn’t O
want O
to O
hurt O
me O
with O
her O
behaviour/ O
problems. O
She’s O
going O
to O
go O
through O
a O
dermatological O
intervention, O
she’ll O
have O
a O
5 O
week O
exam O
session O
and O
has O
to O
write O
her O
bachelor’s O
degree O
as O
she’s O
in O
the O
last O
year O
of O
Uni. O
I O
gave O
her O
the O
space O
she O
needed O
after O
we O
talked, O
and O
since O
then O
we’ve O
talked O
a O
bit, O
but O
obviously O
the O
conversation O
is O
not O
as O
it O
was O
before. O
She O
said O
she O
doesn’t O
want O
for O
me O
to O
wait O
for O
her, O
because O
it O
would O
make O
her O
feel O
bad. O
In O
the O
meanwhile O
i B-Other
decided I-Other
to I-Other
stop I-Other
smoking I-Other
drinking(haven’t I-Other
been I-Other
drinking I-Other
a I-Other
lot I-Other
before I-Other
either, I-Other
but O
it O
messes O
with O
my O
training) O
and O
hitting O
the O
Gym O
to O
distract O
myself O
from O
thinking O
of O
her. O
My O
question O
is, O
should O
i O
wait O
for O
her O
to O
solve O
her O
stuff O
and O
get O
back O
together, O
even O
if O
that O
means O
waiting O
for O
half O
a O
year O
or O
so O
or O
should O
i O
just O
forget O
about O
her? O
I O
know O
she O
asked O
this O
for O
the O
right O
reasons, O
because O
she’s O
got O
a O
lot O
on O
her O
plate O
right O
now. O

[SEP]
My O
*honest* O
opinion O
-- O
as O
someone O
who O
knows O
neither O
of O
you O
-- O
is O
that O
she O
doesn't O
want O
you O
to O
wait O
it O
out O
because O
she O
does O
not O
want O
a O
relationship O
at O
all. O
From O
what O
you O
said, O
it O
sounds O
like O
she O
wants O
you O
to O
move O
on O
from O
her, O
because O
she O
has O
no O
intention O
of O
getting O
back O
together. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
may O
not O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
you. O
She O
just O
seems O
busy, O
and O
maybe O
she's O
trying O
to O
do O
the O
mature O
thing O
and O
end O
your O
relationship O
out O
of O
fairness O
to O
you O
before O
she O
gets O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
emotionally O
neglectful. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Either O
way, O
she O
has O
communicated O
her O
desires O
to O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Personally, O
I O
would O
back O
entirely O
off. O
Don't O
reach O
out O
to O
her. O
Don't O
place O
yourself O
on O
her O
path O
if O
you O
can O
possibly O
avoid O
it O
because O
it O
will O
be O
obvious O
that O
you're O
just O
trying O
to O
see O
her. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Let O
her O
come O
to O
you. O
If O
she O
decides O
things O
are O
worse O
without O
you, O
she'll O
let O
you O
know. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
you O
should O
work O
on O
accepting O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
situation. O
These O
things O
are O
the O
test O
of O
a O
person, O
and O
right O
now O
you O
have O
an O
opportunity O
to O
respond O
with O
respect O
and O
dignity O
to O
the O
needs O
of O
someone O
you O
care O
about. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
would O
definitely O
try O
adjusting O
to O
the O
idea O
of O
not O
being O
together O
at O
all O
anymore, O
even O
in O
the O
future. O
It O
may O
be O
painful O
and O
difficult, O
but O
the O
sooner O
you O
do O
it, O
the O
sooner O
you O
will O
heal. O
You O
have O
to O
decide O
that O
you O
wouldn't O
get O
back O
together O
with O
her O
even O
if O
she O
asked O
you O
to. O
Trying O
to O
get O
over O
someone O
when O
your O
mind O
doesn't O
agree O

they O

How O

[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
a O
libertarian O
I O
don’t O
really O
care O
anymore, O
every O
American O
makes O

decides O
what O
important O

themselves. O
[SEP]
You O
should O
probably O
look O
at O
your O

Your O

should O
look O
at O

[SEP]
Speaking O
for O
myself, O
I'd O
be O
happy O
to O
opt O
out O
of O
Social O
Security, O
as O
long O
as O
I O
got O
a O
one-time O
payment O
of O
all O
my O
contributions O
plus O
3% O
interest. O
[SEP]
If O
we're O
not O
paying O
so O
much O
money O
for O
entitlements, O
your O
taxes O
go O
down O
so O
you O
have O
more O
money O
to O
invest. O

So, O
money O
you O

even O
if O

putting O

that O

getting O
me O
to O
a O

And O
again, O

I O
don't O
have O
a O

the O

to O
move O

[SEP]

for O

How O
does O
that O

put O

today? O
If O
they O
can't O
start O
putting O
money O
away O
until O
they O
are O
say O
35, O
how O
do O
they O
get O
to O
a O

More O
if O
SS O
gets O

I'm O
not O
talking O
menial O
labor O
positions. O
Both O
are O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
white O

positions, O
and O
they O
just O
aren't O
going O

do O
that O
any O
time O
soon. O
[SEP]
Depends, O
My B-Family
dad I-Family
and I-Family
in I-Family

are I-Family
all I-Family
over I-Family
90. I-Family
You O
aren't O
getting O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
back, O
And O
certainly O
you O
would O
be O
broke O
if O
you O
had O
their O
medical O
expenses. O
[SEP]
By O
how O
much? O
are O
we O
cutting O
entitlements O
to O
cut O
down O
or O
stop O
deficit O
spending O
or O
are O
we O
cutting O
it O
to O
make O
sure O
people O
aren't O
getting O
something O
I'm O
not. O
If O
we O
cut O
both O
entitlements O
and O
how O
we O
pay O
for O
them O
we O
aren't O
doing O
as O
much. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So, O
I'll O
ask, O
have O
you O
spent O
money O
you O
should O
have O
saved? O
Is O
it O
absurd O
to O
take O
that O
money O
and O
repair O
your O
car O
so O
you O
can O
get O
to O
work? O
How O
about O
paying O
for O
your O
kid's O
surgery? O
And O
in O
35 O
years O
you O
just O
don't O
have O
the O
money O
to O
retire. O
I O
feel O
confident O
that O
most O
people O
aren't O
going O
have O
to O
make O
that O
decision O
sometime O
in O
their O
life. O
[SEP]
It's O
a O
nice O
theory O
that O
doesn't O
work O
in O
practice. O
Social O
security O
attackers O
seem O
to O
forget O
that O
SS O
hasn't O
been O
around O
forever. O
And O
before O
it O
was O
around, O
their O
was O
a O
lot O
more O
elderly O
poverty. O
AND O
the O
elderly O
weren't O
even O

nearly O
as O

as O
they O
do O

mid I-Age
50’s, I-Age
plan O

don't O
expect O
to O

it O

[SEP]
You’re O
lumping O
employees O
into O
a O
conversation O
about O
entitlements? O
You O
honestly O
don’t O
see O
the O
difference? O
[SEP]
Hey O
man. O
Well O
argued O
and O
referenced. O
I O
find O
this O
news O
disconcerting. O
[SEP]
eh O
it's O
still O
debatable. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
give O
lend O
money O
to O
a O
company O
so O
they O
can O
buy O
assets O
or O
pay O
employees O
to O
provide O
goods O
and O
services, O
that's O
clearly O
contributing O
value. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
buy O
property O
for O
the O
sole O
purpose O
of O
charging O
others O
to O
use O
it, O
I O
don't O
really O
see O
the O
contribution. O
[SEP]
You O
really O
don't O
understand O
what O
the O
average O
person O
makes. O
I'm O
using O
my O
family O
as O
an O
example, O
but O
they O
will O
be O
fine. O
The O
point O
is O
that O
even O
people O
in O
those O
positions O
aren't O
in O
a O
position O
to O
put O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
away. O
Yes, O
plenty O
of O
people O
can O
do O
what O
you O
are O
saying, O
but O
more O
and O
more O
people O
just O
aren't O
making O
that O
kind O
of O
money. O
Again, O
25% O
of O
Americans, O
not O
just O
kids, O
not O
just O
losers, O
one O
out O
of O
every O
four O
people, O
makes O
$15 O
or O
less. O
it O
is O
almost O
1/3 O
who O
makes O
$18 O
or O
less. O
People O
who O
want O
to O
live O
in O
a O
safe O
place, O
drive O
a O
decent O
used O
vehicle, O
who O
have O
healthcare O
with O
a O
$2000 O
deductible, O
don't O
have O
a O
few O
extra O
to O
put O
away. O
They O
aren't O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
double O
anything O
in O
the O
next O
10 O
years. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
People O
who O
work O
full O
time O
for O
say O
Walmart, O
still O
qualify O
for O
SNAP O
or O
Medicaid O
if O
they O
have O
a O
kid, O
but O
are O
a O
holes O
for O
not O
putting O
a O
few O
hundred O
away O
every O
month? O
[SEP]
Wait O
a O
minute: O
You O
are O
saying O
that O
six O
years O
of O
schoolteachers O
salary, O
with O
living O
expenses O
(assuming O
frugal O
living, O
of O
course) O
both O
wiped O
the O
debt O
and O
established O
a O
safe, O
guaranteed O
investment O
that O
is O
going O
to O
be O
1.3 O
million O
by O
retirement, O
with O
no O
contribution? O
Unless O
you O
are O
leaving O
out O
a O
very O
specific O
lucky O
break O
(like O
accidentially O
dumped O
5000 O
bucks O
into O
Bitcoin O
at O
the O
start O
or O
some O
such), O
I O
have O
some O
serious O
doubts O
this O
is O
even O
remotely O
repeatable, O
especially O
the O
part O
about O
the O
1.3 O
mill O
being O
guaranteed O
without O
contributions. O
A O
TON O
of O
high-end O
investment O
bankers O
would O
love O
that O
secret. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Or O
are O
we O
talking O
mid-to-late O
20th O
century O
here, O
and O
you O
already O
retired? O
I O
am O
no O
slouch O
in O
terms O
of O
financials, O
I O
run O
a O
business, O
and O
I O
even O
know O
a O
schoolteacher O
in O
the O
USA, O
but O
I O
see O
no O
way O
of O
making O
that O
work O
today. O
[SEP]
>I O
had O
undergrad O
debt O

Ummmm....He's O
not O
you? O

I O
don't O

he O
asking O
you O
for O
financial O
advice O
either. O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
and O
if O
you O
have O
1.3 O
you O
didn't O
graduate O
in O
the O
last O
20 O
or O
30 O
years. O
You O
also O
have O
to O
understand O
that O
you O
also O
invested O
during O
the O
greatest O
time O
to O
invest O
in O
history. O
So O
how O
much O
of O
that O
money O
you O
invested O
was O
put O
into O
your O
investment O
account O
by O
your O
employer? O
Most O
companies O
don't O
do O
that O
anymore, O
they O
don't O
even O
match. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now, O
remember O
what O
you O
made O
just O
after O
college, O
plug O
it O
into O
an O
inflation O
calculator O
and O
I O
almost O
guarantee O
that O
you O
made O
a O
lot O
more O
money O
than O
what O
would O
be O
say O
$45k O
today. O
Which O
is O
what O
a O
lot O
of O
companies O
want O
to O
pay O
a O
recent O
college O
grad. O
Lastly, O
while O
I O
am O
guessing, O
even O
after O
inflation, O
your O
student O
debt O
isn't O
what O
most O
students O
have. O
[SEP]

What O
is O
confusing? O
I O
said O
government O
provides O
over O
half O
the O
primary O
income O
for O
more O
than O
50% O
of O
the O
nation. O
[SEP]
[SEP]

the O
growth, O
stability O
and O
support O
of O
government, O

do O
all O
of O
the O
groups O

People O
do O
not O
generally O
vote O
against O
personal O
interests. O
[SEP]
As O
a O
socialist O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
comforting. O
For O
me O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
disconcerting, O
but O
as O
a O
student O
of O
poli-sci O
and O
observer O
of O
gov O
since O
the O
80s O
it O
is O
the O
natural O
pattern O
of O
all O
governments. O
Not O
surprising. O

If O
you O
buy O
property O
for O
the O
sole O
purpose O
of O
charging O
others O
to O
use O
it, O
I O
don't O
really O
see O
the O
contribution. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Even O
there O
you O
are O
contributing O
the O
property. O
Contributing O
the O
factors O
of O
production O
be O
they O
land O
or O
factory O
equipment O
IS O
a O
contribution O
to O
production. O
[SEP]

The O
point O
is O
that O
even O
people O

that O
kind O
of O

away. O

Again, O
25% O

one O
out O

out O

Yes O

They're O

earning O
the O
same O
$15/hour O
a O

if O
they O

that's O
a O

putting O

know O
why O
you'd O
call O

yes O
by O

if O
you're O
not O
able O
to O
put O
at O

a O
little O
something O
away O
for O

each O

is O
with O
you. O
WalMart O
will O
even O
kick O

makes O
it O
that O
much O
easier. O
Though O
I'd O
suggest O
keeping O
your O

open O
for O
better O

than O
Walmart... O
it's O
still O
a O
sellers O
market O
for O
labor O
and O
you O
and O
do O
better O
than O
WalMart O
and O
at O
35 O
years O
old O
you O
almost O
certainly O
have O
the O
experience O
to O
do O
better O
than O
$15/hour O
or O
should O
be O
very O
eager O
to O
gain O
it. O
[SEP]
Yes. O
I B-Finance
was I-Finance
making I-Finance
$65k I-Finance
a I-Finance
year I-Finance
and I-Finance
had I-Finance
around I-Finance
$20k I-Finance
in I-Finance
debt. I-Finance
It O
was O
this O
past O
decade. O
I O
saved O
around O
$130k, O
which O
will O
grow O
to O
$1M. O
But O
starting O
next O
year O
I O
will O
make O
$300+k O
so O
obviously O
I O
can O
save O
more. O
[SEP]
No, O
you O
misunderstand. O
I O
graduated O
within O
the O
last O
decade. O
Virtually O
none O
of O
the O
money O
was O
put O
into O
investment O
by O
my O
employer. O
[SEP]
> O
Yeah, O
and O
if O
you O
have O
1.3 O
you O
didn't O
graduate O
in O
the O
last O
20 O
or O
30 O
years. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He's O
not O
saying O
he O
has O
$1.3 O
NOW O
but O
that O
he O
will O
be O
the O
time O
he O
retires O
given O
what O
he's O
already O
put O
into O
his O
account O
assuming O
historic O
average O
returns... O
That O
will O
only O
go O
up O
dramatically O
as O
he O
continues O
to O
contribute O
over O
the O
years. O
[SEP]
Mines O
more O
because O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
rely O
on O
any O
government O
program. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Plus O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
long O
term O
health O
problems. O
[SEP]
Working O
isn’t O
an O
entitlement O
[SEP]
Y'all O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
twisted O
view O
of O
socialist. O
It's O
not O
synonymous O
with O
big O
govt O
and O
command O
economies. O
We're O
not O
all O
Leninists O
or O
Maoists. O
American O
socialist O
traditions O
tend O
to O
be O
a O
lot O
more O
libertarian O
and O
decentralized O
than O
their O
European O
and O
Asian O
counterparts, O
organized O
around O
unions O
or O
other O
non-governmental O
organizations. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
classic O
formulation O
for O
socialism O
is O
"workers O
control O
the O
means O
of O
productions O
(and O
transportation, O
development, O
etc.)". O
Does O
today's O
federal O
government O
strike O
you O
as O
particularly O
pro-worker? O
[SEP]
No, O
the O
property O
already O
existed O
prior O
to O
your O
purchase. O
If O
you O
bought O
empty O
land O
and O
built O
homes O
on O
it, O
sure O
now O
I O
see O
a O
contribution. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
buy O
existing O
property O
you O
didn't O
do O
anything, O
ownership O
just O
changed. O
If O
you O
say O
you O
provide O
maintenance O
to O
the O
property, O
well O
are O
you O
personally O
providing O
the O
maintenance? O
If O
you're O
hiring O
others O
to O
do O
the O
maintenance, O
you're O
factoring O
that O
cost O
into O
the O
rent O
you're O
asking O
and O
it's O
actually O
the O
tenant O
paying O
for O
the O
maintenance. O
[SEP]
So O
if O
I O
may O
ask, O
your O
kids O
who O
are O
making O
$15 O
an O
hour, O
are O
they O
out O
on O
their O
own? O
Paying O
rent O
and O
everything O
else O
others O
pay? O
Again, O
I O
get O
that O
this O
is O
your O
kids, O
but O
who O
are O
the O
people O
they O
work O
with? O
If O
the O
car O
they O
drive O
needs O
an O
expensive O
repair, O
can O
they O
rely O
on O
you O
to O
get O
to O
work? O
Or O
is O
their O
job O
threatened? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
as O
for O
Walmart, O
You're O
right O
they O
do O
match O
6%, O
but O
if O
you O
want O
health O
insurance, O
it O
costs O
you O
over O
$200 O
a O
month, O
for O
a O
policy O
with O
a O
$2000 O
deductible O
and O
then O
80/20. O
So O
even O
if O
you O
are O
making O
$12 O
an O
hour O
about O
$2000 O
a O
month, O
$1600 O
after O
taxes O
(generous) O
then O
pay O
for O
insurance O
$1400 O
a O
month. O
Yeah O
if O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
food O
and O
gas O
and O
pay O
rent, O
you O
aren't O
donating O
a O
lot O
to O
your O
retirement O
fund. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
for O
advancement, O
no O
that O
is O
kind O
of O
the O
point, O
Companies O
work O
to O
keep O
pay O
as O
low O
as O
possible. O
People O
working O
retail O
just O
don't O
get O
yearly O
raises. O
When O
I O
got O
my O
first O
job O
in O
the O
late O
1970s O
I O
got O
min O
wage O
of O
$2.10, O
BUT O
the O
full O
time O
people O
got O
$2.80 O
to O
start. O
they O
got O
holiday O
bonuses O
and O
yearly O
raises. O
Some O
people O
were O
there O
for O
20 O
years, O
even O
at O
5 O
or O
10 O
cents O
a O
year O
they O
were O
making O
$5 O
an O
hour O
(over O
$22.00 O
in O
today's O
money.) O
Retail O
managers O
aren't O
making O
that O
in O
many O
stores O
today. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Hell O
my O
wife O
works O
for O
a O
world O
famous O
hospital. O
They O
are O
looking O
to O
pay O
$45k O
a O
year O
for O
positions O
that O
require O
a O
degree O
(at O
least O
you O
get O
good O
healthcare.) O
Raises O
have O
been O
averaging O
under O
3% O
a O
year, O
(inflation O
is O
higher) O
No O
matching O
for O
their O
retirement. O
And O
those O
are O
"good" O
jobs. O
[SEP]
So O
assuming O
you O
have O
a O
130k O
start, O
and O
you O
ll O
retire O
in O
40 O
years O
(I O
d O
assume O
less O
given O
your O
new O
salary, O
but O
lets O
use O
it O
as O
a O
nice O
round O
number) O
you O
d O
have O
to O
have O
a O
stable O
6% O
returns O
rate, O
and O
zero O
taxation O
on O
that O
income. O
Thats O
a O
REALLY O
sweet O
deal O
you O
got O
there, O
and O
I O
dont O
think O
people O
can O
replicate O
this O
easily. O
Where O
I O
live, O
5% O
is O
considered O
the O
top O
end O
of O
low O
risk O
investment, O
typically O
real O
estate O
in O
safe O
areas. O
Capital O
income O
tax O
takes O
a O
25% O
bite O
out O
of O
the O
returns, O
and O
of O
course O
you O
need O
to O
consider O
inflation, O
so O
to O
maintain O
the O
actual O
value O
you O
d O
need O
close O
to O
8-10% O
depending O
on O
how O
the O
new O
inflation O
settles. O
[SEP]

Congratulations O
on O
doing O
something O
few O
people O
can O
probably O
pull O
off, O
but O
as O
advice O
its O
a O
little O
bit O
unrealistic, O
esp. O
to O
a O
60 O
year O
old O
with O
2 O
kids. O
[SEP]
Who O
makes O
$300K O
a O
year? O
That's O
not O
even O
remotely O
possible O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
Americans. O
[SEP]
Are O
you O
saying O
that O
if O
you O
just O
keep O
it O
there O
it O
will O
grow O
to O
1.3 O
million? O
As O
someone O
who O
is O
64, O
you O
can't O
know O
that. O
But O
even O
if O
you O
are O
close, O
I O
commend O
you. O
But O
you O
have O
to O
understand O
that O
most O
teachers O
aren't O
making O
enough O
money O
to O
put O
what O
20k O
into O
a O
retirement O
account. O
(I O
am O
assuming O
that O
is O
what O
you O
would O
need O
to O
do O
to O
get O
it O
to O
grow O
to O
1.3 O
mill. O
by O
retirement. O

you O

It O
is O
just O
insurance. O
[SEP]
That's O
not O
the O
point. O
The O
point O
is O
that O
the O
government O
is O
responsible O
for O
over O
half O
of O
American's O
income O
[SEP]
No O
of O
course O
not. O
But O
two O
points. O
1. O
Government O
employees O
keep O
their O
jobs O
by O
distributing O
government O
funds. O
2. O
If O
government O
is O
cut O
many O
government O
jobs O
could O
disappear. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Government O
workers O
have O
a O
vested O
interest O
in O
keeping O
government O
big, O
slow, O
ponderous O
and O
bloated. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
not O
saying O
the O
are O
dumb, O
lazy, O
ripping O
off O
the O
public O
or O
the O
job O
is O
not O
useful. O
Just O
saying O
they O
vote O
their O

your O
point. O

one O
another O
so O
they O
can O
reap O
the O
economic O
advantages O

so O
property O

intrinsic O
value O

itself O

out O

what O

is O
far O
from O
it. O

would O
agree O

an O
obligation O
to O
offer O
help O
to O
the O

such O
as O
the O

you O
and O
I O
may O
disagree O
on O
the O
form O
that O
help O
takes O
or O
the O
mechanisms O
which O
provide O
it. O
But O
you O
can't O
call O
your O
description O
typical O
when O
it's O
not. O
[SEP]
Agreed O
[SEP]
Yes, O
they O
are. O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Almost O
true. O
The O
exchange O

fits O
here, O

the O
renting O

not. O
Renting O
is O
a O
phenomena O
that O
the O

happen O

ticket O
scalpers O
make O
sense O
because O

tickets O
are O

below O
the O

people O
are O
willing O
to O
pay, O
scalpers O
can O
jump O
in, O
buy O
up O
the O
supply O
and O
resell O
for O
profit. O
Scalpers O
are O
opportunists, O
but O
they O
are O
not O
contributing O

They O
simply O
exist O

OK, O
I O
have O

that O

what? O
80 O

But O
my O
point O
is O
that O
there O
are O
many O
many O

just O
don't O
pay O
that O
much. O
People O
are O
a O
sickness O
or O
a O
car O
repair O
from O
being O
homeless O
and O
the O
real O
problem O
is O
that O
they O
aren't O
take O
15% O
of O
what O
they O
make O
and O
putting O
it O
away O
because O
people O
who O
make O
six O

The O
reason O
for O
vertical O
construction O
has O
nothing O
to O

with O

to O
do O
the O
scarcity O
and O
thus O
value O
of O
real O

regardless O
of O

There O
are O
reasons O
people O
congregate O
together O
in O
densely O

and O
they O
have O
done O
so O
throughout O

is O
always O
pursued O

Land O
you O
can O

[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
you're O
missing O
the O
point. O
The O
point O
is O
land O
you O
can O
live O
on O
is O
a O
scarce O
resource. O
We're O
not O
pioneers O
on O
a O
largely O
uninhabited O
frontier O
where O
land O
is O
not O
a O
scarce O
resource. O
Scarcity O
makes O
it O
valuable O
and O
thus O
costly. O
This O
costliness O
means O
that O
there O
is O
real O
value O
to O
being O
able O
to O
utilize O
property O
WITHOUT O
having O
to O
devote O
and O
put O
at O
risk O
your O
own O
resources O
up O
front O
necessary O
to O
make O
a O
purchase O
either O
because O
you O
don't O
have O
such O
resources O
or O
because O
you O
have O
better O
uses O
for O
them. O
THIS O
is O
a O
very O
real O
value O
which O
a O
landlord O
is O
providing O
to O
his O
tenants: O
He O
invested O
HIS O
resources O
up-front, O
and O
is O
putting O
HIS O
resources O
at O
risk O
so O
YOU O
don't O
have O
to. O
And O
the O
premium O
he's O
able O
to O
charge O
above O
his O
own O
costs O
is O
set O
by O
the O
value O
of O
his O
service O
determined O
by O
the O
competition O
between O
landlords O
and O
between O
potential O
tenants O
in O
a O
free O
market O
for O
real O
estate O
and O
rental O
units. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
think O
his O
service O
is O
of O
no O
value O
then O
you're O
free O
to O
not O
use O
it. O
Go O
out O
and O
buy O
the O
property O
rather O
than O
pay O
rent. O
If O
the O
reason O
you O
don't O
is O
because O
you O
*can't*... O
That O
just O
*proves* O
that O
he O
is O
contributing O
something O
of O
real O
value O
for O
his O
rental O
income. O

[SEP]
I O

for O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Go O

i O
like O
ferrel’s O
on O
mission O
best, O
but O
others O
have O
their O
faves. O
Its O
a O
great O
donut O
and O
coffee O
town. O
Go O
to O
año O
nuevo O
state O
park O
and O
see O
the O
elephant O
seals O
(probably O
look O
into O
booking O
that O
now). O
Walk O
the O
bluffs O
at O
wilder O
ranch. O
Walk O
the O
wharf. O
Watch O
surfing O
at O
steamer O
lane. O
Try O
surfing O
in O
capitola. O
Does O
anyone O
in O
your O
family O
skateboard? O
Buy O
t O
shirts, O
at O
least O
one O
with O
a O

hand O
on O
it. O
Rent O

Edit: O
tidepooling O
is O
a O
must O
do. O
There O
will O
be O
some O
huge O
tides O
that O
week, O
unfortunately O
the O
peak O
low O
is O
going O
to O
be O
after O
dark. O
Personally, O
id O
bundle O
up O
and O
go O
out O
with O
my O
flashlight O
in O
the O
pleasure O
point O
area O
to O
look O
around. O
You O
are O
looking O
at O
a O
-1.5 O
tide O
on O
Christmas O
around O
6:00pm. O
Stuff O
will O
probably O
pretty O
exposed O
around O
sunset. O
So O
you O
can O
see O
some O
of O
the O
creatures O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
daylight O
left. O
[SEP]
Book O
a O

One O
of O
the O

Plus O
all O
the O

Mike’s O

It’s O
not O

though! O
There’s O
also O
Alderwood, O
also O
not O
cheap. O

Check O
out O
the O

on O

They O
have O
great O
gifts. O
There’s O
a O
comic O
and O
game O

right O
there O
too, O

Lunch O
at O
the O

place O
Zoccolies O

at O

Get O

That’s O
all O
on O

Check O
out O
the O
beaches, O
obviously. O
The O

is O
great O
but O
I’m O
not O
sure O
if O
it’s O
open. O
[SEP]
Many O
locals O
will O
scoff O
at O
this, O
but O
Shadowbrook O
in O
Capitola O
is O
a O
beautiful O
dinner O
experience. O
The O
food O
is O
average, O
the O
prices O
are O
expensive, O
but O
the O
building, O
setting O
and O
overall O
experience O
is O
really O
quite O
special O
and O
something O
I O
personally O
would O
consider O
around O
Christmas O
time. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Additionally, O
the O
boardwalk O
usually O
has O
an O
ice O
rink O
setup, O

next O

a O

Walk O
around O

Get O
treats O

go O

But O
I O

even O

can O
it O
still O
damage O
your O
eyes O
due O
to O
long O
exposure O
even O

Thank O
you. O
[SEP]
If O
you're O
wearing O
the O
right O
eye O
protection O
at O
the O
proper O
time, O
and O
wearing O
it O
correctly, O
your O

will O
be O
fine, O
even O
with O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Your O

system O

less O

wear O
a O
good O

and O
check O
your O

[SEP]
Put O
your O
safety O
first O
, O
think O
of O
the O
long O
haul O
…. O
The O
ones O
that O
last O
in O
this O
game O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
protect O
themselves O
and O
work O
smart O
. O
Treat O
your O
body O
like O
shit O
and O
it O
will O
break O
down O
. O
Yea O
it’s O
not O
the O
safest O
trade O
but O
there’s O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
idiots O
who O
skip O
safety O
and O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
it. O
[SEP]
Use O
the O
proper O
shade O
number O
for O
what O
you're O
doing. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
saw O
guys O
using O
number O
8 O
shades O
while O
stick O
welding O
cuz O
"they O
couldn't O
see O
the O
pool" O
fucking O
blinding O
when O
I O
tried O
their O
hood. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
are O
also O
using O
glass. O
Auto O
seems O
to O
be O
"lighter" O
than O
glass O
I O
was O
11 O
with O
glass O
and O
auto O
I O
was O
12. O
Stick O
at O
125amps. O
[SEP]
The O
damage O
from O
welding O
comes O
from O
UV O
exposure. O
Every O
welding O
hood O
will O
block O
it O
completely O
and O
even O
clear O
polycarbonate O
lenses O
will O
block O
over O
99%, O
so O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
ALWAYS O
be O
wearing O
clear O
safeties O
in O
a O
shop O
environment, O
even O
under O
a O
welding O
hood, O
in O
case O
you O
accidentally O
get O
flashed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
someone O
else O
said, O
the O
much O
much O
more O
significant O
long O
term O
exposure O
risk O
is O
respiratory. O
[SEP]
I O
believe O
that O
it O
can. O
I O
have O
been O
welding O
for O
decades, O
and O
I O
always O
use O
the O
darkest O
shade O
available, O
usually O
a O
12. O
But O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
given O
day, O
I O
still O
feel O
eyestrain O
and O
irritation O
on O
occasion. O
I O
also O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
floaters, O
which O
I O
feel O
developed O
over O
time O
while O
welding. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also O
you O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
about O
the O
arc O
flash O
reflecting O
off O
stuff O
behind O
you O
and O
coming O
in O
from O
the O
back O
of O
the O
helmet. O
And O
then O
there O
are O
the O
inevitable O
unintentional O
arc O
strikes O
where O
you O
end O
up O
getting O
flashed O
by O
someone O
else. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
are O
super O
careful O
and O
use O
the O
proper O
PPE O
you O
will O
likely O
be O
OK, O
but O
the O
potential O
is O
still O
there O
and O
you O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
that. O
[SEP]
[deleted] O
[SEP]
Yes O
but O
not O
the O
way O
you O
think. O
Think O
like O
a O
lifetime O
of O
reading O
eye O
strain. O
Super O
focused O
on O
minute O
detailed O
things O
[SEP]
The O
long-term O
effects O
of O
welding O
very O
very O
close O
it's O
tough O
on O
the O
eyes O
seriously O
have O
you O
seen O
any O
old O
welders O
you O
don't O
have O
glasses O
on O
when O
you O
focus O
your O
muscles O
that O
close O
to O
your O
face O
all O
the O
time O
and O
puts O
a O
lot O
of O
strain O
on O
them O
so O
you O
have O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
that O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
shielding O
glass O
keeping O
your O
eyes O
safe O
yeah O
you'll O
be O
fine O
[SEP]
You O
have O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
are O
on O
the O
right O
shade O
[SEP]
You’ll O
get O
arc O
flash… O
a O
lot. O
But O
that’s O
just O
part O
of O
the O
trade. O
However O
(correct O
me O
if O
I’m O
wrong), O
some O
if O
not O
most O
safety O
glasses O
by O
them O
selves O
have O
a O
slight O
amount O
of O
UV O
protection. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
for O
daily O
under O
the O
hood, O
there’s O
different O
shade O
levels O
and O
it’s O
all O
up O
to O
preference O
from O
there. O
[SEP]
Everything O
in O
life O
will O
kill O
you. O
Happy O
Friday!! O
[SEP]
Even O
with O
protection O
if O
you O
don’t O
have O
a O
full O
headgear O
you O
can O
get O
some O
exposure O
from O
other O
welders O
in O
the O
shop. O
Depends O
on O
how O
many O
and O
if O
there O
are O
screens O
available. O
I O
just O
weld O
at O
home O
so O
not O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
but O
an O
associate O
is O
a O
production O
welder O
and O
he O
occasionally O
gets O
some O
exposure O
from O
others. O
Also O
you O
need O
to O
set O
your O
hood O
setting O
correct O
or O
have O
the O
correct O
fixed O
lens O
for O
the O
process O
you O
are O
using. O
(There’s O
plenty O
on O
the O
internet O
to O
advise O
lens O
shade O
or O
equivalent O
for O
different O
processes) O
happy O
welding! O

The O
hardest O
thing O

what O
happened O
to O
the O

I O
left O

[SEP]
Not O
really, O
but O
yes. O
Any O
exposure O
to O
UV O
light O
is O
damaging. O
Using O
the O
proper O
shade O
will O
just O
delay O
the O
inevitable. O
The O
real O
question O
is O
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
blind O
at O
60 O

90. O
[SEP]

on O
the O

[SEP]
Get O

use O
at O

a O
12 O

in O

developed O
night O

I O
could O
have O
done O

to O

them. O

Hello! O
Just O
keep O
in O
mind, O
the O
light O
you O
are O
protecting O
from, O
is O
uv O
light, O
so O
it O
is O
invisible, O
is O
not O
the O
glare O
you O
can O
see O
when O
welding. O
[SEP]
That O
being O
said, O
if O
your O
are O
next O
to O
other O
people O
welding, O
let's O
say O
in O
a O
classroom, O
even O
if O
you O
are O
not O
welding O
remember O
that O
that O
light O
still O
bounces O
in O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
room, O
so O
if O
you O
think O
that O
as O
long O
you O
are O
not O
staring O
at O
the O
visible O
glare O
your O
are O
ok, O
you'd O
be O
wrong, O
all O
the O
people O
in O
the O
room O
will O
be O
the O
same O
exposed O
to O
a O
light O
that O
behaves O
like O
light O
but O
you O
cannot O
see. O

from O

Holy O

I O
can’t O

welding O

a O
shade O
lower O

11, O

honestly O
even O
11 O
was O

I O
typically O
weld O
with O

sometimes O
I’ll O
drop O
to O

if O
my O

just O

bare O

standards. O
[SEP]
I O
welded O
for O
8 O
months O
before O
moving O
into O
the O
office. O
That’s O
all O
I O
the O
time O
I O
needed O
to O
tell O
what O
welding O
would O
do O
to O
me O
after O
10 O

It’s O
a O

I O

it O

I O

99% O

I O

I O
just O

more. O

tomorrow O
I’ll O

you O

Dear O
people, O
I’m B-Health
with I-Health
sertraline I-Health
since B-Time
august I-Time
2022 I-Time
(anxiety, B-Mental_Health
panic, I-Mental_Health
PTSD). I-Mental_Health
I O
think O
it O
is O
working…but O
very O
slow. O
Therefore O
my O
question: O
how O
long O
dit O
it O
take O
to O
work? O
Suddenly O
or O
slow? O
[SEP]
Thanks O
in O
advance O
for O
your O
feedback🙂 O
[SEP]
2 O
to O
6 O
weeks O
[SEP]
25mg O
currently. O
Third O
day O
I O
had O
windows O
of O
time O
where O
that O
heavy O
cloud O
was O
lifted. O
That O
feeling O
became O
more O
frequent O
as O
the O
days O
went O
on O
taking O
Zoloft. O
[SEP]
What O
dosage O
are O
you O
on? O
I'm O
nearly O
7 O
weeks O
into O
50mg, O
can't O
tell O
if O
it's O
working O
or O
not O
😅 O
[SEP]
I've O
been O
on O
it O
since O
August O
as O
well. O
It O
has O
worked... O
but O
by O
like O
10%. O
I'll O
take O
whatever O
improvement O
I O
get O
though. O
[SEP]
9 O
weeks O
before O
first O
improvements. O
[SEP]
About O
3-4 O
weeks O
for O
me. O
I O
moved O
up O
doses O
to O
100mg O
within O
3 O
weeks O
though O
because O
I O
was O
dealing O
with O
severe O
panic O
disorder. O
Most O
people O
don’t O
up O
their O
dose O
as O
quickly O
as O
I O
did. O
[SEP]
I O
got O
immediate O
calming O
effect. O
And O
that’s O
pretty O
much O
stayed O
with O
me O
since O
day O
1. O
I O
on O
and O
off O
feel O
happier O
and O
I’m O
not O
snapping O
at O
people O
or O
threatening O
to O
call O
the O
cops O
on O
anyone O
since O
I O
started O
[SEP]
8 O
months O
[SEP]
What O
dose? O
[SEP]
My O
psychiatrist O
started O
me O
at O
50mg O
four O
days O
ago, O
and O
wants O
me O
to O
take O
100mg O
from O
the O
second O
week O
forward. O
I'm O
about O
upping O
the O
dosage O
so O
quickly. O
What O
should O
I O
expect? O
[SEP]
The O
most O
side O
effects O
I’ve O
had O
has O
been O
being O
a O
little O
shaky. O
I O
also O
had O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
“floaty” O
feeling O
right O
after O
I O
upped O
the O
dose. O
I O
did O
a O
week O
at O
50mg O
and O
then O
a O
week O
at O
75mg O
before O
moving O
to O
100 O
though. O
I O
didn’t O
go O
straight O
from O
50 O
to O
100. O
You O
could O
try O
doing O
75 O
for O
a O
few O
days O
first. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
replying. O
My O
most O
major O
side O
effect O
has O
been O
insomnia. O
I O
haven't O
driven O
in O
a O
month. O
[SEP]
That’s O
so O
rough. O
I O
relate. O
I B-Health
had I-Health
awful I-Health
insomnia I-Health
for I-Health
a I-Health
while I-Health
too I-Health
but O
for O
me O
it B-Health
was I-Health
because I-Health
of I-Health
my I-Health
panic I-Health
disorder I-Health
and I-Health
OCD I-Health
flare I-Health
up I-Health
since O
I B-Health
was I-Health
having I-Health
insomnia I-Health
before I-Health
getting I-Health
on I-Health
Zoloft. I-Health
Once O
Zoloft O
started O
kicking O
in O
it O
got O
better. O
I O
know O
insomnia O
is O
a O
common O
side O
effect O
with O
starting O
so O
I’m O
sure O
it’ll O
clear O
up O
for O
you O
soon! O

Look O
at O
it O
this O
way, O
animals? O
They're O
forgiving O
as O
hell. O
It's O
fine O
to O
feel O
a O

guilty O
but O
your O

has O
probably O
already O

right O

you. O

after O
you O

them O

then O
just O
put O
some O
earplugs O

noise O

set O

1-1.5 O

I O
realized O
I O
can't O
deal O

repetition O
when O
a O
neighbor's O
dog O
spent O
all O
morning O
barking O
continuously O
and O
I O
started O
punching O
holes O
in O
my O

to O
relieve O
the O
feelings O
building O
up O
in O
me, O
and O
this O
is O
100x O
as O
frustrating O
(I O
never O
have O
and O
never O
will O
hit O
my O
kids, O
I O
instead O
let O
it O
build O
until O
I O
can't O

then O
I O
go O

sit O

take O
a O

something). O

The O
animals O
in O
my O
house O
are O
a O
huge O
trigger O
for O
me. O
They O
over O
stimulate O
the O
shit O
outta O
me O
and O
if O
I O
could O
go O
back O
and O
not O
get O
them, O
I O
would. O
I O
feel O
soooo O
badly O
about O
that O
because O
they O
of O
course O
deserve O
to O
be O
loved O
and O
adored, O
but O
after O
having O
a O
kid O
I O
just O
don’t O
have O
the O
energy O
for O
them O
anymore. O
All O
my O
spoons O
go O
to O
my O
child. O
Please O
don’t O
feel O
bad. O
We O
don’t O
pick O
what O
overstimulates O
us. O

estj/entj. O
90% O

I O
really O

something O

it O

it O

However O
every O

I O
read O
estj O

I O
always O
relate O

rarely O

anything O

the O

I O
also O

every O

it O
just O
now. O
Are O
you O
talking O
about O
PoLR? O
[SEP]
I O
am. O
I O
want O
you O
to O
explain O
it O
that O

things O
more. O
[SEP]
Right.. O
well O
like O
I O
said O
I O
don’t O
know O
anything O
about O
it O
yet O
so O
ig O
I O
can’t O
do O
that O
[SEP]
So O
maybe O
I O
should O
just O
type O
you O
afresh. O
It O
will O
help O
you O
out O
and O
you’d O
learn O
a O
lot. O
If O
you’re O
really O
what O
you O
think O
it O
will O
not O
hert O
you, O
if O
you’re O
not O
that O
will O
completely O
retype O
you. O
[SEP]
Sure O
I O
have O
no O
problem O
with O
that, O
but O
I O
am O
wondering O
why O
you’re O
having O
such O
a O
hard O
time O
answering O
my O
question. O
Also O
why O
are O
you O
so O
interested O
in O
helping O
me? O
[SEP]
Because O
I O
want O
to O
help O
people O
find O

me O

I O

[SEP]
Back O
in O
July O
I O
was O
last O
minute O
invited O
to O
come O
live O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends, O
5 O
people O
in O
a O
4 O
bedroom O
because O
rent O
was O
too O
high. O
I O
agreed O
being O
told O
I O
would O
have O
a O
ground O
level O
room O
and O
since O
I O
have O
a O
parrot O
the O
sunlight O
is O
MUCH O
needed. O
Well O
the O
week O
before O
I O
moved O
my O
belongings O
one O
of O
the O
original O
housemates O
decided O
she O
(26f) B-Age_Gender
was O
moving O
out O
and O
they O
filled O
the O
spot O
same O
day. O
Problem O
is O
the O
new O
person O
E O
(25m) B-Age_Gender
got O
the O
room O
I O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
and O
I O
was O
assigned O
the O
corner O
basement O
room. O
Apparently O
E O
and O
one O
of O
the O
housemates O
(D) O
are O
exes O
and O
D's O
current O
partner O
(F) B-Gender
does O
not O
want O
them O
on O
the O

(But O
same O

is O
ok?) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
3 O
massive O
artificial O
lights O
now O
for O
my O
bird O
because O
this O
room O
is O
so O
far O
underground O
there O
is O
no O
sunlight O
at O
all O
:(. O
I O
have O
to O
play O
bird O
videos O
instead O
of O
the O
birdfeeder O
I O
wanted O
to O
set O
up O
and O
I O
just O
feel O
so O
bad O
for O
him O
because O
he's O
in O
this O
dark O
basement O
alone. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
group O
doesn't O
really O
seem O
to O
care O
and O
have O
explained O
to O
me O
that O
it's O
basically O
tough O
shit O
and O
drop O
it. O
I O
have, O
but O
the O
whole O
reason O
I O
chose O
to O
move O
here O
was O
because O
I O
was O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
I O
would O
have O
a O
good O
set O
up O
for O
my O
parrot. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
I O
feel O
that O
I O
sound O
unreasonable O
and O
ungrateful O
yea? O
Well O
E O
is O
never O
even O
home. O
80% O
of O
the O
time O
the O
room O
is O
empty, O
he O
spends O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
at O
work O
and O
at O
his O
partners O
house O
and O
stays O
there O
overnight O
often. O
I O
get O
to O
look O
at O
this O
beautifully O
bright O
empty O
room O
every O
day. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
really O
appreciative O
about O
being O
asked O
to O
move O
in O
but O
I O
am O
kinda O
mad O
that O
I O
was O
tossed O
aside O
like O
that. O
How O
should O
I O
proceed? O
I O
know O
I O
should O
just O
drop O
it O
but O
I O
keep O
feeling O
slighted O
about O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also O
the O
lot O
of O
them O
failed O
to O
mention O
they O
aren't O
extending O
the O
lease O
and O
everyone O
else O
already O
has O
plans O
to O
move O
somewhere O
specific O
and O
I O
had O
to O
find O
out O
through O
a O
mutual O
friend. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
TLDR: O
Roommates O
invited O
me O
to O
live O
with O

and O
changed O
the O
plans O
without O

[SEP]
Your O
balls O
hurting O
is O
called O
having O
blue O
balls. O
That O
happens O
when O
fluids O
(not O
semen, O
that's O
not O
stored O
in O
the O
balls) O
accumulate O
in O
your O
balls O
from O
being O
aroused O
and O
not O
releasing. O
It O
creates O
a O
pressure O
that O
hurts. O
Probably O
happened O
because O
you O
watched O
porn. O
Now O
you O
know O
why O
you O
shouldn't O
do O
that. O
The O
pain O
might O
go O
away O
on O
its O
own O
but O
I O
heard O
that O
applying O
cold O
helps, O
or O
doing O
squats O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
weight O
(warm O
your O
legs O
up O
first). O
Hope O
you O
manage. O
Also, O
motivation O
is O
great O
and O
makes O
things O
easier O
but O
real O
strength O
comes O
from O
discipline, O
i.e. O
being O
able O
to O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
even O
if O
you O
don't O
feel O
like O
it. O
So O
even O
if O
you O
release O
and O
don't O
feel O
motivated O
don't O
take O
that O
as O
an O
excuse O
to O
not O
do O
the O
work. O
Accept O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
just O
won't O
be O
as O
easy. O
Hope O
you O
manage O
to O
hang O

hour O

a O
half O

3 O
large O
men O
proceeded O
to O
intimate O
me O
insisting O
that O
it O
was O
not O
a O
racially O

incident O
because O
the O
manager O
was O
black, O
as O
I O
didn’t O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on O
and O
couldn’t O
provide O
them O
with O
any O
information O
since O
I O
hadn’t O
stolen O
anything O
they O
proceeded O
to O
calm O

they O
had O
thirty O
cctv O
footage O
of O

looking O
through O

taking O

however O
when O
I O

Unbeknownst O
to O
me O
while O
I O
was O
being O
held O
by O
security, O
there O
was O
another O
bouncer O
who O
had O
gone O
to O
my O
friend O
(who O
had O
lost O
her O
bag) O
and O
told O
her O
that O
he O
thought O
that O
I O
had O
mental O
health O
issues, O
that O
I O
was O
lying O
to O
her O
and O
that O
she O
should O
find O
better O
friends. O
So O
when O
I O
was O
eventually O
released O
and O
we O
all O
got O
in O
our O
lift O
to O
go O
home O
she O
brutally O
attacked O
me O
in O
the O
car O
ripping O
out O
clumps O
of O
my O
hair O
[SEP]
[SEP]
In O
the O
aftermath O
the O
next O
day O
she O
threw O
all O
of O
my O
things O
outside O
into O
the O
rain O
and O
filled O
my O
bags O
with O
her O
dogs O
poop O
before O
spitting O
on O
my O
things O
resulting O
in O
damages O
to O
various O
expensive O
pieces O
of O
technology O
and O
I O
had O
most O
of O
my O
clothing O
ruined O
by O
the O
damp, O
She O
made O
various O
TikTok’s O
that O
she O
eventually O
took O
down O
boasting O
about O
the O
way O
she O
had O
attacked O
me O
and O
she O
has O
crippled O
my O
social O
life O
as O
she O
has O
told O
anyone O
that O
will O
listen O
that O
I’m O
not O
a O
good O
person O
and O
that O
I’m O
a O
thief O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
i O
was O
all O
a O
misunderstanding O
and O
her O
bad O
was O
found O
in O
the O
end O
with O
everything O
still O
in O
it O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
life O
now O
is O
a O
shell O
of O
what O
I O
used O
to O
be, O
I O
rally O
go O
out O
because O
In O
my O
small O
town O
I O
am O
almost O
always O
met O
with O
dirty O
looks O
of O
comments O
from O
individuals O
who O
believe O
the O
false O
accusations O
made O
against O
me O

I O
was O
just O
hoping O
that O
someone O
on O
this O

know O

something O
I O
can O
do O

So O
you’ve O
had O
numerous O
crimes O
committed O
against O
you O
here O
that O
you O
should O
go O
to O
the O
police O
about. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
first O
is O
false O
imprisonment. O
The O
line O
between O
citizens O
arrest O
and O
false O
imprisonment O
is O
that O
obviously O
debatable O
but O
they’ve O
gone O
far O
over O
it O
in O
this O
case O
because: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
- O
The O
crime O
is O
not O
serious. O
[SEP]
- O
There O
is O
little O
evidence O
you O
did O
it. O
You O
didn’t O
have O
the O
bag O
on O
you. O
[SEP]
- O
They O
held O
you O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half. O
You’re O
only O
supposed O
to O
hold O
someone O
until O
the O
police O
arrive. O
Obviously O
the O
police O
would O
have O
arrived O
much O
sooner O
than O
that O
or O
the O
police O
would O
have O
told O
them O
to O
let O
you O
go. O
Clearly O
they O
didn’t O
even O
ring O
the O
police O
which O
means O
it O
doesn’t O
count O
as O
a O
citizens O
arrest, O
just O
false O
imprisonment. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
should O
go O
to O
the O
police O
over O
this. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
also O
put O
in O
a O
civil O
claim O
for O
damages O
against O
the O
company O
which O
could O
give O
you O
significant O
compensation. O
You’ll O
probably O
need O
a O
lawyer O
to O
pursue O
a O
civil O
claim O
but O
may O
be O
able O
to O
get O
no O
win O
no O
fee. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
also O
get O
their O
security O
licences O
taken O
away. O
https://www.gov.uk/report-security-staff-or-companies O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Secondly O
assault. O
You O
roommate O
physically O
assaulted O
you. O
This O
is O
a O
crime. O
Go O
to O
the O
police O
and O
present O
whatever O
evidence O
you O
have. O
If O
you O
saved O
her O
TikToks O
admitting O
it O
it O
will O
be O
an O
open O
and O
shut O
case O
(though O
will O
still O
take O
a O
long O
time.) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Thirdly, O
damaging O
your O
stuff. O
This O
is O
criminal O
damage. O
Again O
go O
to O
the O
police O
with O
your O
evidence. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Lastly O
the O
reputational O
damage. O
You O
do O
have O
a O
case O
that O
you’ve O
been O
lied O
about O
and O
had O
your O
reputation O
damage O
however O
pursing O
such O
a O
case O
through O
the O
Courts O
would O
be O
very O
expensive O
for O
you O
and O
may O
be O
very O
difficult. O
My O
advice O
would O
be O
that O
once O
you O
go O
to O
the O
police O
you O
go O
on O
social O
media O
and O
tell O
your O
side O
of O
the O
story O
publicly. O
As O
long O
as O
you O
tell O
the O
truth O
there O
should O
be O
no O
legal O
problems O
for O
you O
in O
doing O
this. O
Name O
the O
people O
involved, O
name O
and O
shame O
the O
companies. O
Lots O
of O
people O
will O
believe O
you O
and O
sympathise O
with O
you. O
I O
instantly O
believed O
you. O
The O
higher O
ups O
at O
the O
company O
will O
probably O
investigate. O
Your O
roommate O
may O
attack O
you O
again O
but O
you O
will O
have O
defenders O
on O
your O
side O
now O
and O
she’s O
actually O
likely O
to O
say O
something O
that O
incriminates O
her O
again. O

I O
know O
that O
Pro O
Wrestling O
Illustrated O
still O
exists, O
because O
the O
PWI O
500 O
gets O
talked O
up O
on O
social O
media O
every O
year O
(if O
nothing O
else) O
but O
it's O
been O
a O
few O
years O
since O
I've O
actually O
seen O
one O
at O
a O
store O
(I O
think O
Walgreens O
was O
the O
last O
one?) O
I O
know O
it's O
not O
novel O
to O
say O
that O
print O
media's O
been O
in O
steep O
decline O
for O
awhile, O
so O
it's O
impressive O
that O
PWI O
is O
still O
around O
at O
all, O
but O
I O
was O
curious O
and O
figured O
someone O
on O
here O
probably O
still O
bought/read O
them O
semi-regularly. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
guess O
my O
main O
questions O
are: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
1. O
Is O
PWI O
the O
last O
one O
standing, O
or O
do O
they O
still O
publish O
other O
titles? O
As O
mentioned, O
I've O
seen O
PWI O
for O
sale O
at O
stores O
a O
few O
times O
in O
recent O
years, O
but O
I O
can't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
saw O
any O
other O
wrestling O
magazine. O
From O
the O
"Apter O
mags" O
family O
or O
otherwise. O
[SEP]
2. O
Do O
they O
still O
more O
or O
less O
try O
to O
keep O
kayfabe O
in O
their O
stories? O
I O
know O
on O
one O
hand O
that O
might O
seem O
foolish O
in O
the O
internet O
age, O
when O
there's O
probably O
no O
full-on O
"marks" O
left O
of O
any O
age, O
but O
if O
they O
can't O
compete O
with O
the O
internet O
(online O
dirtsheets O
included) O
in O
terms O
of O
news O
and O
up-to-the-minute O
commentary, O
I O
can O
see O
how O
they O
might O
decide O
to O
just O
pick O
a O
lane O
and O
keep O
up O
a O
winking O
suspension O
of O
disbelief. O

So O
I O
recently O
got O
the O
PWI O
500 O
magazine O
and O
I O
was O
rather O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase. O
I O
don’t O
know O
of O
other O
magazines O
really. O
But O
I O
liked O
the O
product O
enough O
that O
I O
bought O
a O
subscription. O

I O
live O
with O
my O
68 O
year O
old O
Great O
uncle O
who O
was O
following O
wrestling O
with O
his O
dad O
my O
great O
grandfather O
as O
kid O
reading O
the O
magazines O
and O
stuff. O
It O
did O
still O
present O
itself O
as O
a O
kayfabe O
magazine. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
the O
big O
reason O
for O
me O
I O
got O
it O
to O
connect O
with O
an O
old O
school O
fan. O
And O
it O
worked. O
We’re O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O
next O

[SEP]
Pretty O
sure O

is O
the O

it's O

[SEP]
Hi, O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I B-Location
lived I-Location
in I-Location
Missouri I-Location
some B-Time
time I-Time
ago I-Time
and O
made O
my O
internet O
payments O
directly O
through O
the O
landlord O
included O
in O
Rent O
since O
the O
internet O
was O
a O
bundle O
they O
had O
with O
ATT. O
Though O
the O
online O
account O
had O
my O
email O
and O
name, O
it O
always O
showed O
$0 O
and O
no O
usage O
as O
that O
was O
reported O
to O
my O
landlord. O
When O
I O
moved O
out, O
I O
asked O
my O
landlord O
if O
I O
was O
responsible O
for O
returning O
the O
equipment, O
or O
I O
leave O
it O
in O
the O
apartment O
for O
the O
next O
person, O
and O
they O
told O
me O
to O
leave O
it O
and O
they'll O
take O
care O
of O
it. O
I O
got O
notification O
months O
later O
from O
ATT O
saying O
that O
I O
didn't O
return O
my O
equipment. O
I O
called O
the O
landlord, O
they O
were O
going O
to O
return. O
Never O
did, O
so O
I O
got O
ATT O
sent O
the O
debt O
to O
a O
debt O
collection O
agency. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
TBH O
I O
have O
the O
money O
to O
pay O
this O
bill O
($\~170), O
but O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
debts O
that O
are O
not O
mine, O
since O
I O
was O
going O
to O
return O
the O
equipment O
initially. O
The O
apartment O
contract O
clearly O
stated O
that O
internet O
is O
through O
them, O
but O
I O
can O
be O
held O
liable O

Alright, O
friends--this O
is O
a O
doozy! O
My B-Relationship_Status
fiancé I-Relationship_Status
has I-Relationship_Status
been I-Relationship_Status
trying I-Relationship_Status
to I-Relationship_Status
break I-Relationship_Status
into I-Relationship_Status
a I-Relationship_Status
new I-Relationship_Status
field I-Relationship_Status
at I-Relationship_Status
nearly I-Relationship_Status

He's O
so O
smart O

he O
really O
doesn't O
have O
any O
professional O
career O

[SEP]

I O
overheard O
him O
talking O
to O
a O

and O
I'm O
starting O
to O
understand O
why O
he O
has O
been O
having O
trouble. O
He O
says O
"um" O
almost O
an O
awkward O
amount, O
but O
he O
doesn't O
even O
talk O
like O
that O
in O
real O
life. O
He O
also O
sounds O
incredibly O
stern O
and O
serious O
with O
none O
of O
his O
great O
and O
funny O
personality O
shining O
through. O
And, O
the O
worst O
part O
is O
that O
he O
is O
constantly O
smacking O
his O
lips! O
Like, O
where O
did O
that O
even O
come O
from?! O
It's O
like O
he O
becomes O
a O
different O
person O
when O
he's O

write O

that O
might O

that O
in O
a O

we O
would O

comfortable O

our O

Do O
you O

Hi. O
I’m O
like O
your O
fiancé O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
being O
interviewed. O
I O
can O
write O
a O
killer O
resume O
and O
cover O
letter, O
so O
I O
usually O
land O
an O
interview, O
but O
the O
don’t O
get O
offered O
the O
job. O
I O
am O
always O
SO O
NERVOUS O
when O
it O
comes O
time O
for O
the O
interview. O
I O
haven’t O
gone O
job O
hunting O
in O
years O
because O
of O
this O
fear O
and O
I O
don’t O
like O
my O
current O
job. O
I O
just O
don’t O
believe O
I O
can O
appear O
capable. O
Maybe O
this O
helps O
as O
a O
different O
perspective O
[SEP]
Offer O
to O
give O
him O
practice O
interviews O
[SEP]
Since O
you O
have O
expertise O
in O
the O
hiring O
process, O
I O
would O
casually O
offer O
him O
help O
practicing O
and/or O
tips. O
But O
I O
wouldn't O
mention O
"because O
I O
saw O
your O
interview O
and O
you O
are O
terrible", O
more O
like O
"since O
you O
are O
going O
through O
something O
I O
am O
knowledgeable O
in". O
[SEP]
It O
sounds O
like O
he O
has O
not O
asked O
for O
help. O
[SEP]
First O
of O
all O
does O
he O
think O
he O
has O
a O
problem? O
Second O
does O
he O
want O
help/get O
feedback O
so O
he O
recognizes O
he O
has O
a O
problem? O
Third, O
does O
he O
want O
help O
from O
you? O
[SEP]
Get O
the O
first O
question O
answered O
first. O
[SEP]
It O
sounds O
like O
he O
has O
anxiety. O
Lip O
smacking/mouth O
wetting O
is O
a O
sign O
of O
nervousness. O
Offer O
to O
do O
mock O
interviews O
with O
him. O
[SEP]
Interviewing O
is O
a O
skill O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
practiced O
to O
get O
good O
at O
it, O
just O
like O
any O
skill. O
There’s O
this O
interview O
technique O
called O
STAR O
that O
he O
needs O
to O
look O
up. O
It’s O
basically O
like, O
hey O
here’s O
an O
example O
of O
a O
situation O
I O
faced, O
how O
I O
faced O
it, O
and O
what O
the O
results O
were. O
If O
he O
has O
10 O
examples O
like O
this O
and O
practices/memorizes O
them, O
that O
will O
help O
a O
lot O
with O
his O
confidence. O
Also, O
he O
can O
look O
up O
the O
most O
common O
STAR O
interview O
questions O
and O
make O
sure O
he O
has O
examples O
for O
each O
one. O
I O
created O
a O
spreadsheet O
and O
read O
over O
it O
before O
any O
interview, O
just O
to O
center O
myself. O
For O
the O
non O
stop O
Ums, O
you O
might O
try O
recording O
him O
during O
an O
interview O
so O
he O
can O
actually O
hear O
himself. O
If O
you O
think O
this O
would O
backfire, O
he O
can O
put O
a O
little O
note O
next O
to O
his O
camera O
that O
says O
No O
Ums! O
I O
did O
this O
and O
it O
actually O
helps. O
The O
best O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
for O
him O
is O
help O
him O
with O
these O
different O
tricks O
so O
he O
gains O
confidence. O
See O
if O
he’ll O
do O
mock O
interviews O
with O
you O
that O
can O
can O
record O
so O
he O
can O
hear O
himself O
and O
work O
on O
fixing O
issues. O
[SEP]
I O
swear O
I O
could O
have O
written O
this O
post. O
My B-Relationship_Status
fiancé I-Relationship_Status
has I-Relationship_Status
been I-Relationship_Status
job I-Relationship_Status
hunting I-Relationship_Status
for I-Relationship_Status
months I-Relationship_Status
and I-Relationship_Status
has I-Relationship_Status
great I-Relationship_Status
experience I-Relationship_Status
in I-Relationship_Status
his I-Relationship_Status
field I-Relationship_Status
and I-Relationship_Status
a I-Relationship_Status
nice I-Relationship_Status
resume I-Relationship_Status
and I-Relationship_Status
he I-Relationship_Status
lands I-Relationship_Status
multiple I-Relationship_Status
interviews I-Relationship_Status
a I-Relationship_Status
week. I-Relationship_Status
But O
he O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
offered O
a O
position O
and O
I’m O
almost O
100% O
positive O
it’s O
because O
of O
how O
he O
comes O
across O
in O
interviews. O
He O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
interview O
anxiety O
but O
he O
tries O
too O
hard O
to O
play O
it O
cool O
and O
comes O
off O
as O
disinterested. O
I’ve O
tried O
to O
encourage O
him O
to O
show O
his O
personality O
and O
make O
an O
attempt O
to O
make O
a O
personal O
connection O
with O
the O
interviewer, O
but O
he O
says O
he O
likes O
his O
method. O
I’m O
trying O
so O
hard O
to O
not O
damage O
his O
confidence O
but O
he O
is O
also O
his O
own O
biggest O
problem O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
see O
a O
way O
for O
you O
to O
bring O
this O
up O
with O
your O
fiancé O
without O
knocking O
his O
confidence, O
and O
I O
think O
you O
should O
leave O
the O
overall O
topic O
alone O
until O
he O
potentially O
comes O
to O
you O
for O
feedback O
on O
his O
own O
initiative. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
he O
does O
come O
to O
you O
by O
himself, O
even O
if O
only O
to O
just O
vent O
about O
unsuccessful O
interviews, O
you O
can O
remind O
him O
of O
your O
hiring O
and O
managing O
experience O
and O
offer O
to O
go O
over O
his O
CV O
with O
him O
and O
give O
him O
some O
pointers O
for O
future O
interviews. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
However, O
even O
then, O
I O
think O
you O
should O
keep O
your O
observations O
to O
yourself O
and O
just O
offer O
good O
tips O
based O
on O
your O
own O
experience. O
I'm O
sure O
you O
mean O
well, O
but O
I O
don't O
think O
the O
rest O
is O
really O
for O
you O
to O
judge. O
You O
overheard O
him O
talking O
to O
an O
interview O
panel, O
but O
you O
probably O
weren't O
supposed O
to. O
You're O
not O
his O
hiring O
agent O
or O
manager. O
You're O
his O
girlfriend; O
your O
role O
in O
this O
constellation O
is O
different O
and O
your O
criticism O
would O
likely O
have O
an O
entirely O
different O
impact O
than O
you O
intend O
it. O
[SEP]
Offer O
to O
practice O
interviews O
with O
him. O
I O
failed O
at O
my O
first O
interview O
because O
no O
one O
told O
me O
how O
to O
interview O
and O
I O
was O
way O
too O
casual O
and O
familiar O
and O
nervous O
[SEP]
I’d O
say O
hey O
I O
saw O
a O
really O
great O
YouTube O
or O
TikTok O
about O
interviewing O
it O
made O
me O
think O
about O
your O
job O
hunt. O
Then O
1 O
give O
him O
some O
external O
resources, O
there O
a O
ton O
of O
great O
ones O
on O
YouTube. O
Then O
2 O
say O
they O
suggest O
roleplaying O
an O
interview O
and O
ask O
if O
he’d O
be O
interested O
in O
doing O
that O
with O
you. O
If O
he O
says O
no O
leave O
it O
alone O
if O
he O
says O
yes O
I’d O
role-play O
some O
of O
the O
open O
ended O
questions O
that O
are O
most O
typical O
and O
at O
the O
end O
ask O
if O
he’d O
like O
your O
feedback O
or O
constructive O
criticism O
then O
bring O
up O
the O
things O
you O
notice. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
think O
there’s O
anything O
wrong O
with O
helping O
your O
partner O
or O
wanting O
them O
to O
have O
their O
best O
qualities O
shine. O
My B-Relationship_Status

I I-Relationship_Status
have I-Relationship_Status
always I-Relationship_Status
helped I-Relationship_Status
each I-Relationship_Status
other I-Relationship_Status
study, I-Relationship_Status
done I-Relationship_Status
flash I-Relationship_Status
cards, I-Relationship_Status
role-played I-Relationship_Status

It’s O
so O
helpful O
to O
get O
out O
the O
nervous O
energy. O
[SEP]
Wait. O
You O
have O
experience O
in O
recruitment O
and O
didn’t O
even O
help O
him O
practice!? O
Wha? O
[SEP]
Help O
him O
practice. O
For O
my O
last O
job, O
I O
put O
in O
the O
work O
for O
the O
interview: O
googled O
common O
interview O
questions, O
and O
researched O
the O
company, O
and O
practiced O
the O
interview O
over O
the O
phone O
with O
friends O
and O
on O
camera. O
That’s O
what O
it O
takes. O
It O
isn’t O
that O
he O
lacks O
the O
skills O
as O
to O
why O
he O
isn’t O
getting O
hired O
it’s O
that O
he O
sounds O
really O
unprepared. O
[SEP]
He O
is O
your O

Eventually O
he'll O
be O
your O
husband. O
Just O
talk O
straight O
with O
him. O
It's O
not O
what O
you O
say. O
It's O

it. O
Keep O

Be O

him O
try O

If O
he O
vents O
about O
it O

expresses O
that O
it’s O

you O
can O

was O

you O
listened O
in. O

him O
it's O
from O

how O
to O
answer O
it. O
It's O
a O
great O
way O
to O
help O
him O
build O
confidence. O
[SEP]
He's O
trying O
to O
not O
get O
a O
job. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Jk. O
Idk.. O
But O
hope O
you O
figure O
it O
out O
because O
that's O
a O
delicate O
issue O
to O
try O
and O
address. O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
it's O
tough O
because O
I O
think O
most O
people O
get O
really O
nervous O
for O
interviews. O
To O
be O
honest, O
I O
have O
even O
taken O
a O
beta O
blocker O
beforehand O
because O
I O
was O
so O
jittery. O
Over O
the O
years, O
I've O
developed O
a O
running O
list O
of O
questions O
I've O
either O
been O
asked O
or O
anticipated O
being O
asked O
and O
the O
responses O
to O
gonwith O
them. O
I O
usually O
go O
over O
those O
about O
5 O
times, O
so O
I O
have O
them O
in O
my O
head O
but O
am O
not O
over O
rehearsed. O
I've O
even O
recorded O
myself O
asking O
the O
questions O
and O
filmed O
myself O
answering O
them O
to O
get O
used O
to O
it. O
I O
think O
you O
should O
go O
for O
it O
if O
you O
want O
to O
apply O
to O
other O
jobs! O
Each O
interview O
is O
practice O
so O
that O
even O
if O
you O
don't O
get O
a O
job, O
you're O
prepared O
when O
the O
right O
one O
comes O
along! O
[SEP]
It O
definitely O
takes O
practice O
to O
do, O
I O
usually O
have O
to O
rehearse O
my O
answers O
for O
it O
to O
come O
out O
smoothly. O
I O
have O
to O
do O
it O
every O
time O
otherwise O
I O
become O
awkward O
again O
lol! O
It O
definitely O
doesn't O
come O
naturally. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
can O
get O
someone O
to O
do O
practice O
interviews O
with O
you, O
they O
can O
be O
loads O
of O
help. O
(Though O
it O
always O
feels O
cringy O
lmao) O
[SEP]
There O
is O
a O
website O
called O
UNIVERSAL O
CLASS O
(free O
through O
public O
libraries) O
that O
has O
a O
course O
about O
job O
interviews. O
One O
whole O
lesson O
is O
about O
practicing O
for O
a O
job O
interview. O
[SEP]
This! O
You O
don't O
have O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
you O
actually O
saw/heard O
him. O
When O
he O
tells O
you O
that O
he O
wasn't O
hired O
after O
the O
interview O
give O
some O
general O
advice O
how O
to O
handle O
a O
job O
interview. O
And O
without O
him O
knowing O
address O
the O
problems O
he O
seems O
to O
be O
having O
[SEP]
Propanolol O
is O
actually O
being O
marketed O
on O
FB O
as O
a O
"performance O
" O
medication O
for O
interviews O
and O
public O
speaking. O
It's O
a O
beta O
blocker. O
I O
take O
it O
for O
tachycardia/rapid O
heartbeat. O
I O
mean O
it O
does O
lower O
your O
racing O
heart O
and O
that O
calms O
you. O
I O
think O
in O
his O
case O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
being O
out O
of O
practice O
in O
"selling O
himself." O
My O
exhusband O
had O
similar O
trouble O
decades O
ago O
when O
trying O
to O
switch O
fields. O
Years O
later O
after O
our O
divorce O
he O
YouTube O
researched O
"how O
to" O
interviews O
and O
common O
questions O
asked. O
He O
has O
now O
nailed O
several O
very O
very O
important O
awesome O

He's O
a O

at O

we're O

been O
that O
most O

pretty O
chill O
about O

[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
usually O
say O
something O

"uh, O

I O
follow O
up O
with O
"thank O

now O
they'd O
need O
to O

mostly O
they O
just O

only O

I O

spreading O

Take O

She O

They O
just O
let O

I O

I O
shorten O

I O

I O

It's O
gotten O
to O
the O
point O

pull O
so O
hard, O
that O
I O
have O
to O
yank O
on O
the O

to O
bring O

that O

even O
more. O

I O
carry O
my O
own O
training O
harnesses O
to O
manage O
dogs O
who O
have O
leash O
issues, O
including O
pulling. O
Just O
check O
with O
the O
owner O
that O
it’s O
ok O
to O
use O
your O
own O
harness O
- O
I O
use O
a O
PetSafe O
3-in-1 O
in O
three O
sizes. O
[SEP]
Get O
a O
harness O
with O
a O
front O
clip O
or O
a O
gentle O
leader O
(head O
collar.) O
You O
have O
to O
get O
owners O
approval. O
That O
will O
curb O
the O
bad O
habits O
quickly O
[SEP]
You O
got O
yourself O
and O
the O
dog O
into O
a O
feed O
back O
loop. O
You O
both O
are O
pulling O
each O
other O
more O
and O
more O
because O
you're O
both O
not O
getting O
what O
you O
need O
in O
the O
walk. O
The O
dog O
is O
pulling O
more O
and O
darting/lunging O
quicker O
because O
to O
them O
that's O
the O
only O
way O
to O
get O
more O
freedom. O
Less O
freedom O
for O
the O
dog O
doesn't O
mean O
less O
pulling O
and O
often O
it O
just O
means O
whoever O
is O
stronger O
pulls O
harder. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Walking O
right O
next O
to O
another O
entity, O
dog O
or O
human, O
isn't O
really O
natural O
for O
dogs. O
Roaming, O
zigzagging, O
and O
sniffing O
it O
how O
dogs O
naturally O
walk. O
And O
all O
thought O
those O
are O
often O
connected O
to O
pulling, O
pulling O
is O
not O
required O
for O
a O
dog O
to O
do O
those O
things. O
A O
dog O
can O
learn O
or O
be O
trained O
to O
walk O
in O
a O
heel O
position O
but O
that O
requires O
consistent O
association O
to O
reinforcement. O
Reinforcement O
can O
be O
many O
things, O
treats, O
access O
for, O
praise, O
removal O
of O
unpleasant O
stimuli, O
and O
or O
play O
(pre-mac O
principal.) O
There O
are O
benefits O
and O
downsides O
to O
different O
reinforcement O
methods. O
And O
it O
really O
depends O
what O
the O
dog O
cares O
about O
the O
most O
in O
the O
moment. O
If O
squirrels O
and O
smelling O
is O
way O
more O
important O
than O
treats O
using O
treats O
during O
walks O
is O
going O
to O
be O
inefficient. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Additionally O
dogs O
don't O
generalize O
training O
to O
different O
handlers O
easily. O
Even O
if O
the O
pet O
parents O
started O
training O
and O
were O
diligent, O
you O
would O
not O
see O
an O
effect O
for O
some O
time. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
recommendation O
and O
suggestion O
for O
you O
is O
to O
either O
decline O
walking O
them, O
or O
work O
on O
better O
walking O
communication O
between O
you O
and O
the O
dog. O
Not O
every O
dog O
works O
well O
with O
every O
persons O
walking O
style O
and O
vice O
versa. O
I O
would O
recommend O
looking O
into O
loose O
leash O
walking O
methods. O
I O
walk O
many O
dogs O
that O
just O
need O
a O
little O
more O
space O
to O
roam, O
safely, O
to O
then O
start O
actually O
paying O
attention O
to O
where O
I O
wanted O
to O
walk. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
a O
doggo O
like O
this O
and O
unfortunately O
has O
a O
pace O
maker O
so O
cannot O
use O
anything O
around O
his O
neck O
so O
he O
wears O
a O
harness. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
use O
a O
lead O
that O
has O
a O
little O
pull O
elastic O
in O
it, O
I O
think O
it’s O
a O
no O
pull O
lead. O
When O
we’re O
out O
walking O
I O
usually O
figure O
if O
8 O
back O
and O
forth O
up O
and O
down O
my O
garden. O
He O
is O
much O
better O
with O
me O
but O
because O
of O
his O
pace O
maker O
I’ve O
had O
to O
put O
in O
the O
work O
as O
I’m O
not O
as O
confident O
to O
let O
him O
pull. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Patience O
is O
a O
virtue O
unfortunately O
but O
perhaps O
make O
the O
owners O
aware O
of O
the O
harm O
it O
does O
to O
you O
physically O
also O
and O
how O
you O
don’t O
know O
if O
you O
can O
continue O
without O
some O
co O
operation. O
[SEP]
Like O
previous O
people O
have O
said O
try O
a O
harness O
with O
the O
owner's O
approval. O
Use O
treats. O
Get O
her O
attention O
on O
you O
before O
you O
go O
on O
the O
walk. O
Have O
her O
sit, O
look O
at O
you. O
Maybe O
do O
a O
few O
recalls, O
anything O
to O
kind O
of O
get O
her O
calmed O
down O
and O
more O
focused O
on O
you O
than O
the O
walk. O
Even O
if O
it's O
just O
for O
a O
moment O
it O
will O
help O
during O
the O
walk. O

Not O
sure O
how O
quickly O
the O
dog O
will O
learn, O
but O
with O
my O
clients O
who O
do O
this, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
pull O
too O
hard O
I O
stop O
walking O
completely. O
Usually O
the O
dog O
is O
like O
??? O
When O
there's O
slack O
we O
keep O
going. O
Most O
dogs O
figure O
it O
out O
enough O
that O
walking O
with O
me O
specifically O
+ O
pulling O
= O
not O
going O
anywhere. O
It's O
not O
a O
long O
term O
solution O
but O
it'll O
save O
you O
some O
pulled O
muscles. O
[SEP]
Get O
the O
lead O
that O
pulls O
from O
the O
front O
of O
the O
dog O
as O
others O
have O
mentioned. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Training O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O
repetition. O
Every O
time O
the O
dog O
pulls O
on O
the O
lead O
I O
stop. O
I O
walk O
forward O
when O
they O
are O
calm O
and O
praise O
them. O
If O
they O
pull O
again O
I O
stop. O
And O
again O
and O
again. O
You O
have O
to O
continue O
this O
even O
if O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
and O
they O
start O
to O
realise O
they O
don't O
go O
anywhere O
unless O
they O
stop O
pulling. O
But O
for O
the O
time O
restrictions O
of O
walking O
on O
Rover O
and O
your O
main O
purpose O
being O
to O
exercise O
the O
dog O
not O
train O
it, O
I O
would O
opt O
for O
the O
lead O
if O
the O
owners O
approve. O
[SEP]
I O
swear O
by O
Weiss O
walkie O
leashes. O
My O
own O
dogs O
are O
horrible O
pullers O
on O
walks O
and O
they O
still O
pull, O
but O
it O
does O
lessen O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
than O
any O
other O
leash O
we've O
tried. O
I O
use O
it O
on O
one O
of O
my O
regulars O
too O
(with O
permission) O
and O
she O
pulls O
so O
much O
less! O
[SEP]
Unfortunately, O
there's O
not O
a O
lot O
else O
you O
can O
do O
without O
the O
owner's O
approval. O
I O
would O
recommend O
having O
another O
very O
serious O
conversation O
with O
the O
owners O
where O
you O
essentially O
say, O
"Look, O
if O
you O
don't O
do O
something O
about O
this O
- O
such O
as O
hiring O
a O
trainer O
or O
purchasing O
tools O
like O
a O
prong O
collar O
- O
I O
will O
be O
terminating O
this O
relationship O
as O
it O
has O
gotten O
completely O
out O
of O
hand." O
And O
if O
they O
don't O
do O
anything, O
follow O
through O
on O
it O
and O
terminate O
the O
relationship. O
[SEP]
See O
if O
owners O
would O
be O
interested O
in O
getting O
a O
prong O
or O
gentle O
leader. O
I've O
seen O
the O
gentle O
leaders O
work O
magic O
with O
pullers! O
[SEP]
My B-Pet
dog I-Pet
used I-Pet
to I-Pet
pull I-Pet
and O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
helped O
was O
lots O
and O
lots O
of O
leash O
corrections. O
What O
I O
do O
is O
slightly O
tug O
the O
leash O
or O
just O
allow O
the O
dog O
to O
catch O
the O
end O
of O
the O
leash O
and O
then O
head O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction. O
Eventually O
she O
got O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
only O
way O
to O
actually O
move O
forward O
on O
the O
walk O
is O
to O
stay O
by O
me. O
I O
had O
to O
accept O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
might O
not O
get O
very O
far O
physically O
during O
the O
walk, O
but O
my O
dog O
is O
usually O
still O
pretty O
worn O
out O
from O
having O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
what O
she O
is O
doing. O
Overall O
it O
can O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
to O
break O
a O
pulling O
habit, O
but O
might O
be O
worth O
it O
in O
the O
long O
run O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
see O
the O
dog O
on O
a O
continual O
basis. O
[SEP]
I O
can O
handle O
her O
since O
she's O
a O
smaller O
dog, O
it's O
just O
the O
biggest O
issue O
for O
me O
is O
walking. O
One O
time, O
we O
passed O
by O
someone, O
and O
they O
said, O
"Who's O
walking O
who?" O
which O
was O
embarrassing. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
also O
sometimes O
doesn't O
listen, O
which O
is O
weird O
bc O
she O
used O
to O
be O
good O
abt O
it O
before. O
I'm O
not O
sure O
what's O
happened, O
maybe O
bc O
she's O
almost O
3, O
and O
these O
behaviors O
have O
set O
in O
with O
her O
owners, O
and O
I O
handle O
it O
differently. O
Our O
she O
doesn't O
like O
my O
style. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
told O
them O
she's O
not O
listening O
to O
me O
as O
much, O
and O
they O
just O
said O
it O
was O
weird O
since O
she O
listens O
to O
them. O
Maybe O
it's O
a O
respect O
thing? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
i O
see O
your O
point. O
I O
wonder O
if O
charging O
more O
would O
make O
it O
worth O
it. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
recommendation, O
I O
will O
see O
what O
they O
say. O
Her O
harness O
now O
has O
no O
front O
clip, O
so O
I O
think O
that O
also O
contributes. O
I O
always O
use O
the O
front O
clip O
with O
other O
dogs O
who O
pull O
or O
are O
leash O
aggressive. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you, O
I O
will O
talk O
to O
them. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
suggestion, O
I O
hadn't O
heard O
of O
loose O
leash O
walking. O
I O
will O
research O
and O
try O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
see O
the O
dog O
almost O
every O
month O
for O
housesitting. O
These O
ppl O
got O
a O
dog O
in O
covid, O
hadn't O
had O
a O
dog O
since O
they O
were O
young, O
and O
they'd O
only O
had O
cats. O
And O
it'd O
been O
like O
10 O
years O
since O
they O
had O
any O
pets. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
that O
everything's O
been O
lifted, O
they O
travel O
as O
often O
as O
they O
used O
to O
before O
the O
dog. O
Once O
or O
twice O
a O
month, O
for O
at O
least O
5 O
days. O
I'm O
currently O
almost O
done O
with O
a O
3-week O
stay. O
And O
they O
leave O
for O
another O
trip O
next O
week O
🙃 O
[SEP]
[SEP]
They O
canceled O
two O
long O
trips O
next O
year O
bc O
they're O
realizing O
they O
don't O
want O
to O
leave O
their O
dog O
so O
often... O
it's O
the O
classic O
covid O
dog O
issues O
that O
we O
all O
hear O
and O
read O
abt. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
the O
jumping O
when O
on O
walks O
omg. O
I've O
walked O
other O
dogs O
in O
their O
neighborhood, O
and O
when O
I O
come O
across O
them, O
sue O
jumps O
to O
see O
me, O
and O
the O
owners O
barely O
stop O
it. O
I O
always O
try, O
and O
they O
get O
the O
hint O
to O
stop O
her. O

Know O
your O

girl. O
I O
think O
we O
have O
all O
gone O
through O
a O
phase O
of O
really O
horrible O
dogs O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
building O
up O

lol. O
Growing O
your O

also O
means O
making O
hard O
choices O
that O
will O
put O

ahead O
not O

What O
if O
that O
really O
well O
trained O
Labrador O
down O
the O
street O
needs O
walking O
while O
you're O
waisting O
time O
with O
Little O
Miss O
Yanks O
My O
Arm O
Off? O
It's O
hard O
to O
let O
go O
of O
bad O
relationships O
but O
you O
would O
be O
making O
way O
for O
better O
business O
opportunities. O
It's O
that O
or O
up O
the O
rate O
to O
make O
it O
worth O
your O
while. O
The O
whole O
point O
of O
Rover O
is O
the O
ability O
to O
do O
what O
you O
love. O
Good O
luck! O

Omg O
I O
walk O
a O
dog O
with O
a O
front O
clip O
harness O
and O
he O
will O
use O
it O
to O
drag O
me O
*backward*. O
He’s O
not O
obese O
since O
I’ve O
been O
walking O
him O
almost O
daily O
for O
a O
few O
months, O
so O
he’s O
not O
as O
bad O
now, O
but O
trust O
me O
when O
I O
say: O
any O
lead O
can O
suck O
with O
the O
wrong O
dog! O
😂 O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
currently O
doing O
drop O
ins O
with O
a O
9 O
month O
old O
puppy O
who O
wasn’t O
trained O
(so O
much O
biting O
and O
jumping O
and O
pulling O
at O
the O
meet O
and O
greet) O
and O
after O
the O
first O
drop-in, O
I O
brought O
my O
dog’s O
extra O
Halti O
(like O
a O
gentle O
leader), O
because O
this O
puppy’s O
normal O
collar O
fits O
weird O
(it O
slides O
down O
her O
neck O
and O
gives O
her O
a O
lot O
of O
leverage O
to O
choke O
herself O
😞). O
She O
clearly O
hated O
it O
at O
first, O
but O
wow, O
so O
much O
less O
pulling, O
because O
it’s O
easier O
to O
get O
her O
to O
notice O
with O
even O
a O
little O
tension O
at O
the O
top O
of O
her O
neck O
(that’s O
the O
most O
important O
thing), O
and O
she’ll O
let O
up O
on O
the O
leash. O
If O
I O
had O
a O
slip O
lead, O
I’d O
prefer O
that O
for O
her O
(the O
portion O
around O
her O
muzzle O
annoys O
her, O
and O
she O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
train, O
so O
she O
really O
just O
needs O
biofeedback—even O
a O
martingale O
collar O
would O
do O
wonders), O
but O
I O
don’t O
recommend O
slip O
leads O
to O
everyone, O
because O
there’s O
a O
steep O
learning O
curve O
(though O
I O
really O
like O
them O
as O
a O
general O
use O
training O
leash). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
best O
advice O
I O
have O
that O
isn’t O
tool-based O
(because O
imo, O
people O
do O
expect O
too O
much O
from O
the O
tool O
vs O
how O
you O
use O
it): O
pull O
up, O
not O
back, O
on O
the O
leash O
for O
pullers. O
You O
want O
better O
biofeedback O
for O
pullers, O
and O
that O
means O
higher O
on O
the O
neck—both O
safer O
for O
them O
and O
less O
annoying O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
Or O
you O
can O
just O
say O
you’re O
more O
comfortable O
using O
a O
harness O
and O
just O
make O
sure O
it O
has O
a O
front O
clip. O
A O
gentle O
leader O
will O
require O
way O
more O
training O
bc O
the O
dogs O
hate O
wearing O
it O
on O
their O
head O
in O
the O
beginning O
and O
most O
owners O
will O
think O
the O
head O
collar O
is O
hurting O
their O
pet(from O
my O
experience.) O
[SEP]
Yep O
I O
am O
very O
familiar O
with O
Covid O
puppies! O
Loose O
leash O
walking O
is O
a O
broad O
term O
and O
there O
are O
different O
styles. O
But O
the O
main O
factor O
is O
the O
leash O
is O
not O
what's O
controlling O
the O
dog. O
The O
leash O
is O
just O
a O
secondary O
safety. O
[SEP]
Covid O
puppies O
are O
prone O
to O
overstimulation O
or O
over O
arousal O
that O
causes O
zoomies O
and O
over O
excitement O
behavior. O
Doing O
a O
snaifari, O
decompression, O
or O
mental O
exercise O
is O
really O
good O
for O
them. O
Here O
is O
a O
video O
of O
a O
sniffari. O
(I O
am O
not O
familiar O
with O
this O
company/group. O
Literally O
just O
did O
a O
search O
for O
sniffari O
example.) O

You O
don't O
have O
to O
have O
a O
long O
leash O
it O
just O
has O
to O
be O
long O
enough O
that O
it O
doesn't O
get O
tight O
when O
they O
are O
roaming. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Additionally O
if O
you O
see O
them O
do O
these O
signs O
https://cattledogpublishing.com/product/body-language-of-fear-in-dogs/ O
and O
or O
shakeouts, O
their O
behavior O
maybe O
from O
stress, O
or O
over O
stimulation. O
[SEP]
Oh, O
completely O
agree. O
They O
likely O
wouldn't O
even O
get O
a O
herm-springer O
or O
a O
properly O
fitted O
prong. O
[SEP]
Thanks. O
I O
appreciate O
the O
comment. O
My O
sister O
said O
the O
same O
thing O
lol. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It's O
surprising O
bc O
she's O
been O
good O
before, O
so O
I O
assume O
it's O
the O
owners O
that O
have O
either O
encouraged O
whatever O
behavior O
(their O
neighbor O
said O
hi O
but O
she O
didn't O
want O
the O
dog O
to O
come O
to O
her O
bc O
[owner] O
can't O
control O
her O
when O
she O
jumps), O
or O
the O
dog O
just O
doesn't O
like O
me O
as O
kuch O
as O
before. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You're O
right O
tho, O
I O
have O
been O
picking O
up O
more O
business O
that O
is O
closer O
to O
where O
I O
live, O
and O
these O
ppl O
are O
further O
away. O
It O
sucks O
driving O
more O
than O
I'd O
like. O
[SEP]
The O
video O
you O
posted O
is, O
at O
the O
very O
least, O
from O
an O
certified O
fear-free O
trainer O
and O
behavior O
consultant. O
Her O
information O
is O
right O
in O
line O
with O
other O
such O
accredited O
professionals. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
most O
regular O
client O
was O
a O
puller. O
In O
addition O
to O
loose O
leash O
walking O
training O
I O
also O
got O
permission O
from O
her O
owner O
to O
use O
a O
long O
line O
for O
her O
walks. O
Now O
that O
she O
gets O
to O
spend O
50-75% O
of O
her O
walks O
making O
her O
own O
choices O
and O
smelling O
just O
about O
anything O
she O
wants O
her O
owner O
has O
told O
me O
she's O
become O
a O
loose O
leash O
champ O
when O
being O
walked O
by O
her O
family O
(this O
is O
still O
a O
relative O
term, O
she O
still O
pulls O
sometimes, O
but O
far O
less O
than O
she O
used O
to). O
She's O
still O
on O
a O
front-clip O
harness O
unless O
we're O
in O
a O
big O
open O
area, O
otherwise O
I O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
active O
management O
of O
the O
long O
line. O
My O
gear O
is O
a O
15' O
biothane O
long O
line O
by O
Viper, O
which O
stays O
stink-free O
and O
has O
durable O
brass O
hardware. O
[SEP]
As O
someone O
who O
has O
had O
to O
educate O
clients O
on O
prongs, O
they O
definitely O
won't. O
I O
worked O
with O
a O
trainer O
using O
one O
for O
my O
husky O
mix O
who O
was O
a O
notorious O
puller O
so O
I O
know O
my O
way O
around O
them. O
Had O
one O
lab O
drag O
its O
owner O
across O
my O
front O
yard O
when O
getting O
dropped O
off O
the O
first O
time, O
the O
prong O
was O
a O
necklace. O
Loose O
and O
down O
around O
the O
base O
of O
the O
neck, O
not O
doing O
a O
damn O
thing. O
Thankfully O
he O
was O
receptive O
on O
pick-up O
when O
I O
offered O
to O
show O
him O
how O
to O
properly O
fit O
it, O
and O
where O
it O
should O
rest, O
etc. O
When O
she O
was O
dropped O
off O
the O
next O
time O
it O
was O
still O
correctly O
fitted! O
Though O
she O
still O
dragged O
him O
across O
the O
yard....because O
he O
had O
switched O
to O
using O
a O
flexi-lead O
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) O
There's O
only O
so O
much O
I'm O
willing O
to O
put O
the O
energy O
into O
fixing O
and O
since O
this O
dog O
was O
happy O
with O
just O
yard O
time O
I O
let O
it O
go. O

Enrollment O
on O
Arrival O
at O
JFK O
Terminal O
5 O
[SEP]
After O
6 O
months O
of O
waiting, O
I O
finally O
got O
my O
conditional O
approval O
email O
yesterday O
12/1. O
It O
is O
perfect O
timing O
because O
I O
have O
an O
upcoming O
Mexico O
trip O
later O
next O
week O
and O
I B-Location
will I-Location
arrive I-Location
at I-Location
JFK I-Location
Terminal I-Location
5 I-Location
on B-Time
12/13. I-Time
[SEP]
I O
hope O
I O
can O
utilize O
Enrollment O
on O
Arrival O
but O
just O
in O
case O
no O
officer O
is O
available O
or O
in O
some O
other O
rare O
situation, O
I O
also O
secured O
an O
interview O
appointment O
at O
JFK O
for O
mid-January. O
[SEP]
Would O
it O
be O
an O
issue O
when O
I O
do O
my O
enrollment O
on O
arrival O
and O
the O
officer O
see O
that O
I O
have O
another O
appointment O
for O
later? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
guess O
in O
the O
worst O
case, O
I O
can O
just O
cancel O
my O
appointment O
right O
on O
the O
spot. O
[SEP]
No O
it O
won’t O
be O
an O
issue. O
If O
you O
manage O
to O
do O
EoA O
the O
appointment O
gets O
cancelled O
once O
you’re O
approved. O
At O
least O
that’s O
what O
the O
agent O
told O
me O
when O
I O
did O
EoA O
back O
in O
September O
at O
SEA O
but O
also O
had O
an O
appointment O
for O
later O
on O
if O
I O
hadn’t O
been O
able O
to O
do O
EoA. O

lucky O
me, O
I O
found O
a O
last O
min O
appointment O
on O
12/4 O
morning, O
I O
went O
to O
JFK O
terminal O
4 O
for O
the O
interview, O
the O
officer O
only O
asked O
"How O
did O
you O
get O
your O
permanent O
residence O
card" O
"where O
do O
you O
work O
now" O
"have O
you O
ever O
been O
arrested" O
then O
they O
gave O
me O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
with O
my O
KTN O
on O
it. O
[SEP]
20 O
mins O
later, O
i O
got O
email O
saying O
my O

[SEP]

Does O
MS O
refer O

If O
that's O
the O
case, O
well, O
I'll O
be O
more O
willing O
to O
consider O
an O
email O
pen O
pal. O
I O
still O
like O
pen O

you O

Yes, O
MS O
refers O
to O
multiple O
sclerosis O
however, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
better O
if O
I O
put O
that O
down O
so O
thanks O
for O
asking. O
I O
am O
still O

and O
there O
may O
be O
a O
way O
where O
we O
can O
both O
get O

I O
may O

I'm O
new O

I O
believe O
you O
can O
send O

via O
this O
program O
by O
clicking O
the O
person's O
name. O
After O
you O
click O
their O
name O
there O
should O
be O
an O
option O
to O
send O
a O

If O
this O
doesn't O
work, O
I'm O
not O
sure O
of O
any O
other O
ways O
to O
communicate O
privately. O
Chat O
is O
another O
option; O
however, O
I O
do O
not O
use O
the O
function. O
I O
do O
not O
communicate O
outside O
of O
this O

[SEP]
So O
how O
do O
we O
want O
to O
do O
this? O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
take O
it O
to O
PM? O
I’m O
assuming O
your O
email O
is O
the O
one O
used O
with O
your O
Reddit O
account. O
So O
do O
you O
want O
to O
write O
first O
or O
should O
I? O
[SEP]
Sea, O
I O
did O
try O
sending O
you O
an O
email O
message, O
but O
you O
have O
them O
turned O
off. O
Soon O
I O

have O
a O

set O
up O
since O
I'm O

many O

perhaps O
that O

why O
not O

It O
would O
be O

that O

any O

I O
live O

it's O
not O
worth O

from O
those O

they O
take O

Because O
some O

buy O

greater O

low O

their O

I O
have O
experienced O
this. O
The O
word O
for O
it O
is O
codependency O
if O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
accept O
that O
label. O
I've O
often O
wondered O
the O
same O
about O
my O
preferences, O
but O
it O
goes O
deeper O
than O
that. O
It's O
looking O
for O
feedback O
and O
emotional O
healing O
from O
those O
around O
you O
rather O
than O
trusting O
yourself. O
Could O
have O
a O
lot O
to O
do O
with O
self-esteem, O
trauma O
and O
emotional O
abuse O
like O
in O
my O
case O
or O
you O
could O
have O
completely O
different O
causes. O
My O
point O
is, O
find O
out O
what O
those O
things O
are O
and O
address O
them. O
This O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
thing O
to O
work O
on, O
but O
you O
can O
do O
it. O
There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
materials, O
books, O
and O
groups O
around O
these O
issues. O
If O
you O
need O
direct O
links, O
just O
ask. O
Hoping O
everything O
works O
out O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
You're O
not O
alone. O
[SEP]
I O
feel O
a O
similar O
way O
too, O
I've O
called O
them O
my O
"best O
friend O
in O
phases O
of O
my O
life" O
they O
were O
people O
I O
stuck O
with O
because O
I O
liked O
them, O
I O
liked O
them O
so O
much O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
more O
like O
them. O
I O
ended O
up O
basing O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
likes, O
opinions O
and O
personality O
based O
on O
them. O
It O
feels O
like O
I O
don't O
really O
have O
an O
original O
thought O
and O
I'm O
constantly O
changing O
based O
on O
who O
I'm O
with. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
I O
think O
that's O
just O
a O
part O
of O
being O
human, O
we O
grow O
up O
depending O
on O
one O
another O
to O
figure O
things O
out, O
we O
end O
up O
mimicking O
things O
others O
do O
and O
pouring O
hours O
into O
similar O
hobbies O
that O
they O
like. O
It O
becomes O
sort O
of O
a O
nurtured O
hobby O
I O
guess? O
But O
I O
think O
it's O
all O
a O
part O
of O
discovering O
things O
you O
like?? O
And O
aspects O
of O
others O
that O
you O
resonante O
with? O
I O
think O
who O
we O
are O
as O
individuals O
is O
a O
mix O
of O
all O
the O
people O
were O
close O
to O
and O
attach O
ourselves O
to. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don't O
think O
you're O
crazy, O
I O
can O
relate O
to O
the O
anxiety O
of O
people O
not O
liking O
you O
and O
the O
paranoia O
of O
the O
world O
hating O
you. O
It O
sucks, O
but O
there O
are O
people O
around O
you O
who O
are O
obviously O
supporting O
you O
(like O
your O
mom O
and O
siblings,) O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
start O
a O
journey O
of O
being O
less O
dependant O
then O
I O
think O
you O
can O
talk O
to O
them O
about O
it O
and O
let O
them O
guide O
you O
(counterintuitive O
bc O
you O
need O
to O
depend O
on O
them O
to O
help O
you O
be O
more O
independent O
but O
I O
think O
it's O
okay) O
[SEP]
Whilst O
there's O
a O
lot O
to O
say, O
perhaps O
this O
may O
help O
most. O
You O
say O
you O
put O
everything O
into O
one O
person, O
make O
that O
person O
yourself. O
It's O
your O
life O
and O
you're O
living O
with O
yourself O

the O
end, O
no O
one O

be O
doing O

Awesome! O
Same! O
I O
think O
DID O
is O
unlikely O
just O
statistically. O
I O
definitely O
qualify O
for O
a O
dissociative O
diagnosis O
though, O
which O
maybe O
you O
have O
experienced. O
That O
includes O
flashbacks O
and O
out O
of O
body O
experiences O
or O
a O
state O
of O
complete O
confusion O
where O
you O
can't O
center O
yourself O
in O
your O
identity O
and O
whether O
reality O
is O
present O
or O
you're O
in O
a O
dream. O
For O
me O
that O
part O
can O
be O
really O
scary. O
I'm O
saying O
all O
this O
because O
working O
on O
my O
codependency O
has O
really O
helped O
with O
the O
anxiety O
that O
causes O
a O
cascading O
effect O
of O
other O
symptoms. O
I O
hope O
that O
information O
is O
helpful O
and O
you O
feel O
supported. O
Hopefully O
some O

as O
well. O

He O
came O
home O
yesterday O
not O
feeling O
well, O
had O
a O
temp O
of O
101.7 O
and O
there O
was O
swelling O
near O
the O
back O
of O
his O
right O
jaw O
and O
under O
his O
right O
ear. O
This O
morning, O
still O
had O
a O
temp O
of O
101, O
swelling, O
and O
complained O
of O
ear O
pain- O
started O
him O
back O
on O
amoxicillin O
last O
night O
(new O
script O
from O
an O
NP O
I O
work O
with). O
Gave O
him O
Tylenol O
around O
7am O
today, O
no O
fever O
or O
pain O
as O
of O
now O
(3pm), O
but O
that O
area O
is O
swollen, O
red O
l, O
and O
warm O
to O
the O
touch. O
He O
said O
his O
teeth O
don't O
hurt O
at O
all O
and O
he O
just O
had O
a O
dental O
check O
up O
3 O
weeks O
ago. O
Was O
going O
to O
wait O
until O
tomorrow O
to O
see O
how O
it O
is O
before O
we O
rank O
up O
more O
bills O
at O
urgent O
care, O
but O
I'm O
worried O
about O
the O
swelling. O
Could O
this O
be O
caused O
by O
an O
ear O
infection O
or O
more O
serious, O
like O
something O
residual O
from O
strep? O
He O
is O
fully O
vaccinated, O
was O
panicking O
about O
mumps O
when O
I O
first O
saw O
him O
yesterday. O

now, O
I B-Health

it’s O
not O
majorly O
bad O
or O
anything. O
It O
only O
affections O
certain O
spots O
on O
my O
body O
and O
comes O
and O
goes. O
So O
sometimes O
it’s O
basically O
gone O
and O

im O
like O
a O

[SEP]
[SEP]
lately, O
it’s O
been O
bad, O
getting O
worse, O
the O
main O
places O
are O
on O

right O
in O

my O

(And O
my O

I B-Appearance

my I-Appearance

on I-Appearance

im O

when O
me O

it O
was O

now O
it’s O

I O
straight O
up O
avoid O

I O

Buffalo O
Trace O
for O
a O
total O
of O
$50 O
on O

I O
bought O
a O
little O
bottle O
of O
Jim O

to O
sneak O
into O
a O
concert. O
[SEP]
I'd O
guess O
about O
$1000- O
$1200 O
[SEP]
I'd O
guess O
about O
$2K. O
Most O
of O
these O
were O
hard O

I O
am O

the O
fifth O
on O
this O
one O
[SEP]
About O
3k. O
But O
half O
of O
that O
is O
because O
I O
buy O
for O
my O
neighborhood O
cigar O
and O
bourbon O
group O
which O
spends O
about O
$150 O
a O
month O
on O
cigars O
and O
$150 O
on O
cigars. O
[SEP]
Probably O
$300 O
or O
so O
for O
myself O
and O
$150 O
in O
gifted O
bottles. O
If O
we’re O
talking O
booze O
in O
general O
that O
number’s O
gonna O
be O
sufficiently O
higher. O
[SEP]
Probably O
only O
about O
$400-500. O
Of O
course, O
that’s O
conveniently O

our O

to O

but O
I’d O
rather O
not O

that. O

I O
started O

a O

more O

I O
could O

bourbons. O
A O

Rowan’s, O

easily O
over O
1k O
closer O
to O
2k O
this O

And O
probably O
$150 O
a O

on O

So O
maybe O
23 O
… O
aim O

Around O
6-7k O

A O

a O

I O
just O

some O

them. O
[SEP]
Between O
$1K O
- O
2K. O
Hell, O
the O
one O

of O
KC O

was O
close O
to O
$200 O
after O

[SEP]
I’m O
not O

exactly O
the O

especially O
if O

I’d O

3-4K O

[SEP]
If O

At O

10-15k O

somewhere O

🤷🏻‍♂️ O
There O

out O

so O
that O
factors O

[SEP]
Enough O
to O
make O
a O

to O
only O
bring O

from O
my O

in O

[SEP]
Did O
you O
by O

30,000 O
of O
a O

[SEP]
Do O
those O

[SEP]
Have O

[SEP]
Damn O
you O

[SEP]
$5k O
in O
a O

If O
I O
was O
to O

around O
40-50 O
bottles? O
[SEP]
Maybe O
two O
fifths. O
I O

no O
more O
than O
three O

Or O
four(ty) O
[SEP]
60k O

[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
a O
guy O
who O
had O
collection O
of O
open O
and O
unopened O
bottles O
worth O
$75k. O
But O
that O
was O
over O
10 O
years O
of O
buying. O
I O
am O
sure O
this O
dude O
maybe O
drinking O
close O
to O
$10k O
in O
a O
year O
since O
his O
avg O
bottle O
price O
was O
around O
$150. O
[SEP]
That’s O
right, O
it’s O
all O
relative. O
It’s O
all O
relative. O
It’s O
all O
relative. O
[SEP]
Unless O
you O
spent O
$2k O
that O
month O
I’m O
pretty O
sure O
you O
lucked O
out O
on O
a O
glitch O
in O
the O
system O
[SEP]
Yes O
I O
bought O
in O
October O
but O
I O
didn't O
see O
a O
bump O
like O
that O
[SEP]
Nah O
their O
point O
system O
is O
wack. O
They O
do O
Pappy O
and O
BTAC O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year. O
I O
believe O
OFBB. O
Not O
sure O
what O
the O
other O
2 O
drawings O
are. O
I O
know O
you O
can O
randomly O
be O
selected O
to O
purchase O
blantons O
but O
everything O
else O
is O
thrown O
on O
the O
shelf O
so O
it’s O
all O
about O
being O
at O
the O
right O
place O
at O
the O
right O

They O
put O
out O
OWA, O
EHT, O
Stagg O
Picks O
over O
the O
last O
few O
months O
at O
our O
location. O
[SEP]
Probably O
somewhere O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
but O
my O
per O
bottle O
got O
a O
bit O
higher O
this O
year O
as O
well. O
Glenmorangie O
signet, O
MWND, O
Bardstown O
Discovery, O
etc. O
[SEP]
That’s O
a O

IRL O
[SEP]
Nah O
they O
have O
2x, O
5x, O
and O
10x O
on O
points O
that O
month. O
Didn’t O
pay O
attention O
but O
mostly O
bourbon, O
seasonal O
beers, O
and O
wine O
bought. O
Probably O
spent O
$400 O
in O
bourbon O
only. O
[SEP]
Bardstown O
is O
a O
cool O
story. O
I O
stopped O
by O

just O
recently O
for O

Good O
on O
you O
for O

out O
for O
your O
coworkers, O
any O
time O
management O
tries O
to O
discourage O
you O
from O
talking O
about O
your O
wages O
its O
a O
sign O
that O
*you O
need O
to O
start O
talking O
about O
them O
asap.* O
It's O
the O
only O
way O
to O
uncover O
and O
address O
things O
like O
say O
systemic O
racism O
in O
your O
company's O
hiring O
system O
leading O
to O
specific O
ethnicities O
getting O
lower O

You O
can't O
figure O
that O
out O
unless O
the O
workers O
talk O
to O
each O
other O
and O
find O
the O
pattern. O
[SEP]
You O

it’s O

[SEP]
We O
had O
good O
chuckle O
about O
the O
"sexism" O
in O
my O
office O
the O
other O
day. O
Every O
male O
who O
works O
for O
the O
company O
has O
a O
company O
truck. O
None O
of O
the O
females O
have O
any O
kind O
of O
company O
vehicle O
at O
all. O
Seems O
sexist O
on O
the O
surface. O
But O
we O
are O
an O
industrial O
service O
company O
and O
every O
technician O
is O
male O
(literally O
never O
had O
a O
female O
apply O
for O
a O
tech O
position). O
Every O
office O
support O
person O
is O
female, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
president O
of O
the O
company. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Just O
because O
you O
uncover O
a O
"pattern" O
doesn't O
mean O
there O
isn't O
a O
legitimate O
reason O
for O
it. O
There O
may O
be O
illegitimate O
reasons, O
and O
those O
should O
be O
addressed. O
But O
don't O
be O
too O
quick O
to O
jump O
to O
conclusions. O
[SEP]
If O
they O
only O
hire O
men O
as O
technicians, O
and O
only O
hire O
women O
as O
office O
workers, O
that O
is O
most O
definitely O
a O
strong O
sign O
of O
a O
sexist O
hiring O
pattern. O
What O
legitimate O
reason O
is O
there O
for O
that? O
There O
are O
strong O
gender O
biases O
in O
both O
professions O
but O
an O
unbiased O
hiring O
process O
would O
reflect O
the O
actual O
gender O
percentages O
of O
the O
professions, O
not O
an O
absolute O
monolith. O
For O
both O
professions O
it's O
about O
75% O
dominated O
by O
one O
gender, O
so O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
25% O
of O
applicants O
that O
are O
the O
"wrong" O
gender? O
Why O
do O
they O
not O
make O
up O
25% O
of O
your O
workforce? O
[SEP]
Now, O
I O
once O
flunked O
algebra O
in O
high O
school… O
but O
how O
do O
you O
hire O
women O
when O
100% O
of O
your O
applicants O
are O
male? O
[SEP]
You O
don't, O
but O
again, O
25% O
of O
technicians O
are O
women. O
If O
you O
get O
zero O
female O
applicants O
for O
a O
technician O
position O
rather O
than O
25% O
that O
indicates O
a O
bias O
in O
the O
hiring/application O
process O
or O
perhaps O
some O
kind O
of O
external O
factor O
like O
a O
poor O
company O
reputation. O
This O
isn't O
so O
bad O
in O
its O
own O
and O
might O
just O
be O
random O
coincidence O
but O
not O
when O
it O
happens O
twice O
in O
one O
workplace. O
That's O
pushing O
the O
bounds O
of O
believability. O
Note O
also O
that O
he O
only O
specifies O
that O
for O
the O
technician O
position- O
men O
*do* O
apply O
for O
office O
positions, O
but O
don't O
ever O
get O
hired. O
Why O
could O
that O
be? O
When O
this O
is O
a O
company-wide O
problem O
rather O
than O
a O
departmental O
one O
that O
points O
to O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
company O
culture, O
likely O
sexism. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Overall, O
just O
weird O
to O
notice O
the O
issue O
but O
laugh O
it O
off O
instead O
of O
pursuing O
it O
further. O
[SEP]
Yeah.... O
If O
I O
had O
one O
female O
applicant O
for O
a O
tech O
position, O
she O
would O
be O
given O
the O
same O
consideration O
as O
a O
male O
applicant. O
This O
isn't O
a O
phenomenon O
isolated O
to O
one O
company. O
I've B-Occupation
been I-Occupation
in I-Occupation
the I-Occupation
industrial I-Occupation
service I-Occupation
industry I-Occupation
my B-Time
entire I-Time
adult I-Time
life I-Time
(I'm B-Age
41, I-Age
so O
that's B-Occupation
about I-Occupation
23 I-Occupation
years I-Occupation
in I-Occupation
the I-Occupation
industry) I-Occupation
and O
have O
worked O
for O
a O
number O
of O
different O
companies, O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
country. O
It's O
the O
same O
everywhere. O
Females O
tend O
not O
to O
apply O
for O
Technician O
positions. O
The O
strange O
this O
is O
(or O
maybe O
not O
so O
stramge) O
that O
this O
disparity O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
bother O
the O
female O
support O
staff O
we O
have. O
They O
are O
not O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
concerned O
with O
the O
lack O
of O
female O
representation O
amongst O
the O
service O

The O
only O
people O
concerned O
are O
outside O
the O

which O
really O
baffles O
me. O

struggle O
rapper O
with O
his O
mixtapes; O
how O
would O
I O
gain O
more O
readers O
in O
a O
natural, O
acceptable O
and O
tolerable O
way O
without O
being O
annoying? O

You O
can O
join O
Discord O
servers, O
subreddits O
or O
other O
communities O
for O
fanfic O
readers O
and O
writers O
in O
the O
fandom. O
Pay O
attention O
to O
any O
requests O
people O
might O
make O
(i.e. O
"I O
want O
to O
read O
about O
X O
character"), O
and O
share O
your O
work O
if O
it O
fits O
the O
request. O
Talk O
about O
what O
you're O
writing O
if O
it's O
appropriate O
to O
the O
conversation. O
However, O
you O
should O
obviously O
engage O
with O
other O
people O
in O
the O
community O
for O
purposes O
other O
than O
self-promotion. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
it's O
normal O
for O
your O
motivation O
to O
fluctuate O
with O
your O
engagement O
levels. O
It O
doesn't O
make O
you O
weak O
or O
inferior O
to O
writers O
who O
don't O
care O
as O
much O
about O
external O
validation. O
[SEP]
There O
are O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
you O
can O
do O
that O
aren't O
super O
in O
your O
face. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
first O
the O
more O
sites O
you O
post O
on O
the O
more O
folks O
can O
read O
your O
work O
but O
it O
can O
bug O
you O
if O
your O
wanting O
all O
your O
readers O
centralized O
in O
one O
spot. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Second O
talk O
about O
your O
fic O
in O
appropriate O
context, O
fandom O
discussions O
about O
fanfic, O
on O
your O
social O
media O
and O
participate O
in O
review O
exchanges O
and O
other O
things O
designed O
for O
drumming O
up O
interest O
on O
this O
and O
other O
subs. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Three O
be O
active O
in O
your O
fandom O
by O
reviewing O
and O
interacting O
with O
others O
fics. O
Don't O
shill O
your O
own O
fic O
that's O
just O
irritating O
but O
the O
fact O
you O
interacted O
will O
often O
lead O
to O
folks O
clicking O
your O
user O
name O
to O
see O
what O
you O
have O
written O
and O
some O
of O
them O
will O
probably O
be O
interested. O
[SEP]
Best O
way O
is O
to O
interact O
with O
other O
people O
in O
your O
fandom, O
and O
to O
share O
your O
stories O
in O
spaces O
that O
are O
yours, O
or O
where O
advertising O
is O
allowed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Post O
about O
it O
on O
your O
social O
media O
and O
tag O
correctly O
based O
on O
the O
rules O
for O
whatever O
platform O
you're O
using. O
That O
isn't O
seen O
as O
annoying, O
because O
you O
are O
allowed O
to O
post O
whatever O
content O
to O
your O
own O
blog, O
as O
long O
as O
you're O
doing O
it O
within O
reason. O
If O
you're O
reblogging O
other O
people's O
works O
and O
commenting O
on O
them O
and O
just O
being O
active O
in O
the O
community, O
then O
advertising O
your O
stuff O
will O
be O
seen O
as O
adding O
to O
the O
community O
too, O
rather O
than O
shilling. O
Remember O
that O
within O
your O
fandom O
there O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
market O
for O
your O
stuff. O
You O
just O
have O
to O
put O
your O
stuff O
out O
there O
naturally O
and O
let O
*them* O
find O
it, O
rather O
than O
shoving O
it O
under O
everyone's O
noses. O
[SEP]
Do O
you O
cross-post O
to O
AO3, O
and O
any O
fandom-specific O
archives O
(assuming O
there O
are O
any)? O
Cross-posting O
can O
get O
more O
eyes O
on O
your O
page. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Promote O
in O
the O
places O
where O
it's O
appropriate. O
On O
this O
subreddit, O
that O
would O
be O
Friday's O
Weekly O
Fic O
Showcase. O
Some O
threads O
let O
you O
post O
excerpts O
("Show O
me O
your O
funniest O
scene," O
"What's O
your O
most O
romantic O
line?" O
etc.) O
A O
snippet O
of O
your O
writing O
may O
get O
someone O
interested. O
If O
you O
put O
your O
FFN O
and/or O
AO3 O
username O
in O
your O
flair, O
an O
intrigued O
reader O
can O
go O
look O
up O
your O
work O
directly. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Other O
fanfiction O
subreddits O
like O
r/AO3 O
also O
have O
designated O
self-promo O
threads, O
although O
that O
sub O
is O
probably O
for O
AO3 O
users. O
(Another O
reason O
to O
cross-post.) O
[SEP]
With O
the O
caveats O
that O
a) O
it's O
hard O
to O
tell O
where O
your O
readers O
are O
coming O
from O
and O
b) O
you'll O
never O
fully O
know O
whether O
your O
promotion O
of O
your O
fic O
= O
more O
readers, O
as O
others O
have O
said: O
post O
links O
to O
the O
fic O
in O
the O
appropriate O
places O
of O
fannish O
spaces O
in O
your O
fandom, O
wherever O
they O
are. O
Be O
matter-of-fact O
about O
it O
and O
don't O
beg. O
I O
usually O
do O
something O
like, O
"Hey, O
I O
posted O
a O
new O
fic, O
here's O
the O
link, O
go O
read!" O
and O
then O
leave O
it O
and O
let O
it O
go. O
[SEP]
The O
thing O
about O
AO3 O
is O
that O
I O
really O
just O
don't O
like O
it. O
Nothing O
against O
those O
who O
post O
there, O
I O
just O
prefer O
FFN. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
yeah O
I'll O
post O
on O
threads O
like O
that O
and O
I'll O
promote O
on O
the O
weekly O
showcase. O
Thanks O
for O
the O
advice. O
[SEP]
What O
makes O
this O
difficult O
is O
that O
my O
story O
is O
a O
crossover, O
so O
it O
can O
be O
hard O
to O
market O
it O
to O
people O
since O
many O
of O
them O
are O
only O
interested O
in O
one O
fandom O
or O
the O
other. O
That, O
along O
with O
the O
crossovers O
being O
separated O
from O
the O
main O
stories O
means O
that O
my O
fix O
is O
essentially O
hidden O
from O
readers O
who O
don't O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
look O
for O
that O
specific O
crossover O
category. O
It's O
frustrating. O
[SEP]
I O
write O
crossovers. O
I O
agree O
it’s O
twice O
as O
difficult O
than O
if O
you O
stick O
to O
a O
single O
fandom, O
but O
only O
in O
the O
sense O
you O
have O
to O
do O
twice O
the O
work. O
People O
read O
crossovers, O
especially O
this O
time O
of O
year O
when O
holiday O
challenges O
often O
incorporate O
them. O
Don’t O
let O
your O
perceived O
lack O
of O
audience O
stop O
you O
from O
promoting O
your O
fic. O
Someone O
will O
read O
it, O
trust O
me. O
It O
may O
not O
be O
two O
minutes O
from O
now, O
but O
speaking O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
posting O
fanfic O
since O
1998: O
someone O
will. O
[SEP]
I'm O
going O
to O
keep O
writing, O
I O
have O
too O
many O
ideas O
and O
I'm O
still O
interested O
in O
exploring O
my O
world O
further, O
it's O
just O
disheartening. O

Was O
it O
really O
that O
bad? O
[SEP]
A O
girl O
was O
interested O
in O
me O
during O
lab. O
I O
got O
her O
number, O
and O
we O
started O
texting O
and O
hanging O
out. O
We O
were O
clearly O
into O
each O
other O
as O
she O
was O
hinting, O
saying, O
"All O
my O
past O
boyfriends O
were O
Gemini, O
and O
it's O
crazy O
that O
I O
don't O
give O
Gemini O
vibes." O
She O
knew O
I B-Relationship_Status
had I-Relationship_Status
never I-Relationship_Status
dated I-Relationship_Status
before I-Relationship_Status
and O
was O
inexperienced. O
I O
made O
one O
mistake O
by O
just O
wishing O
her O
a O
happy O
birthday O
but O
not O
bringing O
her O
a O
gift. O
I O
only O
knew O
her O
for O
a O
month. O
I O
felt O
horrible O
and O
apologized. O
But O
she O
moved O
on O
and O
went O
to O
another O
guy. O
I O
feel O
horrible O
and O
can O
barely O
move O
on. O
Did O
I O
mess O
up O
that O
bad? O

[SEP]
It’s O
the O
first O
relationship, O
it O
will O
hurt O
forsure. O
You O
didn’t O
do O
anything O
wrong, O
she O
doesn’t O
have O
great O
communication O
skills, O
so O
a O
great O
thing O
for O
you O
to O
work O
on O
moving O

communication O

It’s O
a O

Hope O
you O

in O

it O

[SEP]
I O
don't O
think O
astrology O
talk O
is O
cause O
for O
running, O
unless O
it O
dominates O
conversation. O
BUT, O
her O
moving O
on O
because O
you O
didn't O
bring O
a O
gift O
is. O
She's O
spoiled O
. O
She O
obviously O
has O
her O
expectations O
of O
a O
guy O
and O
that O
is O
monetary O
and O
superficial. O
You O
didn't O
meet O
that O
requirement O
so O
she O
moved O
on. O
Thank O
God O
for O
this. O
Real O
relationships O
can O
be O
hopeful O
for O
gifts O
but O
grateful O
for O
time O
and O
energy O
spent O
with O
them. O
Truthfully O
the O
way O
to O
show O
you O
care. O
[SEP]
Don't O
let O
your O
lack O
of O
experience O
make O
you O
think O
that O
you O
have O
to O
put O
up O
with O
unreasonable O
demands O
or O
expectations, O
it O
doesn't. O
[SEP]
Na O
you O
didn’t O
do O
anything O
wrong O
and O
for O
her O
to O
be O
expected O
a O
gift O
after O
only O
knowing O
each O
other O
for O
30 O
days O
that’s O
crazy. O
Also O
so O
just O
moved O
on O
to O
the O
next O
guy O
yeah O
she O
probably O
was O
already O
talking O
to O
him O
as O
well. O
[SEP]
I O
doubt O
it O
was O
because O
of O
this O
[SEP]
Dude. O
She’s O
nothing. O
Idk O
who O
expects O
a O
birthday O
presents O
after O
knowing O
someone O
for O
a O
month. O
But O
that O
and O
the O
zodiac O
talk O
tell O
me O
all O
you O
need O

a O

after O
1 O
month??? O

Bro, O
pick O

Go O

stop O

up. O

If O
a O
girls O
interest O
is O
conditioned O
to O
you O
giving O
her O
gifts, O
trust O
me O
when O
i O
say O
she O
is O
not O
interested O
in O
you O
but O
just O
on O
how O
she O
can O
use O
you. O
It’s O
toxic O
behavior O
101 O
and O
huge O
red O
flag. O
You O
did O
nothing O
wrong O
in O
this O
case, O
she O
was O
trying O
to O
use O
you O
by O
giving O
you O
false O
hopes. O
[SEP]
So O
that O
probably O
meant O
she's O
materialistic. O
You O
dodged O
a O
bullet O
[SEP]
Oh O
you O
dodged O
a O
bullet. O
She O
should O
have O
just O
been O
happy O
that O
you O
remembered O

wish O
her O
a O
happy O
birthday. O
We're O
y'all O

her O

rolled O
around O

just O
still O
in O
the O

each O
other O
phase? O
[SEP]
Nope, O
this O
broad O
sounds O
awful. O
You O
need O
to O
date O
other O
women O
and O
show O
what O
she O
missed. O
You O
need O
to O
delete O
everything O
you O
have O
of O
this O
woman O
and O
never O
talk O
to O
her O
again. O
She O
missed O
her O
chance. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
you're O
bad O
at O
dating O
since O
you O
stated O
it. O
But O
you O
need O
to O

more O
and O
more O
and O
you O
will O
learn O
how O
to O
get O
women O
to O
respect O
you. O
For O
one O
thing, O
how O
in O
the O
hell O
would O
this O
awful O
woman O
expect O
a O
gift O
from O
you O
when O
you're O
not O
even O
dating O
her. O
Don't O
ever O
buy O
women O
any O
gifts O
unless O
you're O
in O
a O
relationship. O
If O
it O
was O
me, O
I O
wouldn't O
have O
even O
said O
happy O
birthday O
to O
her. O
If O
she O
mentioned O
it O
later, O
I O
would O
have O
just O
said O
happy O
belated O
birthday O
and O
left O
it O
at O
that O
making O
her O
wonder O

I O
cared O

Let O
me O
tell O
you O
my B-Gender
experience I-Gender
as I-Gender
a I-Gender
girl..my I-Gender
relationship I-Relationship_Status
was I-Relationship_Status
just I-Relationship_Status
a I-Relationship_Status
month I-Relationship_Status
old I-Relationship_Status
when B-Husband_BF
my I-Husband_BF
long I-Husband_BF
distance I-Husband_BF
boyfriend’s I-Husband_BF
birthday I-Husband_BF
came I-Husband_BF
up I-Husband_BF
and O
I O
sent O
him O
a O
surprise O
gift O
a O
branded O
shirt..unfortunately O
it O
wasn’t O
the O
right O
fit O
but O
after O
a O
few O
months O
I O
bought O
him O
another O
which O
was O
more O
expensive…I O
just O
wanted O
it O
to O
be O
special O
and O
moreover O
its B-Relationship_Status
our I-Relationship_Status
first I-Relationship_Status
year I-Relationship_Status
in I-Relationship_Status
relationship. I-Relationship_Status
Then O
my O
birthday O
came O
up O
he O
didn’t O
give O
me O
anything. O
I O
mean O
I O
felt O
bad…like O
really O
bad. O
I O
mean O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
didn’t O
make O
the O
smallest O
effort O
did O
upset O
me. O
It O
doesn’t O
mean O
I’m O
a O
materialistic O
person. O
It’s O
just O
the O
way O
to O
show O
someone O
that O
you O
mean O
a O
lot O
to O
them…I O
always O
treat O
people O
the O

to O
mention O

something. O
He O

Anyways O
I B-Husband_BF
didn’t I-Husband_BF
leave I-Husband_BF
my I-Husband_BF
boyfriend I-Husband_BF
but O
I O
will O
never O
ever O
gift O
him O
anything O
in O
future O
that’s O
for O
sure O
… O
[SEP]
She O
clearly O
didn't O
like O
you O
that O
much O
don't O
relay O
on O
presents, O
you O
did O
it O
right O
now O
you O
see O
what O
kinda O
person O
she O
is O

I'm O
convinced O
some O

these O

[SEP]
If O
a O
chick O
starts O
spouting O
astronomy O
bullshit, O
run. O
That's O
likely O
not O
the O
completley O
irrational O
thing O
about O
her. O
[SEP]
It O
sounds O
like O
you O
guys O
might O
be O
a O
bit O
young O
and O
the O
connection O
wasn’t O
strong O
enough O
to O
continue O
on. O
I O
doubt O
her O
feelings O
completely O
shut O
down O
because O
of O
the O
gift O
thing, O
but O
maybe O
it O
was O
a O
small O
factor, O

what O
she’s O
looking O
for O
in O

You’ll O
experience O
this O
at O

a O
few O
times O
through O
your O

It’s O
best O

mourn O
the O

not O

move O

you’re O

[SEP]
I O
can O
see O
how O
it O
might O
have O
been O
hurtful O
from O
her O
perspective, O
as O
us B-Gender
girls I-Gender
analyze I-Gender
EVERYTHING, I-Gender
but O
that O
does O
not O
mean O
she O
should O
expect O
a O
gift. O
And O
she O
knows O
you’re O
not O
experienced—if O
I O
was O
in O
her O
position, O
I O
would O
be O
honored O
that O
someone O
trusts O
me O
enough O
to O
be O
their O
first O
SO. O
Also, O
if O
she O
just O
moved O
on O
to O
another O
guy, O
there’s O
a O
good O
chance O
she O
is O
lacking O
self-confidence O
and O
believes O
having O
a O
BF O
means O
she O
is O
“good O
enough” O
for O
someone O
else. O
I’m O
sorry O
that O
happened O
:(( O
[SEP]
Truly O
though. O
OP O
dodged O

one O
[SEP]
Indeed; O
OP O
could O
have O

bought O
a O
little O
inexpensive O

cute O
token, O
with O
a O
nice O
card O
with O
something O
silly O

funny O
written, O
like O
"Happy O
birthday O
and O
10E6 O
returns" O
(if O
you O
are O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
science). O
Girls O
love O
these O
little O
things. O
Nobody, O
however, O
would O
buy O
an O
expensive O
gift O
after O
so O
little O
time O
and O
commitment O
... O
if O
she's O
really O
so O
venal, O
OP O
would O
be O
better O
without O
her. O
[SEP]
She O
went O
cold O
right O
after O
the O
incident O
that's O
why O
I'm O
guessing O
she's O
upset. O

So O
true. O
The O
astrology O
shit O
alone O
is O
a O
big O
red O

lol O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
know O
why O
it O
hurts O
tho O
I O
guess O
it's O
my O
first O
time O
dealing O
with O
these O
emotions O
[SEP]
💀 O
[SEP]
Astrology O
not O
astronomy, O
women O
who O
are O
into O
astronomy O
are O
great. O
Just O
saying O
😁 O
[SEP]
Yes. O
He O
did. O
😅 O
[SEP]
Yeah O
she O
probably O
just O
wanted O
an O
expensive O
present O
[SEP]
Too O
many O
red O
flags. O
Brush O
yourself O
off, O
and O
ask O
more O
women O
out O
[SEP]
Just O
date O
a O
ton O
of O
other O
girls O
in O
your O
school. O
You O
have O
to O
look O
at O
it O
in O
a O
mature O
way O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
do. O
That's O
the O
whole O
point O
of O
dating O
is O
to O
find O
who O
you O
connect O
with. O
She'll O
start O
noticing O
you O
with O
other O
girls O
anyways O
not O
that O
that's O
the O
goal O
but O
she O
will O
probably O
regret. O
In O
the O
beginning O
the O
power O
of O
the O
relationship O
goes O
to O
who O
cares O
less. O
Whoever O
is O
more O
chill O
and O
layed O
back O
wins. O
[SEP]
It O
hurts O
because O
you’re O
in O
your O
head O
wondering O
what’s O
not O
good O
enough O
about O
you, O
what O
you O
didn’t O
to O
do O
right. O
Instead O
get O
a O
little O
realistic O
and O
think O
about O
her O
flaws. O
Was O
she O
really O
that O
great O
or O
was O
she O
just O
a O
cute O
girl O
that O

some O

Im O
not O
sure O
where O
to O
go O
from O
there? O
Grammar? O
Radicals? O
Words? O
Something O
else? O
A O
list O
of O
the O
order O
would O
be O
appreciated. O
[SEP]
nan O
[SEP]
There O
might O
be O
links O
to O
textbooks O
in O
the O
sidebar. O
Actually O
you O
could O
work O
on O
characters O
and O
grammar O
along O
both O
lines. O
[SEP]
ok O
so O
you've O
learnt O
Pinyin. O
First O
of O
all O
congratulations! O
I'm O
slightly O
ahead O
of O
you. O
I O
apparently O
know O
650 O
words O
and O
479 O
characters O
but O
i O
still O
feel O
like O
I O
barely O
know O
anything O
but O
I O
have O
a O
solid O
routine O
in O
place. O
Now O
we O
can O
go O
a O
bit O
deeper: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
**Listening** O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Imo O
this O
is O
the O
core O
skill, O
especially O
with O
Chinese O
and O
it's O
very O
different O
sounds. O
The O
problem O
is O
that O
listening O
is O
very O
frustrating O
at O
this O
level. O
Luckily O
there's O
a O
good O
podcast O
in O
ChinesePod. O
They O
have O
3 O
podcasts O
on O
Spotify. O
Beginner, O
Intermediate O
and O
Advanced. O
Within O
each O
podcast O
the O
levels O
are O
split O
even O
further. O
[See O
here O
for O
more O
details](https://support.chinesepod.com/hc/en-us/articles/203689510-Lesson-Levels-Explained). O
Basically, O
go O
to O
the O
beginner O
podcast O
and O
start O
with O
the O
Newbie O
podcasts. O
Slowly O
work O
your O
way O
up O
the O
levels O
once O
you're O
comfortable O
with O
that O
level. O
Note, O
they O
cover O
grammar O
and O
vocab O
in O
these O
lessons O
but O
obviously O
no O
Characters. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
recommend O
doing O
1/2 O
per O
day. O
Or O
more O
if O
you O
have O
tons O
of O
time. O
[SEP]

**Characters** O

[SEP]
Reading O
is O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
ass O
because O
of O
the O
writing O
system. O
And O
if O
you O
want O
to O
do O
any O
serious O
reading O
you O
need O
to O
learn O
the O
characters. O
My O
recommendation O
is O
to O
download O
an O
SRS/Flashcard O
(Spaced O
Repetition O
System) O
App O
to O
slowly O
learn O
Hanzi. O
There's O
Anki, O
Pleco O
and O
Skritter. O
I O
personally O
use O
Skritter O
and O
have O
found O
great O
use O
from O
it. O
Note O
that O
to O
get O
the O
most O
out O
of O
it, O
you O
will O
need O
to O
pay. O
There O
are O
courses O
within O
it O
that O
teach O
you O
basic O
characters,radicals, O
etc O
and O
also O
lists O
from O
different O
books, O
textbooks O
and O
HSK O
Levels. O
If O
you O
go O
down O
this O
route, O
I O
recommend O
going O
through O
the O
courses O
in O
the O
following O
order: O
The O
Skritter O
Character O
Course O
-> O
Skritter O
Chinese O
101 O
-> O
100 O
Common O
Radicals O
-> O
HSK O
1. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
recommend O
learning O
5 O
new O
characters/radicals O
per O
day. O
No O
more O
than O
15/20 O
otherwise O
the O
reviews O
become O
overbearing O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**Reading** O
[SEP]
[SEP]
To O
be O
honest O
you O
can O
start O
before O
this, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
becomes O
a O
lot O
more O
palatable O
after O
getting O
through O
the O
HSK O
1 O
skritter O
deck. O
There O
are O
a O
ton O
of O
HSK O
1 O
graded O
readers. O
They O
are O
boring O
but O
with O
150 O
words O
there's O
only O
so O
much O
you O
can O
do. O
It O
will O
allow O
you O
to O
combine O
your O
character O
knowledge O
with O
reading O
actual O
texts O
and O
really O
solidify O
your O
knowledge. O
Past O
this O
I O
recommend O
the O
Mandarin O
Companion O
Series, O
Chinese O
Breeze O
Series O
and O
Rainbow O
Bridge O
Series. O
You O
can O
get O
these O
as O
physical O
copies, O
ebooks O
or O
on O
the O
app O
Pleco. O
There's O
also O
the O
app O
DU O
Chinese. O
Du O
Chinese O
has O
a O
ton O
of O
content O
which O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
for. O
There's O
a O
still O
some O
free O
content O
to O
get O
through O
so O
you O
can O
hold O
off O
paying O
until O
you O
exhaust O
the O
free O
content. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**More O
Structured O
Content/ O
Textbooks** O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
above O
is O
all O
very O
unstructured O
learning. O
If O
you O
want O
more O
structure O
then O
a O
textbook O
like O
Integrate O
Chinese O
(IC) O
or O
New O
Practical O
Chinese O
Reader O
(NPCR) O
may O
be O
for O
you O
(although O
i O
still O
recommend O
doing O
some O
separate O
listening, O
reading O
and O
character O
learning). O
I O
personally O
use O
NPCR O
but O
I O
don't O
think O
you O
can O
go O
wrong O
with O
either. O
Also O
worth O
knowing O
that O
the O
word O
lists O
for O
both O
text O
books O
can O
be O
found O
in O
Skritter. O
So O
you O
can O
add O
them O
on O
Skritter O
before O
or O
during O
when O
you O
go O
through O
them. O

If O
I O

I'm O
sitting O
around, O
I O
will O
read O
some O
graded O

maybe O
add O
some O
new O

Mobile O
apps O
are O
a O
convenient O
way O
to O
at O
least O
start O
out O
with O
a O

experience. O
My O
personal O
preference O
is O
SuperChinese, O
HelloChinese O
is O
similar. O
There O
are O
a O
number O
of O
other O
apps O
people O
sometimes O
recommend. O
Most O
of O
them O
should O
have O
at O
least O
some O
free O
content. O
I O
know O
both O
SuperChinese O
and O
HelloChinese O
have O
a O
pretty O
generous O
amount O
so O
you O
can O
evaluate O
them O
and O
see O
how O
you O
feel. O
[SEP]
Who O
are O
you O
learning O
with? O
This O
is O
so O
crucial, O
because O
the O
environment O
you O
learn O
the O
language O
in O
will O
largely O
imprint O
on O
you O
as O
the O
“personality” O
of O
the O

Please O

people O

really O

At O

[SEP]
You O
don’t O
have O
to O
learn O
one O
after O
the O
other. O
Why O
not O
learn O
everything O
at O
the O
same O
time? O
Words, O
characters, O
radicals, O
grammar. O
Basically O
I O
would O
say O
focus O
on O
whichever O
one O
you O
are O
most O
interested O
in O
and O
switch O
when O
you O
get O
bored. O
Like O
for O
example, O
learning O
just O
radicals O
is O
boring. O
Constantly O
seeing O
them O

They’re O
coming O
from O

it O
us O
understandable O
that O

may O
be O
overly O
sensitive O

use. O

they O
would O
have O

I'd O

a O

was O

a O

made O

I O
couldn't O
put O
anything O

my O

at O
all O
without O
them O
getting O

immediately, O
I O
could O
only O
gently O
wash O
them O

a O

[SEP]
[SEP]
After O

but O
the O
only O
ones O
that O
are O
non O

Lume O

It's O
a O

expensive O
compared O

what O
I O
could O

for O
two O
weeks O
while O
going O
to O
a O

therapist O
to O

if O

he O
ultimately O
didn't O

while O
I O
was O

wanting O
to O
work O
on O

After O
moving O

my O

for O

I O
moved O
the O
rest O

out O

had O

that O
he O
was O
looking O

On O
a O
mutual O
friend's O
Instagram O
story O
from O
last O
night, O
I O
saw O
that O
a O
group O
of O
his O
friends O
all O
went O
out. O
My O
ex's O
ex O
girlfriend O
from O
college O
was O
there, O
who O
he O
didn't O
speak O
with O
during O
our O
relationship O
to O
my O
knowledge, O
other O
than O
when O
she O
texted O
him O
"happy O
holidays" O
during O
the O
holidays. O
They O
dated O
briefly O
again O
at O
the O
end O
of O
2018, O
which O
was O
about O
7 O
months O
before O
he O
and O
I O
got O
together. O
He O
told O
me O
that O
they O
wanted O
different O
things O
and O
just O
didn't O
work O
out O
as O
romantic O
partners. O
He O
was O
hung O
up O
on O
her O
throughout O
his O
entire O
young O
adult O
life O
and O
couldn't O
forget O
about O
her, O
until O
he O
dated O
her O
again. O
Just O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
went O
out O
with O
her O
and O
that O
she's O
hanging O
around O
friends O
that O
I O
thought O
were O
my O
friends O
is O
bad O
enough, O
but O
in O
one O
specific O
video O
where O
they O
were O
singing O
at O
the O
concert O
they O
went O
to, O
their O
faces O
were O
*really* O
close. O
Almost O
like O
they O
were O
about O

I O
am O
wildly O
hurt. O
I O
already O
feel O
like O
I'm O
being O
left O
out O
of O
a O
group O
that O
I O
hung O
out O
with O
for O
three O
years, O
but O
now O
that O
he's O
hanging O
out O
with O
her, O
I O
feel O
like O
I'm O
being O
replaced. O
Throughout O
our O
entire O
relationship O
he O
always O
told O
me O
that O
he'd O
never O
had O
a O
connection O
as O
strong O
with O
anyone O
as O
he O
had O
with O
me, O
and O
I O
thought O
he O
really O
loved O
me. O
He O
seemed O
genuine, O
and O
I O
believed O
him. O
I O
really O
loved O
him O
too. O
Now, O
it O
feels O
like O
he's O
just O
scrambling O
to O
replace O
me. O
I B-Mental_Health
had I-Mental_Health
a I-Mental_Health
panic I-Mental_Health
attack I-Mental_Health
when I-Mental_Health
I I-Mental_Health
saw I-Mental_Health
the I-Mental_Health
video, I-Mental_Health
and I-Mental_Health
now I-Mental_Health
I I-Mental_Health
just I-Mental_Health
have I-Mental_Health
intense I-Mental_Health
anxiety I-Mental_Health
that I-Mental_Health
won't I-Mental_Health
go I-Mental_Health
away. I-Mental_Health
He's O
having O
an O
NYE O
party O
tonight, O
one O
that O
I O
obviously O
wasn't O
invited O
to, O
but O
I'm O
heartbroken O
because O
I O
know O
that O
his O
ex O
will O
probably O
be O
there, O
and O
we O
used O
to O
throw O
an O
NYE O
party O
together O
every O
year O
when O
we O
lived O
together. O
[SEP]

It O
should O
also O
be O
said O
that O
he O
never O
deleted O
pictures O
of O
him O
with O
his O
ex, O
but O
he O
deleted O
pictures O
of O
us O
from O
his O
Instagram. O
Even O
after O
we O
had O
an O
argument O
about O
the O
pictures O
still O
being O
up O
while O
we O
were O
dating, O
and O
he O
told O
me O
"She O
was O
a O
big O
part O
of O
my O
life O
for O
a O
while. O
I'm O
not O
just O
going O
to O
delete O
the O
pictures." O
But O
then O
he O
took O
pictures O
of O
us O
off O
of O
his O

On O

they're O
still O
up, O

my I-Personal_Experiences
dad I-Personal_Experiences
on B-Time
December I-Time
13th, I-Time
his O
birthday O
was O
the O
22nd. O
He O
was O
one O
of O
my O
best O
friends. O
I O
haven’t O
felt O
like O
celebrating O
shit. O
You O
don’t O
have O
to O
feel O
like O
celebrating O
shit O
either. O
[SEP]

Side O
note: O
I’d O
like O
you O
to O
reconsider O
how O
you O
view O
strength, O
if O
you O
can. O
People O
put O
this O
expectation O
on O
you O
to O
“be O
strong O
and O
move O
on”, O
but O
I O
think O
it’s O
equally O
as O
strong O
to O
acknowledge O
how O
you’re O
feeling O
and O
to O
honor O
those O
feelings. O
You O
ARE O
strong. O
You’re O
doing O
a O
great O
job O
of O
allowing O
yourself O
to O
heal O
in O
your O
own O
time. O
That’s O
pretty O
bad O
ass. O
Big O
hugs O
to O
you. O

high-fives O
or O
handshake O

no O

interaction, O

you O

My B-Family
mom I-Family
passed I-Family
in B-Time
October. I-Time
Me, O
my O
dad, O
sister O
and O
grandpa O
are O
not O
doing O
anything. O
We O
are O
most O
likely O
going O
to O
just O
eat O
a O
simple O
dinner, O
watch O
some O
TV, O
and O
go O
to O
sleep O
before O
midnight. O
(I O
doubt O
I O
can O
sleep O
though O
so O
I’ll O
probably O
just O
be O
laying O
in O
bed O
with O
the O
TV O
on O
or O
just O
staring O
at O
the O
ceiling.) O
There O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
to O
celebrate. O
[SEP]
Sitting O
home, O
watching O
movies. O
He O
had O
been O
waiting O
for O
Top O
Gun: O
Maverick O
to O
stream O
and O
not O
cost O
extra. O
It O
became O
free O
the O
day O
after O
he O
died. O
One O
of O
his O
old O
staff O
called O
and O
wondered O
if O
I O
could O
give O
him O
a O
ride O
to O
work O
in O
the O
morning, O
which O
I O
will O
gladly O
do O
even O
though O
he O
needs O
to O
be O
at O
work O
by O
2 O
am. O
I’m O
not O
sleeping O
much O
anyway O
getting O
ready O
for O
his O
memorial O
on O
Monday. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
16 O
days O
without O
him, O
had O
guns O
pointed O
at O
my O
face O
and O
my O
car O
trashed, O
but O
I’m O
not O
broken. O
A O
huge O
piece O
missing, O
but O
not O
broken. O
My O
nephew O
told O
me O
I O
just O
stared O
down O
gang O
punks O
with O
guns O
while O
one O
pulled O
the O
trigger, O
and O
I O
didn’t O
flinch O
or O
scream O
or O
fall O
apart. O
I O
was O
planning O
my O
best O
chance O
of O
escape. O
I O
now O
qualify O
as O
“an O
official O
badass”. O
I O
don’t O
know O
about O
that. O
I O
might O
have O
done O
anything O
but O
think O
straight O
if O
I O
had O
realized O
at O
the O
time O
he O
pulled O
the O
trigger. O
A O
friend O
of O
mine O
watched O
the O
video O
and O
said O
Lane O
had O
to O
have O
been O
with O
me O
for O
that O
gun O
to O
misfire O
and O
then O
jam. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
After O
the O
movie O
maybe O
I’ll O
play O
our O
game O
a O
bit. O
Maybe O
use O
his O
account O
and O
characters. O
Even O
if O
things O
hadn’t O
happened O
like O
this, O
it’s O
probably O
what O
we’d O
have O
been O
doing O
anyway, O
[SEP]
Do O
whatever O
your O
mind/body O
allows O
you O
to. O
I O
felt O
such O
a O
great O
need O
at O
my O
first O
Xmas O
post O
brothers O
death O
to O
be O
ok O
and O
look O
happy O
and O
it O
drained O
me O
emotionally O
and O
physically. O
Take O
the O
time O
to O
be O
loved O
by O
those O
around O
you O
and O
do O
whatever O
you O
are O
able O
to. O
[SEP]
I’m O
pretending O
life’s O
okay O
with O
my O
husband O
even O
though O
it’s O
not. O
Wishing O
you O

tonight O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
hurt O
as O
much O
as O
we O
think. O

July I-Time

this I-Time

He O
was O
only O
30, O
and O
although O
taller O
than O
me, O
my O
little O
brother. O
My O
grief O
is O
overwhelming. O
I O
was O
only O
15 O
months O
older O
than O
him...we O
used O
to O
be O
so O
close O
then O
drifted O
apart. O
My O
heart O
is O
beyond O
broken. O
It O
has O
caused O
me O
to O
set O
relationships O
ablaze O
in O
my O
pursuit O
for O
happiness. O
Therapy O
is O
only O
a O
bit O
helpful. O
I O
understand O
what O
they O
are O
saying O
but O
my O
feelings, O
my O
grief, O
they O
just O
have O
me O
on O
autopilot. O
So, O
tonight O
I O
drink, O
and O
I'll O
likely O
text O
my O
brother O
another O
emotional O
and O
heavy O
hearted O
text...that O
will O
never O
be O
read...but O
Happy O
New O

everyone. O
May O
our O

just O
be O
a O
reminder O
of O
the O
love O
we O
had O

I O
don’t O

be O
here, O
spending O
New O
Years O
Eve O
with O
them O
was O
not O
usual O
for O
me, O
I’d O
rather O
be O
home O
but O
I’m O
here O
for O
my O
bil. O
They O
were O
married O
for O
42 O
years O
and O
he’s O
lost O
without O
her. O
I O
guess O
we O
all O
are. O
[SEP]
Funeral O
was O
today. O
I O
am O
so O
drained. O
Idk O
how O
to O
process O
going O
into O
a O
new O
year O
without O
my O
mom. O
It O
was O
sudden O
and O
unexpected. O
All O
I O
know O
is O
I O
need O
sleep. O
[SEP]
I’m O
feeling O
the O
exact O
same O
way. O
Lost O
my O
mom O
in O
February O
to O
lung O
cancer. O
My O
husband O
and O
I O
are O
at O
home O
watching O
Disney O
movies O
and O
just O
binge O
eating O
to O
deal O
with O
our O
feelings. O
I O
spent O
the O
new O
years O
with O
my O
momma O
last O
year, O
and O
honestly O
I O
just O
can’t O
bare O
to O
celebrate O
this O
year O
without O
her. O
Sending O
lots O
of O
love O
and O
light O
your O
way, O
friend. O
So O
sorry O
for O
you O
loss. O
[SEP]
We O
rallied O
to O
celebrate O
Christmas O
and O
new O
year O
despite O
losing O
mom O
in O
May O
2022 O
and O
I’m O
glad O
we O
did O
❤️ O
It O
was O
so O
hard O
but O
I O
think O
making O
the O
effort O
bonded O
our O
family O
and O
honored O
the O
memory O
of O
our O
Mom O
who O
loved O
holidays. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Every O
family O
is O
different O
though. O
Do O
what O
you O
have O
to O
do O
to O
get O
through O
it O
and O
heal O
. O
[SEP]
I O
lost O
my O
dad O
on O
October O
30 O
so O
yesterday O
it O
was O
the O
two O
month O
anniversary O
and O
I O
don’t O
feel O
like O
celebrating O
at O
all. O
I O
usually O
insist O
my O
family O
to O
do O
something O
with O
me O
but O
this O
year O
I O
came O
to O
bed O
at O
10:15 O
pm O
and O
I O
don’t O
even O
wanna O
FaceTime O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
the O
typical O
new O
year’s O
call. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
a O
void O
of O
darkness… O
I O
can’t O
feel O
love O
for O
my O
boyfriend O
or O
basically O
anyone O
other O
than O
for O
my O
mom. O
[SEP]
Crying O
and O
working... O
getting O
double O
time O
and O
half O
and O
free O
pizza O
though O
[SEP]
Just O
finished O
watching O
the O
new O
Avatar O
movie O
and O
cried O
for O
most O
of O
it O
- O
out O
of O
beauty O
and O
joy O
waiting O
for O
this O
film O
but O
also O
for O
not O
being O
able O
to O
experience O
with O
my O
little O
brother O
even O
though O
he O
never O
liked O
the O
now O
series. O
My O
brother O
died O
unexpectedly O
Halloween O
this O
year O
and O
nye O
was O
one O
of O
his O
favorite O
holidays O
cause O
he O
would O
"stay O
up O
anyways". O
My O
door O
to O
my O
room O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
open O
as O
is O
his O
and O
we O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
playing O
games O
just O
talking O
across O
the O
way O
to O
each O
other O
like O
always... O
but O
its O
been O
closed O
sense O
that O
day. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
I'm O
just O
sitting O
here O
trying O
to O
get O
myself O
to O
play O
a O
game. O
Do O
anything... O
he'd O
be O
proud O
I'm O
still O
here O
and O
the O
help O
I O
got O
after O
everything O
but O
I'm O
scared O
to O
go O
into O
2023 O
without O
my O
best O
friend. O
[SEP]
I'm O
so O
glad O
you O
made O
this O
post. O
I O
lost O
my O
mom O
this O
year O
and O
I'm O
staying O
in. O
It's O
been O
really O
hard. O
I O
hope O
you O
hang O
in O
there O
and O
know O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
heal O
on O
any O
specific O
timeline. O
Sending O
love O
[SEP]
I’m O
staying O
home O
with O
my O
mom, O
dad O
passed O
this O
autumn. O
Watching O
stuff O
on O
tv O
with O
wine O
and O
a O
cheese O
board. O
It’s O
hard. O
I O
keep O
thinking O
as O
time O
passes O
I’ll O
get O
more O
used O
to O
it O
but O
it O
seems O
the O
more O
time O
that O
goes O
by, O
the O
harder O
it O
is O
reconciling O
with O
his O
death. O
Life O
is O
hard O
[SEP]
My O
mom O
passed O
away O
in O
September O
and O
even O
tho O
it’s O
hard O
I’m O
spending O
time O
with O
my O
friends O
tonight. O
For O
me O
it’s O
better O
than O
the O
alternative O
of O
being O
alone O
with O
my O
thoughts O
[SEP]
I O
lost O
my O
Dad O
in O
October O
2020 O

Let O
me O
just O
say; O
i O
can O
burst O
into O
tears O
without O
warning. O
I O
really O
really O
miss O
them. O
[SEP]
Lost O
my O

May O

June O
2022. O
Cried O
my O
heart O

Christmas O

New O
Year. O
I O
lived O
with O
them O
all O
my O
life. O
I O
did O
my O
best O
at O
work O
so O
I O
can O
spoil O
them. O
My O
world O
revolved O
around O
them. O
May O
we O
have O
more O
better O
days O
to O
come. O

couldn't O
sleep. O
We O

[SEP]
My O
dad, O
October O
6th. O
The O
holidays O
have O
been O
unbearable. O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I’m O
looking O
at O
the O
world O
through O
dark, O
tinted O
glasses. O
Everything O
is O
darker, O
I O
don’t O
feel O
genuine O
joy O
at O
anything. O

Eating O

my O

few O
months O

Christmas O
didn’t O
feel O
like O
anything O
this O
year. O
It O

was. O
I O
just O
gave O
myself O
compassion O
and O
let O
what O
it O
was, O
be. O
I O
made O
it. O
[SEP]
It’s O
been O
6 O
years O
now O
without O
my O
mom, O
but O
New O
Years O
always O
hits O
hard O
because O
she O
was O
ADAMANT O
about O
going O
to O
Cracker O
Barrel O
and O
eating O
black O
eyed O
peas O
and O
collards O
and O
cornbread O
every O
year. O
Now O
I O
cook O
those O
things O
for O
myself O
on O
New O
Years O
Day O
and O
spend O
the O
day O
solo O
trying O
to O
prepare O
myself O
to O
make O
the O
best O
of O
the O
new O
year O
[SEP]
Also O
lost O
my O

coming O
towards O
the O

of O
the O

the O
first O
for O
everything O
really O

[SEP]
My O
fiancé O
was O
February O
2021. O
Holidays O
are O
hard. O
Thanksgiving O
was O
a O
gut O
punch O
because O
his O
birthday O
sometimes O
falls O
on O
it. O
I O
spent O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
“holiday O
season” O
working. O
[SEP]
I O
lost O
my O
grandpa O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
ago O
due O
to O
covid. O
I O
thought O
we O
had O
more O
time O
and O
that O
he O
would O
make O
it O
into O
the O
new O
year. O
Ended O
up O
here O
because O
I’m O
feeling O
completely O
lost O
and O
dumb. O
I O
don’t O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
myself O
anymore O
[SEP]
I O

Mum O
died O
in O
October. O
We O
went O
through O
Chanukah O
and O
Christmas O
and O
her O
birthday O
without O
her O
here O
and O
sometimes O
remembering O
that O
void O
rips O
a O
piece O
of O
my O
heart O
out. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
booked O
a O
local O
hotel O
with O
some O
friends O
to O
make O
sure O
I O
wasn't O
alone O
and O
that O
my O
husband O
and O
kiddo O
could O
have O
some O
fun O
in O
case O
I O
melted O
down. O
So O
far O
I'm O
sad O
but O
not O
a O
mess. O
Yet. O

My O
dad O
died O
of O
heart O
attack O
2 O
months O
ago. O
Despite O
feeling O
really O
gutted O
about O
holidays, O
my O
family O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
small O
dinner O
which O
my O
sister O
hosted. O
It O
was O
sad O
but O
we O
talk O
about O
random O
stuff O
and O
we O
sometimes O
reminisce O
things O
what O
would O
dad O
do O
or O
how O
he O
would've O
reacted O
on O
certain O
things O
that O
happened O
recently. O
It O
kinda O
alleviated O
the O
sadness. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
tried O
to O
keep O
busy O
and O
just O
enjoyed O
good O
food, O
company, O
and O
stories. O
We O
made O
it O
through O
holiday O
albeit O
trying O
way O
too O
hard O
to O
get O
through. O
I O
just O
hope O
the O
next O
holidays O
will O
be O
better. O
[SEP]
My O
mom O
died O
last O
May. O
Was O
expecting O
christmas O
to O
be O
hard, O
and O
it O
was. O
Spent O
last O
night O
with O
friends O
thinking O
it O
would O
be O
okay, O
but O
my O
boyfriend O
had O
to O
work O
so O
I O
was O
there O
by O
myself. O
And O
somewhere O
around O
12:15 O
while O
watching O
the O
fireworks O
it O
suddenly O
hit O
me O
that O
this O
would O
be O
a O
whole O
year O
of O
things O
she O
wouldn’t O
see O
and O
know O
and O
experience O
and O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
myself O
from O
physically O
running O
away. O
I O
was O
okay O
in O
the O
end O
but O
it O
caught O
me O
unawares. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
asking, O
kind O
stranger. O
I O
hope O
2023 O
goes O
easy O
on O

My O
aunt O
passed O
suddenly O
right O
before O
Christmas. O
I O
suspended O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
expectations O
for O
Christmas O
+ O
tonight O
and O
just O
spent O
them O
as O
I O
would O
any O
other O
day. O
[SEP]
Being O
strong O
means O
surviving O
another O
day O
without O
them. O
The O
first O
year O
is O
always O
the O
hardest. O
I'm O
at O
my O
second O
year O
and O
I'm O
handling O
it O
much O
better. O
You O
will O
too, O
give O
it O
time. O
I O
keep O
reminding O
myself O
what O
my O
mom O
would O
want O
for O
me O
- O
to O
spend O
the O
day O
crying O
or O
to O
live O
a O
good O
life. O
So O
i O
do O
what O
I O
must O
to O
not O
worry O
her O
and O
to O
make O
her O
proud O
so O
that O
one O
day O
when O
I O
see O
her O
she O
can O
be O
happy O
and O
proud. O
That's O
what O
keeps O
me O
going. O

died O
almost O
three O
months O

I'm O
sitting O
at O
home O
with O
my O

Overall O
I'm O
feeling O
shitty O
and O
worthless. O
My O
"friends" O
didn't O
call O
me O
or O
invite O
me O
anywhere O
since O
my O
mom O
died. O
They O
are O
also O
celebrating O
new O

am O
continuing O
the O

them, O

to O
be O
married O
next O
year. O
I O
sit O
I O
work O
and O
cry O
as O
I O
crawl O
towards O
our O
goals O
while O
I O
still O
have O
time. O
Nothing O
comes O
from O
nothing O
and O
nothing O
is O
easy. O
Today O
I O
rest O
so O
I O
can O
keep O
fighting. O
Good O
luck O
on O
your O
saga. O

My O
mom O
died O
27th O
of O
November. O
I O
wasn't O
close O
with O
her O
and O
I O
had O
troubled O
past O
with O
her. O
I O
had O
already O
cut O
ties O
with O
her O
and O
learnt O
to O
live O
without O
her. O
Despite O
that, O
I O
felt O
horrible O
for O
few O
weeks. O
Now O
I O
feel O
fine O
and O
I O
am O
living O
my O
normal O
life. O
I O
feel O
horrible O
for O
getting O
over O
it O
so O
soon. O
Sometimes O
a O
memory O
of O
her O
pops O
up O
and O
I O
feel O
wave O
of O
sadness O
and O
pain. O
I O
can O
say O
I O
miss O
her. O
However, O
I O
have O
accepted O
her O
passing O
and O
I O
am O
okay O
with O
it. O

My O
dad O
died O
in O
spring O
2021. O
I O
actually O
spent O
Christmas O
of O
that O
year O
alone O
because O
of O
Covid. O
It O
weirdly O
made O
it O
easier O
as O
I O
knew O
my O
mum O
didn’t O
want O
to O
do O
anything. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
the O
second O
year O
without O
him O
and O
we’ve O
done O
more O
this O
time O
around O
actually. O
I O
don’t O
know O
if O
that O
helps. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
it O
will O
always O
be O
a O
difficult O
time O
of O
year O
for O
loss. O
I O
think O
however O
you O
want O
to O
process O
it O
is O
up O
to O
you. O
Don’t O
feel O
any O
obligations. O
I’ve O
thought O
seriously O
about O
going O
away O
next O
Christmas O
to O
process O
the O
holiday O
season O
as O
I O
want O
to. O
Love O
to O
you. O
[SEP]
It O
will O
never O
be O
the O
same O
without O
my O
Mom. O
This O
is O
the O
3rd O
holiday O
season O
without O
my O
Mamma. O
I O
feel O
as O
each O
year O
goes O
by O
I’m O
leaving O
her O
further O
& O
further O
behind. O
Losing O
my O
Dad O
29 O
years O
ago O
was O
very O
hard… O
but O
loosing O
Mom, O
the O
pain O
is O
on O
a O
whole O
other O
level. O
💔 O
[SEP]
I O
lost O
my O
Mother O
on O
New O
Year's O
Day O
2022. O
This O
is O
the O
anniversary O
of O
her O
death. O
And O
the O
best O
way O
to O
deal O
with O
it, O
for O
me, O
is O
to O
not O
deal O
with O
it O
at O
all. O
I'll O
be O
doing O
absolutely O
nothing. O
TV, O
food, O
distractions, O
reading, O
maybe O
some O
writing, O
chilling. O
Probably O
go O
for O
a O
walk? O
Who O
knows. O

Cancer. O
My O

yesterday. O
My O
young O

thrown O

a O
party O
and O
today O
I O
have O
dragged O
everybody O
to O
church. O
I’ve O
had O
more O
crying O

than O
I O
m O
willing O
to O
remember O
today, O
yesterday, O
this O
month. O
I O
can’t O
sit O
and O
just O
mourn- O
it’s O
not O
physically O
possible O
for O
me O
(something O
is O
wrong, O
I O
don’t O
sit O
still O
mentally O
or O
physically). O
I’m O
grieving O
with O
you- O
mine O
just O
looks O
different. O
I’m O
going O
to O
eat O
with O
my O

rather O
melancholy O

like O
to O
much O
of O
me O
is O
missing O

Going O
through O
the O

going O
to O
take O
my O
8 O

Everyone's O
grief O
is O
different. O
Grieve O
as O
you O
are O
grieving O
for O
as O
long O
as O
you O
want. O
Grief O
never O
goes O
away, O
nor O
would O
you O
want O
it O
to. O
It O
does O
usually O
change O
with O
time O
and O
becomes O
integrated O
into O
your O
life O
instead O
of O
being O
overwhelming. O
Take O
your O
time, O
but O
honor O
your O
dad O
with O
a O
fulfilling O
life O
of O
your O
own O
eventually. O

a O

(not O
a O
person) O
but O
a O
kitten O
as O

to O
a O
car O
accident O
morning O
of O
XMAS O
eve. O
It O
broke O
me O
so O
I O
did O
nothing O
this O
NYE. O
Like O
some O
others O
have O
said, O
nothing O
to O
celebrate. O
I'm O
also O
pregnant O
so O
baby O
is O
the O
only O
thing O
I'm O
looking O
forward O
in O

He's O

Never O

depressed O
before O

I'm O
so, O
so O
sorry. O
Make O
sure O
to O
take O
care O
of O
yourself. O

Lost O
my O

in O
August, O
and O
didn’t O
do O
anything. O
Very O

sit O

I O
lost O
my O
dad O
in O
March O
of O
last O
year O
and O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
keep O
pausing O
and O
playing O
my O
grief, O
if O
that O
makes O
any O
sense. O
First O
time O
on O
this O
subreddit O
and O
I’ve O
finally O
pressed O
play O
again O

I’m O
sobbing O
in O

My O
mother O
passed O
from O
Alzheimer’s O
two O
months O

after O
suffering O
from O
it O
for O
over O
a O
decade O
- O
I O
am O
here O
with O
you. O
Alzheimers O
is O
the O
devil O
. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
sorry. O
I O
went O
through O
this O
with O
my O
husband O
in O
May. O
Truly O
the O
most O
awful O
disease. O
[SEP]
I’m O
so O
sorry O
for O
your O
loss O
❤️ O
[SEP]
I'm O
in O
the O
same O
boat...Feels O
like O
leaving O
someone O
behind O
regardless O
of O
how O
hard O
I've O
tried O
to O
remain O
still. O
Time O
continues O
to O
move O
forward. O
It O
will O
be O
a O
year O
in O
February O
since O
I O
lost O
my O
oldest O
child O
& O
son. O
Everyday O
since O
he O
transitioned O
has O
been O
of O
1sts, O
all O
over O
again, O
only O
now O
without O
him. O
I O
keep O
hoping O
to O
wake O
up O
every O
morning O
to O
life O
as O
it O
was O
before. O
I O
have O
to O
keep O
moving O
forward O
because O
he O
would O
want O
it O
that O
way. O
[SEP]
I O
used O
to O
love O
NYE O
now O
I O
don’t O
see O
how O
I’ll O
ever O
be O
excited O
about O
that O
day O
[SEP]
>I O
just O
want O
the O
whole O
world O
to O
stop. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
This O
is O
exactly O
how O
I O
feel. O
[SEP]
I O
just O
can O
feel O
I O
belong O
to O
this O
word O
through O
here. O
If O
I O
open O
any O
other O
social O
network O
I O
feel O
a O
huge O
disconnection O
of O
everything. O
I O
wonder O
If O
this O
feeling O
will O
disappear O
with O
the O
time O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
feel O
the O
same O
way. O
I O
just O
want O
the O
whole O
world O
and O
everything O
to O
stop O
and O
now O
I’m O
thinking O
that O
he O
never O
will O
lived O
in O
2023. O
[SEP]
That’s O
a O
very O
callous O
thing O
to O
say O
to O
someone O
grieving. O
I O
lost O
my O
mom O
in O
September O
and O
if O
my O
husband O
said O
that O
to O
me, O
we’d O
have O
a O
huge O
problem. O
If O
it’s O
so O
hard O
to O
see O
you O
sad, O
imagine O
how O
he’d O
feel O
BEING O
sad. O
[SEP]
!!! O
Oh O
my O
goodness O
this O
enraged O
me O
to O
see O
this! O
Im O
so O
so O
sorry O
dear. O
People O
who O
say O
things O
like O
this O
are O
not O
worth O
listening O
to, O
I'm O
so O
sorry O
your O
husband O
has O
not O
been O
supportive O
during O
such O
a O
difficult O
time. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
space O
at O
home O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
where O
you O
can O
grieve O
comfortably, O
please O
seek O
it O
out, O
and O
do O
whatever O
you O
need O
for O
your O
sanity O
and O
health. O

I'll O
never O

get O
over O
it. O
Never. O
I O
might O
get O
used O

it... O
But O
there O
will O
never O
be O
as O
much O
light O
or O
color O
in O
my O
world O
as O
there O
was O
before O
my O
Dad O
died. O

I O
am O
genuinely O
so O
mad O
for O
you O
wtf O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O

That O
sucks, O
he’s O
being O
ridiculous O
and O
he’s O
incredibly O
lucky O
that O
it O
hasn’t O
happened O
to O
him O
yet. O
Hopefully O
he’ll O
come O
the O
realization O
and O
apologize, O
if O
not O
I’m O
truly O
sorry O
you O
are O
legally O

You O

It’s O

I O

Thank O

I’ve O

they O
are O
so O
many. O
They O
all O
helped. O
Knowing O
I’m O

it’s O
kind O

I’m O

I O

my O

my O

I O

My O

I O
don't O
even O
have O
any O
words O
to O
describe O
how O
much O
she O
changed O
since O
we O
were O

Issue O
is O
now, O
she's O
affecting O
our O
kid O
and O
that's O
unacceptable. O
[SEP]
Family O
has O
your O
best O
interest, O
but O
doesn’t O
mean O
their O
right O
all O
the O
time. O
You O
take O
your O
time O
and O
they O
should O
understand O
when O
you O
need O
that O
space. O
[SEP]
As O
for O
the O
ex O
I O
don’t O
know O
what O
to O
tell O
ya. O
If O
it’s O
effecting O
your O
kids O
I O
would O
think O
you’d O
have O
to O
draw O
a O
line O
but O
you’re O
in O
no O
position O
to O
put O
up O
with O
that O
emotionally… O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
I O
hope O
for O
the O
best O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
My O
family O
have O
been O
my O
rock O
and O
I O
know O
I've O
disappointed O
them. O
[SEP]
The O
mother O
of O
my O
kid, O
well O
she O
can O
go O
and O
fly O
a O
kite O
8m O
traffic, O
during O
a O
lightning O
storm O
[SEP]
It O
might O
seem O
like O
you’ve O
disappointed O
them O
but O
really O
I O
don’t O
think O
you O
have. O
I O
mean O
I O
don’t O
know O
your O
family O
dynamic O
but O
it O
always O
seems O
worse O
than O
it O
is O
right O
now. O
[SEP]
They've O
had O
to O
endure O
10 O
years O
of O
my O
exes O
bullshit. O
My O
fiance O
was O
the O
one O
who O
'shielded' O
then O
from O
it O
- O
and O
that's O
why O
I O
am O
in O
so O
much O
pain. O
My O
best O
friend, O
lover O
and O
life O
partner O
is O
gone O
😞😭😭😭😭 O
[SEP]
I’m O
really O
sorry. O
Once O
again O
I O
don’t O
know O
enough O
about O
your O
family O
dynamic O
I O
just O
know O
the O
hurt O
of O
the O
loss. O
I O
can’t O
make O
it O
better O
but O
I O
hope O
you O
find O
some O
solace O
soon. O
Life O
is O
going O
to O
go O
on O
and O
they O
aren’t. O
It’s O
ripping O
my O
own O
heart O
out O
to O
say O
that… O
but O
it’s O
true. O
I O
can’t O
fix O
it… O
but O
you’re O
not O
alone. O
I’m O
a O
random O
dude O
you O
never O
met O
but O
I’m O
just O
going O
to O
sit O
here O
and O
grieve O
right O
beside O
you O
if O
that’s O
okay. O
[SEP]
And O
that's O
all O
I O
can O
ask O
anyone O
for. O
She O
was O
a-flipping-mazing!!! O
We O
were O
going O
to O
get O
married O
next O
year. O
And O
all O
she O
wanted O
was O
a O
beach O
wedding, O
so O
people O
didn't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
fancy O
clothes. O
[SEP]
What’s O
her O
name? O
[SEP]
Her O
name O
is O
Astrid. O
[SEP]
Well O
here’s O
to O
Astrid O
and O
Nicole. O
We O
miss O
them O
and O
we’re O
both O
thinking O
about O
them O
and O
even O
though O
I’m O
not O
religious O
I O
would O
like O
to O
think O
that O
their O
energy O
sees O
this O
somehow. O
Have O
a O
good O
night O
and O
hope O
you O
get O
your O
peace O
when O
and O
where O
you O
can. O
[SEP]
To O
Nicole O
and O
Astrid, O
Mey O
their O
memories O
never O
fade O
and O
their O
souls O
be O
at O
peace. O
[SEP]

I O
am O
not O

either, O

I O

It's O
been O
a O
year O
[SEP]
A O
year O
ago, O
on O
the O
night O
of O
December O
31st, O
I O
sent O
this O
message O
to O
a O
friend: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
"Sorry O
to O
bother. O
I B-Gender
don't I-Gender
think I-Gender
I'm I-Gender
gonna I-Gender
be I-Gender
able I-Gender
to I-Gender
remain I-Gender
a I-Gender
man I-Gender
for I-Gender
my I-Gender
whole I-Gender
life. I-Gender
I O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
someone" O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
I O
did. O
I O
created O
this O
account O
(on O
January O
2nd, O
still O
needed O
a O
bit O
of O
courage). O
I O
talked O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
someones. O
I O
lost O
a O
very O
important O
someone. O
My O
parents O
call O
me O
by O
the O
wrong O
name. O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
my O
life O
is O
going O
to O
be. O
But O
I'm O
better. O
I O
don't O
wake O
up O
from O
dreams O
where O
my O
voice O
has O
been O
stolen O
from O
me O
anymore. O
I O
even O
sometimes O
dream O
about O
ordinary O
things. O
People O
call O
me O
"Ma'am" O
whenever, O
even O
with O
no O
makeup O
on. O
I'm B-Age
not I-Age
a I-Age
beautiful I-Age
woman, I-Age
but O
I O
don't O
care, O
that's O
not O
why O
I O
was O
there O
in O
the O
first O
place. O
And O
I O
feel O
more... O
solid. O
More O
grounded. O
I O
can O
notice O
things O
now. O
I O
even O
have O
complex O
emotional O
responses O
that O
aren't O
just O
anxiety O
and O
self-hatred. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
despite O
all O
odds, O
I O
lived. O
[SEP]

So O
here's O
to O
a O

[SEP]
When O
I B-Location

I O

cross O

I B-Location

I O

I O

Bob O

This O
may O
come O
across O

ridiculous O

perhaps O
related O
to O
u/FrumptiousDonut's O

for O
similar O

I'd O
probably O
go O
to O
Red O

[SEP]
That O
is O

Maybe O
it O

emotional O
punching O

Not O
allowed O

If O
I O
preemptively O

She O

crying O

of O
something O
that O
happened. O
It O
could O
be O
a O
bad O

or O
just O
a O
bad O

What O
she O
vents O
to O

is O
always O
worse O
than O
what O
actually O
happened. O
This O
makes O
me O
want O
to O

then O
I O
find O
out O
that O
it O
wasn't O
as O
"bad" O
as O
she O
initially O
made O
it O
to O
be. O
I O
feel O
like O
she O
wanted O
to O
be O
a O
victim O
so O
she O
can O
complain O
and O
someone O
feels O
bad O
for O
her. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
This O
gets O
me O
into O
even O
more O

because O
I'm O
not O
going O

tolerate O
someone O
I O
know O
disrespexting O
my O

I O
try O
to O

her O
and O
I'll O
say O
things O
like O
"you O
shouldn't O
let O
people O
walk O
all O
over O
you. O
Then O
she O
gets O
mad O
at O
me O
because O
now O
I'm O
"lecturing" O
her. O
She O
further O
breaks O
down O
telling O
me O
how O
sh!ty O
she O
feels O
and O
I O
make O
it O
worse O
by O
telling O
her O
she O
"needs O

Which O
is O
what O

My B-Family

Sensitive I-Family
Dysphoria, I-Family
so O
she O
goes O
from O
zero O
to O
hysterical O
victim O
before O
you O
can O
blink. O
As O
someone O
who O
grew O
up O
with O
that, O
please O
protect O
your O
kids. O
I O
can O
promise O
you O
this O
will O
affect O
them O
more O
and O
more O
as O
they O
get O
older. O
It O
feels O
like O
you’re O
constantly O
in O
a O
no-win O
situation O
and O
it O
puts O
the O
kids O
(and O
you) O
in O
the O
position O
of O
trying O
to O
keep O
your O
wife O
on O
an O
even O
keel. O
That’s O
not O
their O
responsibility O
and O
it’s O
not O
something O
they O
will O
ever O
be O
successful O
at. O
That O
constant O
push O
and O
pull O
of O
being O
damned O
if O
they O
do O
and O
damned O
if O
they O
don’t O
will O
shape O
them O
in O
all O
the O
wrong O
ways O
and O
teach O
them O
to O
put O
up O
with O
things O
they O
shouldn’t O
in O
their O
relationships. O
You O
and O
your O
wife O
both O
need O
counseling O
— O
her O
for O
her O
inappropriate O
and O
over O
the O
top O
responses O
and O
you O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
respond, O
draw O
boundaries, O
and O
protect O
your O
children O
in O
the O
healthiest O
way O
possible. O
The O

you O
deal O
with O
this O
the O
better. O

your O

She's O
been O
on O
so O
many O
different O
meds. O
We O
are O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
that O
works. O
Her O
psych O
basically O
told O
her O
to O
admit O
herself O
into O
a O
facility O
because O
she O
doesn't O
know O
what O
to O
do. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
was O
recently O
baker O
acted. O
The O
facility O
they O
sent O
her O
to O
was O
a O
drug O
abuse O
facility O
that O
treates O
her O
like O
a O
substance O
abuser O
when O
the O
issue O
was O
she O
tried O
to O
kill O
herself. O
That O
made O
her O
anxiety O
and O
depression O
worse. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
has O
a O
therapist, O
but O
doesn't O
see O
him O
enough. O
I O
also O
have O
a O
therapist. O
I O
see O
him O
bimonthly. O

Mental O
Health O
Treatment O
is O
Garbage O
in O
the O
U.S. O
[SEP]
She O
needs O
therapy O
because O
this O
is O
not O
normal O
behavior. O
She O
might O
also O
need O
medication O
but O
only O
a O
therapist O
and O
doctor O
can O
treat O
her. O
You O
can’t O
help O
her. O
And O
how O
can O
she O
be O
a O
great O
mother O
if O
your O
children O
are O
watching O
her O
constantly O
freak O
out O
all O
the O
time? O
Children O
feel O
responsible O
for O
their O
parents’ O
behavior O
and O
if O
they O
see O
her O
crying O
and O
unable O
to O
be O
consoled, O
they O
will O
think O
they O
have O
done O
something O
to O
make O
her O
behave O
that O
way. O
Convince O
her O
to O
get O
help O
and O
tell O
her O
how O
she O
is O
damaging O
your O
kids. O
Instead O
of O
trying O
to O
fix O
her, O
make O
sure O
your O
children O
are O
supported O
and O
feel O
secure. O
Your O
job O
as O
a O
father O
is O
more O
important O
than O
your O
job O
as O
a O
husband. O
[SEP]
She's O
constantly O
dragging O
you O
into O
the O
middle O
of O
her O
drama, O
then O
punishing O
you O
for O
trying O
to O
help. O
We O
help O
the O
people O
we O
care O
about! O
If O
once O
or O
twice O
she O
needed O
support O
for O
an O
issue O
that O
she O
just O
needed O
to O
work O
out O
for O
herself, O
then O
it O
would O
make O
sense O
to O
step O
back, O
but O
not O
as O
a O
way O
of O

I B-Gender

I O

the O

I O
never O

I O
was O

[SEP]
Your O
wife O
needs O
a O
backbone. O
[SEP]
She O
sounds O
like O
a O
drama O
queen. O
She O
needs O
to O
grow O
up O
if O
things O
are O
constantly O
“happening O
to O
her O
“. O
Personally O
I’d O
stop O
feeding O
it O
by O
giving O
energy O
and O
attention. O
[SEP]
Get O
her O
into O
therapy. O
[SEP]
She O
is O
astoundingly O
immature O
and O
the O
two O
of O
you O
seem O
stuck O
in O
a O
deeply O
codependent O
relationship. O
Insist O
that O
she O
gets O
into O
therapy O
so O
she O
can O
learn O
to O
stand O
on O
her O
own O
two O
feet. O
And O
get O
some O
yourself O
so O
you O
can O
learn O
to O
let O
her. O
She O
sounds O
exhausting, O
OP. O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
divorcebait O
[SEP]
This O
sounds O
like O
untreated O
severe O
anxiety. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
probably O
needed O
to O
be O
on O
meds O
a O
decade O
ago. O
Please O
make O
her O
go O
see O
a O
professional O
and O
be O
patient O
in O
helping O
her O
find O
an O
equilibrium. O
[SEP]
When O
I O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
is O
like O
that O
I O
let O
her O
vent O
with O
the O
phone O
on O
my O
table. O
I O
get O
on O
with O
what O
I’m O
doing O
and O
whenever O
I O
stop O
hearing O
her O
voice O
come O
through O
I O
murmur O
something. O
[SEP]
Because O
she O
wants O
to O
vent, O
she O
doesn’t O
want O
solutions O
or O
ideas. O
I O
don’t O
think O
she O
realizes O
I’m O
not O
listening O
to O
her O
and O
I O
can’t O
because O
I’m O
a O
pragmatist O
and O
it O
would O
drive O
me O
crazy. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
know O
if O
this O
is O
a O
solution O
for O
a O
spouse O
but O
it O
works O
well O
for O
me. O

Good O

You O
are O
not O
supposed O
to O
be O
anyone's O
punching O
bag. O
Especially, O
and O
most O
importantly, O
your O
wife's O
punching O
bag. O
You O
need O
to O
look O
in O
the O
mirror O
and O
tell O
yourself O
the O
truth O
- O
she O
is O
abusing O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
you O
have O
been O
allowing O
her O
to O
treat O
you O
this O
way, O
without O
any O
consequences, O
so O
you O
have O
basically O
been O
enabling O
her O
terrible O
behavior. O
Turning O
that O
ship O
around O
is O
going O
to O
require O
some O
real O
personal O
strength O
on O
your O
part. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
advice O
is O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
quiet O
and O
calm O
time O
and O
then O
sit O
down O
with O
your O
wife O
and O
SERIOUSLY O
tell O
her O
that O
you O
aren't O
willing O
to O
be O
her O
punching O
bag O
anymore O
and O
that O
she O
needs O
to O
seek O
help O
by O
therapy. O
If O
she O
starts O
to O
lose O
it, O
repeat O
that O
you O
are O
no O
longer O
going O
to O
participate O
in O
her O
unreasonable O
and O
overboard O
responses O
and O
will O
wait O
until O
she O
get O
herself O
under O
control. O
Then O
get O
up O
and O
walk O
away. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Honestly, O
OP, O
this O
is O
not O
something O
you O
can O
fix. O
All O
you O
can O
do O
is O
to O
start O
protecting O
yourself O
from O
her O
behavior. O
She O
has O
to O
fix O
this. O
Or O
not. O
And O
then O
you O
will O
have O
to O
decide O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
want O
to O
spend O
your O
life. O
[SEP]
This O
post O
is O
long O
but O
worth O
it. O
I O
used O
to O
be O
just O
like O
your O
wife. O
The O
crying. O
The O
avoidance. O
The O
negativity. O
I O
lost O
lots O
of O
relationships O
and O
jobs O
because O
I O
was O
a O
mess. O
Show O
this O
message O
to O
her O
because O
I O
am O
writing O
it O
directly O
to O
her O
and O
to O
you. O
It O
may O
help O
coming O
from O
someone O
who O
was O
in O
her O
shoes O
and O
got O
better. O

Clinical O
depression O
sufferers O
who O
never O
developed O
effective O
coping O
skills O
often O
exhibit O
behaviors O
like O
you O
wife's. O
She O
needs O
an O
evaluation O
by O
a O
GP O
then O
a O
Psychiatrist, O
possibly O
medication O
to O
get O
her O
up O
to O
a O
point O

she O
can O
learn O

skills O
and O
long O
term O
behavioral O
counseling O
by O
a O
Psychologist O
or O
an O
experienced O
Licensed O
Clinical O
Social O
Worker O
to O
learn O
to O
recognize O
when O
she O
is O
going O
down O
the O
wrong O
path O
and O
apply O
effective O
coping O
skills. O
This O
stuff O
is O
a O
SKILL O
just O
like O
how O
to O
repair O
a O
house, O
change O
a O
baby O

negotiate O
for O
a O
new O
car. O
It O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Her O
symptoms O
sound O
very O
much O
like O
mine O
when O
I O
was O
younger. O
Once O
I O
saw O
a O
doctor, O
I B-Health
started I-Health
antidepressants, I-Health
discovered B-Health
I I-Health
had I-Health
extremely I-Health
low I-Health
Vitamin I-Health
D I-Health
levels I-Health
in I-Health
my I-Health
blood, I-Health
got B-Health
a I-Health
referral I-Health
to I-Health
a I-Health
sleep I-Health
clinic I-Health
and O
was B-Health
diagnosed I-Health
with I-Health
sleep I-Health
apnea I-Health
from I-Health
being I-Health
overweight I-Health
from I-Health
eating I-Health
for I-Health
comfort I-Health
and O
figured O
out O
I B-Health
had I-Health
Seasonal I-Health
Affective I-Health
Disorder I-Health
(ironically I-Health
called I-Health
SAD) I-Health
by O
examining B-Mental_Health
my I-Mental_Health
patterns I-Mental_Health
of I-Mental_Health
depression I-Mental_Health
(I B-Mental_Health
always I-Mental_Health
got I-Mental_Health
REALLY I-Mental_Health
depressed I-Mental_Health
in I-Mental_Health
the I-Mental_Health
winter). I-Mental_Health
I O
learned O
how O
to O
recognize O
poor O
thought O
patterns O
and O
behaviors, O
how O
to O
change O
those O
behaviors O
and O
my O
life O
improved O
greatly O
over O
the O
next O
few O
years. O
Now O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
kill O
myself O
every O
day, O
I've O
learned O
when O
and O
how O
to O
assert O
myself, O
my O
career O
has O
taken O
off O
and O
I O
have O
developed O
good O
long O
term O
friendships O
and O
relationships. O
She O
needs O
help O
to O
get O
there O
and O
you O
need O
help O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
support O
her O
effectively. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Don't O
waste O
a O
day. O
Talk O
to O
her. O
Get O
her O
friends O
and O
family O
to O
encourage O
her O
to O
take O
action. O
It O
may O
be O
the O
hardest O
thing O
she O
ever O
does O
(it O
was O
for O
me) O
but O
its O
worth O
it O
in O
the O
end. O
If O
she O
doesn't O
understand O
or O
believe O
its O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do, O
have O
an O
intervention O
(learn O
how O
by O
googling O
"How O
to O
have O
an O
intervention") O
and O
talk O
to O
to O
her O
about O
your O
concerns. O
Tell O
her O
you O
are O
worried O
about O
her. O
Tell O
her O
the O
situation O
isn't O
sustainable O
and O
is O
deeply O
effecting O
your O
relationship. O
Listen O
to O
her O
then O
ask O
her O
to O
trust O
you O
and O
get O
help. O
Once O
she O
is O
comfortable O
enough O
with O
the O
idea O
(this O
may O
take O
time), O
then O
both O
of O
you O
talk O
to O
a O
General O
Practitioner O
to O
get O
a O
referral O
to O
a O
Psychiatrist O
and O
to O
evaluate O
her O
physical O
condition. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
There O
are O
all O
kinds O
of O
medical O
issues O
like O
thyroid, O
hormonal O
and O
adrenal O
problems, O
anemia, O
vitamin O
imbalances O
and O
other O
conditions O
that O
can O
be O
linked O
to O
depression O
but O
doctors O
have O
to O
run O
tests O
to O
identify O
or O
eliminate O
them. O
After O
those O
causes O
have O
been O
confirmed O
and O
treated O
or O
eliminated, O
the O
Psychiatrist O
can O
step O
in O
to O
help O
her O
with O
meds O
and O
find O
a O
qualified O
behavioral O
therapist O
but O
start O
the O
process O
right O
away. O
This O
is O
no O
different O
than O
if O
she O
felt O
a O
lump O
on O
her O
breast O
or O
had O
extreme O
knee O
pain O
that O
kept O
her O
from O
walking. O
Problems O
have O
solutions O
but O
only O
if O
you O
face O
them O
and O
seek O
help. O
Facing O
things O
may O
not O
be O
her O
strength O
right O
now O
but O
if O
she O
trusts O
you O
she O
can O
still O
get O
help. O
[SEP]

Illnesses O
have O
to O
be O
treated O
to O
have O
improvement O
and O
there O
is O
no O
shame O
in O
treating O
any O
illness. O
My O
illnesses O
bundled O
together O
almost O
killed O
me O
but O
now O
I'm O
so O
glad O
I O
took O
action. O
I O
learned O
that O
some O
were O
genetic/medical O
(neurotransmitter O
regulation O
problems O
and O
vitamin O
deficiency), O
some O
were O
weight O
& O
sleep O
related O
and O
others O
required O
I O
just O
learn O
better O
ways O
of O
dealing O
with O
my O
problems. O
I O
DID! O
I O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
help O
along O
the O
way O
but O
I O
got O
better. O
She O
can O
too. O
Just O
help O
her O
take O
the O
first O
step. O
Good O

Oh O
shit, O
my O

is O
like O
this...a O
couple O
years O

she O
told O
me O
some O
teenagers O
who O
were O
hanging O
out O
on O
her O
street O
were O
threatening O
her O

I'm O
instantly O

THE O
SHIT, O
LET'S O
GO O
I'M O
MAKING O
KIDDYPIE. O

my O

at O
them O
like O

sorry O
kids. O

We O
call O
her O

1/100 O

something O
crazy O
DID O
happen O
and O
she's O
absolutely O
not O
making O
it O
up, O
but O
the O
other O
99 O
times, O
reality O
is...greatly O
exaggerated. O

Honestly O
I'm O
pretty O
sure O
it's O
a O

that O
doesn't O
excuse O

exhausting O
it O
is. O

Be O
careful, O
pretty O

your O

You O
need O
some O
help, O
too, O
but O
not O
nearly O
as O
much, O
so O
you O
can O
handle O
this O
properly. O
You O
need O
to O
draw O
a O
line--"You O
don't O
want O
me O
to O
help O
you, O
you O
keep O
getting O
into O
these O
situations, O
and O
I'm O
tired O
of O
all O
the O
drama." O
[SEP]

And O
if O
she O
won't O
get O
help, O
well, O
you O
know O
what O
you O
need O
to O
do, O
and O
it O
involves O
lawyers. O
For O
your O
own O
mental O

you O
can't O

What O
you O

that O

that O

you O

her. O
She O
further O
breaks O
down O

I O
make O
it O

[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Saying O
"don't O
let O

walk O
all O
over O
you" O
isn't O
consoling O
here. O
You O
are O
lecturing O
her O
at O
this O
point O
and O
it O
seems O
she O
wants O
comfort, O
not O
solutions O
here. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
would O
suggest O
that O
you O
have O
a O
clear O
conversation O
with O
her O
when O
she O
is O
calm O
and O
explain O
that O
you're O
not O
going O
to O
intervene O
with O
any O
situation O
unless O
she O
directly O
asks O
you O
to. O
[SEP]
She O
needs O
to O
fix O
her O
problems. O
Everytime O
she O
tells O
you O
about O
them O
to O
“vent,” O
she O
is O
dumping O
it O
on O
you O
and O
is O
being O
rewarded O
for O
not O
fixing O
it, O
unfortunately. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
a O
SO O
I O
would O
reasonable O
support, O
but O
cut O
her O
off O
once O
it’s O
too O
much O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Unfortunately, O
hate O
to O
say O
it, O
you O
would O
be O
enabling O
her O
further O
if O
you O
keep O
empathizing O
with O
her O
-> O
she O
never O
fixes O
her O
issues O
by O
herself. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
not O
sure O
how O
to O
fix O
this, O
I O
would O
probably O
listen O
to O
4-5 O
sentences, O
then O
change O
activity/subject. O
Gradually O
lessen O
how O
much O
you O
listen. O
Ask O
her O
questions O
and O
leave O
the O
answers O
hanging. O
Do O
not O
propose O
solutions O
and O
do O
not O
step O
in. O
It’s O
going O
to O
be O
a O
process, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
do O
this. O

My O

a O
similar O
though O
not O
quite O
as O
bad O
behaviour. O
She O
interprets O
everything O

a O
personal O
attack. O
She's O
been O
in O
a O
bunch O
of O
therapy O
and O
gotten O
prescribed O
medicines O
lots O
of O
times O
that O
she O
doesnt O
want O
to O
take. O
Thing O
continue O
to O
go O
poorly. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
This O
is O
not O
something O
that O
fixes O
itself. O
It's O
likely O
a O
medical O
or O
personality O
disorder O
that O
needs O
treatment. O
Please O
see O
if O
you O
can O
have O
her O
seek O
out O
therapy O
so O
she'll O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
feel O
better. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
that O
doesnt O
work O
give O
some O
thought O
to O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
want O
to O
live O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life. O
[SEP]
If O
she O
doesn't O
choose O
consciously O
to O
go O
to O
therapy O
and O
make O
the O
most O
out O
of O
it, O
you O
two O
are O
getting O
a O
divorce O
at O
some O
point. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
no O
clue O
how O
you O
can O
convince O
her, O
though O
maybe O
you O
should O
attend O
therapy O
yourself O
and O
recommend O
she O
joins O
you. O
But O
yeah, O
a O
person O
in O
poor O
mental O
health O
who O
refuses O
to O
deal O
with O
problems O
like O
an O
adult O
is O
not O
someone O
you'll O
be O
able O
to O
stay O
happy O
with. O
Don't O
let O
her O
run O
your O
life O
like O
you're O

for O
a O
toddler, O
she O
needs O
to O
commit O
to O
working O
on O
her O
problems O
healthily. O

This O
is O
a O
complex O
woman. O
So O
are O
her O
feelings, O
and O
she O
is O
immature O
and O
probably O
spoiled. O
Some O
of O
that O
is O
good, O

behavior O
is O

with O
this O
for O
long. O

I've O

to O
wonder O
why O
you O

bipolar? O
Because O
I O
know O
someone O

that O

doesn't O
take O
her O
meds. O
[SEP]

is O
pretty O
abusive O

work O
with. O

over O
everything. O
Yuck O

sounds O
exhausting O
[SEP]
Ah O
Prince O
Harry. O
I O
feel O

pain. O
[SEP]
She O
needs O
DBT O
therapy O
if O
she’s O
borderline. O
It O
can O
be O
incredibly O
effective O
[SEP]
This O
opens O
another O
can O
of O
worms O
😨 O
[SEP]
that O
would O
drive O
me O
crazy. O
I O
couldn't O
do O
it. O
I B-Interests
love I-Interests
politics, I-Interests
but O
when O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
starts O
in O
about O
some O
political O
thing O
that O
I O
have O
already O
heard, O
I O
want O
to O
shut O
it O
down. O
And O
politics O
are O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
subjects, O
but O
I O
need O
original O
thought. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Can O
I O
vent O
to O
you O
some O
more? O
[SEP]
This O
is O
the O
most O
direct O
and O
concise O
answer O
so O
far. O
[SEP]
There's O
asking O
someone O
to O
listen O
and O
there's O
asking O
someone O
to O
constantly O
take O
on O
their O
emotional O
baggage O
without O
remotely O
trying O
to O
be O
proactive O
about O
their O
own O
mental O
health. O
[SEP]
I've O
tried O
asking, O
she O
"doesn't O
know". O
She's O
not O
one O
to O
make O
decisions O
especially O
when O
in O
an O
altered O
state O
of O
mind O
[SEP]
I O
always O
want O
problem O
solving. O
But O
then O
again, O
I O
always O
want O
to O
problem O
solve O
as O
well. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
frankly O
all O
my O
female O
friends O
are O
the O
same. O
I O
guess O
we O
are O
anomalies. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
won't O
bring O
up O
a O
problem O
unless O
I O
want O
someone O
else's O
perspective. O
[SEP]
I O
literally O
just O
posted O
a O
similar O
comment O
😂 O
[SEP]
But O
how O
many O
hours O
a O
week O
does O
OP O
have O
to O
listen? O
For O
example O
is O
it O
okay O
for O
OP O
to O
say O
they O
will O
listen O
for O
say, O
one O
hour O
one O
time O
per O
week? O
[SEP]
She’s O
histrionic. O
What O
she O
wants O
is O
to O
be O
the O
victim, O
and O
having O
to O
take O
responsibility O
for O
her O
behavior O
interferes O
with O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
agree O
he O
shouldn’t O
say O
that, O
but O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
he O
is O
doing O
these O
third O
parties O
a O
disfavor O
since O
the O
circumstances O
are O
never O
as O
dire O
as O
she O
represents. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
absolutely O
needs O
counseling. O
This O
is O
not O
normal O
behavior O
and O
is O
harming O
her O
and O
her O
relationships. O
[SEP]
I O
second O
DBT. O
Maybe O
she O
would O
benefit O
from O
an O
intensive O
outpatient O
program, O
if O
you O
have O
one O
nearby. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
exactly O
it. O
She's O
a O
drama O
queen, O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
emotional O
vampire. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
when O
she O
starts O
talking O
about O
something O
bad O
happening O
to O
her, O
ask O
her O
if O
she O
wants O
anything O
from O
you. O
She O
will O
likely O
say O
no. O
Then O
take O
EVERYTHING O
she O
says O
about O
the O
situation O
and O
divide O
it O
by O
2? O
or O
3 O
or O
10? O
You O
know O
your O
wife, O
so O
you O
know O
the O
denominator. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
her O
drama O
is O
boring O
you, O
tell O
her O
that O
you O
are O
starting O
to O
be O
drained O
by O
all O
of O
this, O
so O
perhaps O
she O
can O
limit O
her O
outbursts/emotional O
dumping O
to O
once O
a O
week, O
and O
she O
can O
tell O
you O
all O
the O
times O
she's O
been O
a O
victim O
for O
that O
week. O
[SEP]
This... O
[SEP]
It's O
every O
other O
day O
it O
seems. O
It's O
almost O
predictable. O
[SEP]
She's O
high O
functioning O
and O
is O
a O
chiropractor. O
She O
doesn't O
own O
her O
own O
business, O
so O
she's O
a O
slave O
to O
her O
schedule. O
Outpatient O
services O
aren't O
conducive O
to O
her O
schedule O
and O
they O
are O
strict O
with O
attendance. O
[SEP]
My O
friend, O
I O
was O
married O
to O
one O
of O
these O
emotional O
vampires, O
it’s O
going O
to O
continue O
to O
get O
worse O
until O
she O
gets O
professional O
help. O
At O
some O
point O
YOU O
will O
become O
her O
target. O
You O
will O
say O
or O
do O
something O
“wrong” O

Abusive. O

Unsupportive. O
A O

Whatever. O
Insist O
she O
get O
therapy O
ASAP O
before O
this O
happens. O
[SEP]
Honestly… O
let O
her O
call O
go O
to O

once O
in O
a O
while. O
She O
can O
tell O
you O
about O
it O
at O
dinner O

There’s O
a O
chance O
depending O
on O
type O
grade O
mutations O
how O
much O
they O
take O
out. O
They O
generally O
always O
come O
back O
but O
people O
can O
go O
30 O
years O
and O
maybe O
even O
longer O
and O
even O
when O
you O
figure O
out O
the O
type O
and O
stuff O
they O
base O
it O
on O
statistics O
and O
there O
are O
outliers O
but O
I O
would O
say O
there’s O
a O
good O
chance O
you’ll O
make O
it O
to O
fifty O
at O
the O
same O
time O
I O
am O
being O
hopeful O
low O
grade O
is O
good O
that’s O
generally O
a O
grade O
2 O
but O
they O
won’t O
truly O
know O
until O
they O
open O
you O
up. O
I’m B-Age

so O
all O
those O
are O

I’ve O
seen O
someone O

Listen O
to O
your O
doctors. O
Seek O
second O
opinions. O
You O
don’t O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
until O
you O
have O
had O
surgery O
to O
send O
brain O

to O
a O

My O

said O
that O
the O

available O
seem O
dismal, O
but O
technology/treatment O
has O
come O

far O
even O
in O

A O

Only O

can O

so O
have O
hope, O
but O
my O
doctors O
are O
optimistic O

the O

is O
in O
place O
just O
gotta O
take O
it O
one O
step O
at O
a O

There O
are O
good O
days O
and O
bad O
now O
that O
Ive O
processed O
what’s O
really O
going O
on O
but O
again O
like O
I O
said, O
the O
doctors O
seem O
optimistic, O
so O
I’m O
going O
to O
hold O
onto O
hope. O
surgery O
was O
rough O
for O
the O
first O
few O
days O
because O
of O
the O
swelling O
so O
I O
really O
couldn’t O
speak O
but O
after O
getting O
home O
it O
got O
a O
lot O
better O
and O
the O
pain O
went O
away O
to O
for O
the O
most O
part. O
Is O
your O
surgery O
scheduled O
yet? O
[SEP]
Are O
you O
in O
Philly? O
Go O
to O
UPenn O
- O
Dr O
o O
rourke. O
I O
did O
the O
“2nd O
opinion O
option” O
on O
their O
website O
and O
it O
took O
longer O
than O
expecting O
so O
call O
if O
you O
can. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
feel O
free O
to O
message O
me O
if O
you O
have O
any O
questions. O
I O
had O
my O
surgery O
9/1/22 O
[SEP]
If O
it’s O
any O
comfort O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
were O
waiting O
a O
month O
to O
get O
your O
next O
MRI O
it O
doesn’t O
seem O
urgent O
so O
that’s O
good. O
[SEP]
Wow O
how O
are O
you O
feeling! O
Crazy O
enough O
I O
tweeted O
at O
Dr O
Amankulor O
also O
from O

he O
freaking O

[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
yes, O
couple O
of O
doctors O
said O
I O
have O
to O
wait O
until O
next O
mri O
check O
just O
to O
get O
a O
sence O
of O

[SEP]
[SEP]
I'm O
just O
afraid O
of O
losing O
that O
precious O
moment O
when O
everything O
might O
go O
bad. O
[SEP]
I O
feel O
95% O
back O
to O
normal O
4m O
later. O
I O
had O
an O
astrocytoma O
grade O
2, O
idh O
mutant O
that O
was O
totally O
removed O
and O
they O
decided O
I O
didn’t O
need O
radiation O
or O
chemo O
since O
it O
was O
removed O
and O
I’m O
close O
to O
40. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
it’s O
hard O
right O
now, O
but O
it O
helps O
to O
think O
“I’m O
not O
going O
to O
worry O
until O
there O
is O
something O
to O
worry O
about”. O
I O
switched O
to O
penn O
after O
I O
met O
the O
doctors O
on O
Tuesday, O
lucked O
into O
an O
open O
surgery O
spot O
and O
was O
home O
that O
Saturday. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
my O
tumor O
will O
grow O
back O
at O
some O
point, O
and O
I’ll O
deal O
with O
it O
again O
then. O
But O
for O
now, O
I’m O
trying O
not O
to O
think O
about O
if O
and O
when O
it O
does. O
I’m O
trying O
not O
to O
look O
at O
the O
future O
except O
to O
think O
why O
wait. O
It O
might O
come O
back O
when O
I’m O
50, O
or O
sooner, O
or O
later. O
Or O
I O
could O
be O
hit O
by O
a O
bus O
tomorrow. O
So O
if O
anything O
I’m O
using O
this O
as O
a O
reminder O
to O
seize O
the O
day O
when O
I O
can. O

Glad O
you O
got O
in O
and O
out O
so O
quickly. O
I’m O

At O
some O
point O
I O
understand O
it's O
relatively O
not O
so O
bad O
as O
it O
might O
be. O
But O
it's O
still O
a O
tumor O
that O
can O
grow O
at O
any O
time, O
at O
any O
circumstances O
and O
that's O
terrifying. O
I O
keep O
up O
seeing O
doctors O
but O
next O
month O
or O
two O
will O
be O
especially O
harsh O
for O
me. O
[SEP]
Understandable! O
Cope O
as O
best O
as O
you O
can, O
& O
take O
it O
one O
day O
at O
a O
time. O
Some O
days O
will O
be O
worse O
than O
others O
but O
you’ll O
still O
find O
reasons O
to O
smile O
too! O
The O
waiting O

not O

almost O
died O

either O

That's O
why O
I O
always O
deny O

anxiety O
to O
doctors O
because O
that O
is O
the O
first O
thing O
they'll O
go O

Easiest O
diagnosis O
for O
them, O
which O

they O

I'm O

I O
thought O
at O

an O

won't O
call O

call. O
[SEP]
It O
didn’t O
sound O
like O
the O
videos O
online O
though. O
It O
sounded O
more O
like O
a O
squeak O
that O
devolved O
into O
a O
hiss. O
[SEP]
Ok, O
just O
checking. O
Squeak O
then O
hiss O
is O
very O
displeased O
indeed. O
[SEP]
why O
would O
he O
be O
mad? O
He O
was O
eating O
peacefully O
on O
my O

moments O
before. O
[SEP]
Existential O
angst? O
I O
don’t O
know, O
but O
they O
make O
noises O
with O
purpose. O
It’s O
risky O
for O
prey O
animals O
like O
cresties O
to O
draw O
attention O
to O
themselves, O
so O
when O
they O
make O
noises, O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
communicate O
something. O
They O
especially O
don’t O
hiss O
for O
fun. O
[SEP]
maybe O
something O
spooked O
him?? O
im O
doing O
something O
similar O
with O
my O
juvie O
(god O
he O
loves O
croaking O
at O
everything, O
i've O
seen O
him O
croak O
at O
a O
cricket O
then O
devour O
it O
😭😭😭) O
but O
one O
time O
i O
had O
some O
mango O
and O
i O
coaxed O
him O
out, O
he O
started O
eating, O
then O
squeaking O
so O
i O
put O
him O
back O
as O
to O
not O
stress O
him. O
i O
had O
my O
fan O
going O
and O
so O
i O
turned O
it O
off O
just O
to O
see, O
but O
the O
little O
shit O
apparently O
got O
scared O
of O
the O
fan O
blade/shadows. O
i O
agree O
with O
your O
statement O
but O
god O
they O
can O

negotiating O

[SEP]
Hey O
all! O
I B-Other
have I-Other
been I-Other
traveling I-Other
for B-Time
about I-Time
1.5 I-Time
years I-Time
and O
have O
gotten O
relatively O
decent O
contracts O
but O
I O
have O
come O
to O
realize O
that O
my O
agency O
does O
not O
really O
let O
me O
negotiate O
much O
and O
usually O
tells O
me O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
manager O
after O
I O
sign. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
example, O
I O
am O
being O
offered O
a O
contract O
now O
with O
the O
pay O
range O
at O
the O
absolute O
lowest O
of O
the O
bracket O
given. O
I O
brought O
this O
up O
and O
was O
basically O
shot O
down O
immediately O
saying O
the O
contract O
listing O
stated O
the O
pay O
range O
before O
I O
said O
I O
was O
interested O
and O
that O
the O
quoted O
offer O
falls O
in O
this O
range O
(by O
$5). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
asked O
if O
I O
could O
have O
a O
clause O
that O
included O
block O
scheduling O
as O
my O
plan O
is O
to O
get O
a O
long O
term O
AirBnB O
with O
the O
option O
of O
being O
able O
to O
drive O
home O
some O
days O
that O
I O
am O
not O
working, O
having O
recently O
bought O
a O
house O
and O
having O
house O
projects O
to O
do O
(about O
7 O
hours O
one O
way). O
My O
agency O
basically O
said O
they O
cannot O
guarantee O
that O
and O
I O
would O
have O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
manager, O
but O
go O
ahead O
and O
sign O
because O
I O
only O
have O
24 O
hours. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
was O
then O
further O
told O
that O
I O
really O
should O
not O
be O
declining O
offers O
based O
on O
pay, O
location, O
or O
shift O
as O
all O
of O
that O
is O
laid O
out O
upfront. O
My O
issue O
being O
that O
the O
pay O
is O
a O
broad O
range O
and O
the O
shift O
just O
stating O
like O
3x12 O
but O
no O
guarantee O
if O
it O
is O
one O
off, O
one O
on O
or O
what. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
all O
that O
being O
said, O
does O
anyone O
have O
any O
experience O
with O
the O
same O
or O
tips O
regarding O
this? O
I O
actually O
do O
not O
mind O
the O
location O
of O
this O
contract O
offer, O
it O
is O
a O
smaller O
hospital O
so O
could O
be O
an O
interesting O
change O
from O
my O
normal. O
I O
am O
just O
more O
worried O
that O
I O
want O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
block-style O
schedule O
and O
my O
recruiter O
is O
basically O
saying O
sign O
now, O
ask O
later, O
and O
then O
what O
if O
“later” O
comes O
along O
and O
the O
manager O
says O
they O
cannot O
offer O
that. O
[SEP]
Give O
yourself O
an O
emergency O
fund O
so O
you O
can O
afford O
to O
be O
patient O
and O
picky. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Find O
another O
recruiter O
and O
leverage O
them O
against O
each O
other. O
Especially O
bigger O
agencies O
will O
try O
to O
lower O
your O
rates O
because O
they’re O
usually O
still O
higher O
than O
smaller O
agencies. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
go O
to O
the O
second O
recruiter O
anyway O
and O
be O
like O
if O
they O
can O
just O
match O
and O
give O
me O
xyz O
you’d O
be O
surprised O
what O
you O
can O
get O
out O
of O
it. O
[SEP]
I O
feel O
like O
its O
been O
a O
lot O
more O
difficult O
to O
get O
things O
added O
into O
contracts O
like O
block O
scheduling O
or O
patient O
limits O
when O
floated O
etc. O
They O
don't O
budge O
on O
their O
pay O
either. O
Things O
are O
changing O
I O
guess. O
[SEP]
So, O
the O
block O
scheduling O
thing, O
you O
should O
discuss O
that O
with O
the O
manager O
prior O
to O
an O
offer O
even O
being O
made O
(unless O
it's O
an O
auto O
offer). O
The O
manager O
should O
either O
agree O
or O
disagree. O
If O
they O
agree, O
then O
it O
should O
be O
written O
into O
the O
contract, O
as O
it's O
a O
pre-approved O
stipulation. O
[SEP]
The O
only O
way O
I've O
negotiated O
was O
by O
waking O
away O
from O
an O
offer O
for O
a O
better O
one. O
Tried O
asking O
nicely, O
tried O
showing O
what O
other O
travelers O
were O
making, O
tried O
to O
initiate O
a O
back O
and O
forth O
with O
recruiter/hospital O
but O
nope. O
[SEP]
The O
negotiation O
should O
happen O
before O
an O
offer O
letter O
is O
signed...even O
before O
you O
send O
them O
credentialing O
- O
that’s O
when O
you O
have O
the O
power. O
If O
your O
agency O
really O
seems O
averse O
to O
negotiation; O
I O
would O
reconsider O
if O
that’s O
the O
best O
relationship O
for O
you.. O
Many O
nurses O
have O
multiple O
agencies O
they’re O
in O
contact O
with; O
could O
be O
a O
great O
route O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
it O
has O
been O
harder...more O
of O
a O
'take O
it O
or O
leave O
it' O
attitude O
from O
the O
agencies O
it O
seems. O
Unfortunately, O
they O
want O
loyalty O
on O
the O
back-side O
but O
don't O
really O
seem O
to O
do O
anything O
to O
earn O
it. O
My O
recruiter O
from O
previous O
gig O
liked O
to O
say O
stuff O
like O
'I O
fight O
for O
you' O
and O
'always O
here O
for O
you' O
but O
was O
getting O
crap O
offers O
from O
dumpster O
fires. O
She's O
sorta O
given O
me O
the O
cold O
shoulder O
since O
I O
took O
a O
better O
offer O
from O
a O
different O
agency. O
However, O
current O
agency O
gives O
all O
the O
'corporate' O
responses O
when O
ever O
try O
to O
negotiate... O
even O
tho O
the O
hospital O
says O
their O
rates O
haven't O
changed. O
Extension O
has O
a O
slight O
bump O
in O
hourly O
but O
OT O
rate O
dropped O
a O
good O
bit. O
Next O
contract O
gonna O
be O
up O
for O
grabs! O
[SEP]
I O
did O
have O
a O
decent O
emergency O
fund O
built O
up O
but O
recently O
put O
a O
bit O
into O
buying O
a O
house O
so O
slowly O
building O
it O
back O
up. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
do O
think O
getting O
a O
second O
recruiter O
could O
be O
beneficial O
though! O
My B-Finance
last I-Finance
2 I-Finance
contracts I-Finance
have I-Finance
been I-Finance
in I-Finance
the I-Finance
lower I-Finance
half I-Finance
of I-Finance
the I-Finance
pay I-Finance
range, I-Finance
so O
having O
some O
leverage O
in O
regards O
to O
that O
and O
helping O
with O
scheduling O
could O
be O
beneficial! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
just O
having O
a O
harder O
time O
with O
this O
contract O
especially O
since O
the O
rate O
is O
actually O
lower O
than O
I O
was O
making O
as O
staff, O
without O
accounting O
for O
stipend O
of O
course. O
[SEP]
Yeah O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
lot O
is O
changing! O
I’ve O
normally O
been O
very O
open O
about O
my O
schedule, O
usually O
tell O
them O
I’ll O
do O
my O
best O
to O
work O
what O
they O
need. O
I O
just O
normally O
ask O
if O
they O
can O
to O
try O
to O
block O
them O
for O
me O
as O
it O
helps O
with O
arrangements O
with O
classes O
and O
stuff, O
but O
I O
am O
flexible O
in O
that O
I O
will O
work O
with O
them O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can. O
This O
is O
the O
first O
time O
I O
specifically O
requested O
to O
add O
it O
into O
my O
contract. O
[SEP]
Good O
to O
know! O
So O
of O
the O
contracts O
I’ve O
done, O
I O
think O
I O
have O
spoken O
to O
a O
manager O
twice O
before O
the O
offer. O
Most O
of O
the O
time, O
I O
guess O
they O
are O
auto O
offers O
(at O
least O
in O
my O
case)? O
I O
definitely O
didn’t O
speak O
with O
anyone O
this O
go O
around. O
[SEP]
Don’t O
loot O
at O
the O
rate, O
look O
at O
the O
whole O
weekly O
pay. O
If O
that’s O
enough, O
take O
it. O
I O
always O
have O
an O
amount O
in O
mind O
that O
I O
won’t O
go O
under. O
[SEP]
There O
are O
not O
as O
many O
contracts O
out O
there O
now, O
which O
means O
you O
have O
less O
room O
to O
negotiate. O
[SEP]
Hourly O
rates O
being O
lower O
than O
staff O
rates O
are O
common. O
The O
stipend O
is O
where O
the O
real O
money O
is O
made O
[SEP]
You O
can O
still O
ask O
your O
agency O
for O
a O
contact O
number O
to O
discuss O
these O
things O
prior. O
Unless O
the O
listing O
specifies O
that O
it's O
an O
auto O
offer, O
you O
have O
no O
way O
of O
knowing O
if O
you'll O
talk O
to O
someone O
before O
signing. O
So O
if O
that's O
the O
case, O
then O
you're O
well O
within O
rights O
to O
turn O
things O
down. O
[SEP]
Thanks O
again! O
I O
may O
see O
if O
I O
can O
get O
a O
contact O
number! O
I O
would O
definitely O
love O
to O
speak O
with O
someone O
about O
their O
scheduling O
before O
signing. O

Hi O
y’all. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
little O
background: O
My O
first O
car O
broke O
down O
last O
year O
and O
it B-Finance
was I-Finance
just I-Finance
too I-Finance
expensive I-Finance
for I-Finance
my I-Finance
family I-Finance
to I-Finance
fix, I-Finance
it O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
lemon O
car O
and O
my B-Family
Dad I-Family
has I-Family
been I-Family
in I-Family
the I-Family
oil I-Family
and I-Family
gas I-Family
industry I-Family
for I-Family
years, I-Family
and O
ever O
since O
COVID, O
the O
industry O
hasn’t O
been O
doing O
too O
well O
and O
now O
he’s O
switched O
careers. O
Been O
a O
rough O
time O
for O
the O
family O
honestly O
but O
we’re O
on O
our O
feet. O
I O
grew O
up O
in O
a O
pretty O
good O
stable O
household, O
my O
dad O
pays O
for O
my B-Education
college I-Education
but O
I O
can O
tell O
it’s O
a O
struggle O
for O
him O
to O
do O
so, O
and O
I’m B-Age
21 I-Age
years I-Age
old I-Age
so O
I O
know O
it’s O
time O
for O
me O
to O
pull O
my O
own O
weight O
and O
purchase O
my O
own. O
It’s O
something O
I O
really O
want O
to O
do O
because O
I O
hate O
relying O
on O
others. O
My B-Family
siblings I-Family
also I-Family
are I-Family
going I-Family
to I-Family
need I-Family
my I-Family
parents’ I-Family
help I-Family
getting I-Family
a I-Family
car I-Family
so O
I O
need O
to O
buy O
my O
own O
regardless. O

Correct! O
All O

all O

a O

Edit O
to O
add: O
this O
is O
totally O
true O
story O
but O
actually O
probably O
the O
worst O
advice O
on O
this O
thread, O
other O
than O
to O
check O
/ O
clean O
/ O
or O
replace O
the O
connections O
and O
get O
down O
to O
an O
auto O
parts O
store O
for O
some O
diagnostics O
of O
the O
battery O
and O
maybe O
some O
repair O
parts O
as O
others O
have O
mentioned. O
[SEP]
Check O
and O
clean O
the O
battery O
connections. O
If O
the O
car O
has O
been O
sitting O
and O
you O
can’t O
turn O
it O
over O
with O
a O
full O
battery O
or O
a O
jump O
start O
corrosion O
might O
be O
the O
issue. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
that O
doesn’t O
work, O
tap O
on O
the O
starter O
motor O
while O
cranking O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
wood O
or O
a O
rubber O
mallet. O
Sometimes O
they O
get O
stuck O
and O
just O
need O
a O
little O
jostle O
to O
turn O
over. O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
you O
have O
a O
dick/ O
Karen O
neighbors O
that O
is O
a O
cop O
caller. O
Yes O
you O
can O
push O
the O
car O
but O
you O
also O
need O
figure O
what O
neighbor O
is O
the O
spineless O
cop O
caller O
that O
is O
afraid O
to O
talk O
to O
their O
own O
neighbors, O
and O
would O
rather O
waste O
police O
resources O
on O
vehicles O
parked O
in O
front O
of O
your O
house. O
[SEP]
You'll O
want O
to O
look O
up O
the O
specific O
city O
parking O
code O
to O
determine O
how O
far O
it O
needs O
to O
go. O
I O
haven't O
looked O
at O
Bend's O
but O
most O
cities O
will O
say O
something O
like O
"cannot O
be O
parked O
on O
the O
same O
block". O
Non-operational O
vehicles O
usually O
have O
their O
own O
constraints. O
Instead O
of O
72 O
hours O
you O
may O
only O
be O
able O
to O
park O
it O
in O
one O
place O
for O
24. O
[SEP]
Ahh, O
bringing O
back O
memories O
for O
my O
first O

That O
seems O
beyond O
OP’s O

I O

of O

that O

this O

seems O

have O
a O

and O
his O
stuff O
is O
mostly O
alt-history, O
but O
in O
order O
to O
do O
that, O
he O
first O
explains O
"real" O
history. O
I've O
only O
watched O
a O
few, O
and O
would O
recommend O
them O
for O
anyone O
over O
about O

if O
only O
due O

detail. O
[SEP]
Abeka O

Maybe. O
But O
he O
has O
a O

Looking O
back, O
I O
should O
have O
mentioned. O
Woods O
does O
too. O
[SEP]
Your O
explanation O
on O
why O
you O
wouldn't O
describes O
why O
you O

teach O

Also, O
he's O
not O

the O
kids O
seemed O
to O
know O
she O
was O
leaving O
and O
said O
goodbye O
to O
her O
on O
the O
last O
day. O
I O
just O
took O
mental O
stock O
of O
that O
and O
said O
in O
my O
head O
its O
normal O
for O
teachers O
to O
tell O
kids O
they're O
leaving O
before O
they O
go. O
So O
as O
my O
Contract O
comes O
to O
an O
end O
i O
tell O
my O
everyday O
kids O
im O
leaving. O
Some O
parents O
called O
in O
and O
asked O
about O
it O
so O
my O
boss O
got O
annoyed O
and O
told O
me O
to O
not O
say O
anything O
anymore O
and O
she O
would O
tell O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
kids O
when O
i O
was O
leaving. O
That O
never O
happened O
so O
the O
younger O
kids O
probably O
don't O
know O
what O
happened O
but O
it O
did O
eventually O
spread O
around O
so O
that O
most O
of O
the O
older O
kids O
new. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Those O
older O
kids O
asker O
when O
I O
was O
going O
back O
to O
America O
and O
I O
was O
confused O
and O
just O
told O
them O
im O
not O
as O
i O
planned O
to O
be O
in O
this O
country O
for O
many O
years, O
maybe O
my O
whole O
life. O
After O
that O
they O
kept O
asking O
again O
and O
again O
for O
my O
number O
and O
I O
would O
brush O
it O
off. O
At O
that O
time O
i O
was O
brushing O
it O
off O
i O
also O
met O
with O
a O
friend O
native O
to O
that O
country O
and O
he O
mentioned O
how O
he O
was O
having O
lunch O
with O
his O
grade O
school O
teacher O
the O
next O
day. O
I O
was O
surprised O
and O
asked O
if O
it O
was O
common O
for O
people O
to O
do O
that O
here O
(since O
it's O
not O
really O
a O
thing O
in O
america) O
and O
he O
said O
it's O
not O
"common" O
but O
not O
"uncommon" O
either. O
After O
that O
I O
asked O
a O
teacher O
native O
to O
this O
country O
if O
it's O
not O
allowed O
to O
give O
out O
my O
number O
to O
students. O
She O
said O
it's O
uncommon O
but O
not O
"not O
allowed' O
so O
i O
just O
kind O
of O
sat O
on O
that O
for O
a O
while. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
after O
my O
kids O
kept O
asking O
eventually O
I O
told O
them O
we O
can O
make O
a O
deal. O
Ask O
your O
parents O
and O
If O
its O
OK O
then O
you O
can O
have O
my O
number. O
Some O
kids O
came O
back O
and O
said O
their O
parents O
said O
its O
OK O
with O
a O
note, O
some O
didnt O
and O
I O
didnt O
want O
to O
call O
them O
liars O
so O
I O
gave O
the O
ones O
with O
notes O
my O
number O
as O
I O
promised. O
Today O
(my O
contract O
has O
ended O
atleast O
a O
week O
now) O
my O
boss O
called O
and O
asked O
why O
I O
did O
that O
and O
I O
told O
her O
the O
truth O
of O
why. O
She O
told O
me O
it O
was O
stressing O
her O
out O
and O
kept O
asking O
why O
I O
did O
it O
and O
I O
just O
kept O
repeating O
why. O
She O
then O
told O
me O
not O
to O
pick O
up O
if O
any O
parents O
call O
and O
to O
never O
do O
that O
again O
as O
it O
causes O
stress O
for O
the O
teachers O
left O
behind. O
I O
really O
didn't O
imagine O
it O
was O
a O
big O
deal O
because O
of O
the O
responses O
I O
got O
from O
friend O
and O
coworker O
but O
now O
I O
wonder O
if O
I O
was O
wrong O
or O
if O
this O
comes O
off O
in O
a O
bad O
way. O
Maybe O
the O
kids O
did O
lie O
in O
the O
end O
to O
get O
my O
number O
so O
now O
I O
feel O
bad O
about O
what's O
happened. O
does O
anyone O
have O
any O
insight? O

So, O
I O
don't O
believe O
the O

was O

However, O
I O
don't O
think O
it's O
appropriate O
to O
give O
your O
phone O
number O
to O
children. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
understand O
that O
you O
grow O
a O
bond O
with O
some O
kids O
you O
teach O
but O
it's O
a O
job O
when O
all O
is O
said O
and O
done. O
We O
get O
jobs, O
we O
leave O
jobs. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
What O
happens O
if O
the O
kids O
contact O
you O
often O
and O
you O
can't O
reply O
- O
they O
get O
sad. O
They O
see O
you O
as O
an O
adult O
they O
can O
trust O
and O
rely O
on O
and O
that's O
just O
too O
much O
to O
expect O
from O
someone O
who O
was O
only O
there O
to O
work. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
change O
your O
number, O
do O
you O
let O
all O
the O
kids O
know? O
Or O
do O
you O
move O
on O
and O
let O
them O
feel O
confused O
as O
to O
why O
you O
stopped O
speaking O
to O
them. O

[SEP]
What O
happens O
at O

Are O
you O
going O

give O
all O
these O

your O

[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think, O
in O
future, O
you O
just O
say O
your O
goodbyes. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
think O
it O
was O
creepy, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
odd O
given O
that O
you O
teach O
elementary O
students. O
I’d O
just O
take O
this O
as O
a O
learning O
lesson. O
Next O
time, O
if O
your O

want O
to O
keep O

give O
them O
your O

What's O
done O
is O
done O
[SEP]
Perhaps O
just O
don't O
reply O
to O
anyone O
who O
happens O
to O
call. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Can't O
make O
people O
not O
grieve O
or O
miss O
you. O
It O
just O
means O
something O
good O
was O
happening O
for O
a O
while O
and O
you O
made O
a O
difference O
[SEP]
You O
are O
making O
your O
boss O
and O
colleagues O
uncomfortable O
which O
is O
probably O
reason O
enough O
to O
not O
follow O
through O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Otherwise O
do O
you O
want O
to O
be O
talking O
to O
kindergarten O
kids O
on O
the O
phone O
in O
a O
week O
or O
month O
or O
year? O
What O
were O
you O
hoping O
to O
get O
out O
of O
it O
[SEP]
It's O
possible... O
a O
stretch O
but O
possible. O
The O
kids O
are O
refusing O
to O
do O
things, O
saying O
that O
you O
didn't O
do O
it O
that O
way O
and O
then O
threatening O
to O
call O
you O
and O
prove O
it. O
[SEP]
It’s O
only O
creepy O
if O
you O
let O
it O
be O
creepy. O
Keep O
it O
professional O
and O
I O
wouldn’t O
worry. O
[SEP]
Wow O
I O
cant O
believe O
I O
never O
thought O
about O
that... O
thanks O
so O
much O
for O
your O
insight O
[SEP]
OK O
that O
is O
good O
advice. O
I'll O
try O
to O
avoid O
it O
in O
general O
but O
if O
it's O
difficult O
to O
deny O
them O
I O
will O
give O
my O
email O
address. O
Thanks O
so O
much O
for O
your O
response O
[SEP]
Thanks O
for O
saying O
it O
so O
kindly. O
Yes O
I'll O
just O
have O
to O
not O
reply O
to O
anyone O
if O
they O
call. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
I O
wanted O
my O
kids O
not O
to O
feel O
bad O
about O
me O
leaving. O
I O
see O
now O
it O
was O
very O
stupid O
of O
me O
[SEP]
Sorry O
I O
don't O
quite O
understand O
your O
meaning. O
Like O
a O
new O
teacher O
teaches O
a O
certain O
way O
and O
they O
call O
me O
to O
prove O
I O
didnt O
teach O
that O
way? O
[SEP]
Yes O
I O
only O
left O
my O
number O
if O
the O
parents O
needed O
a O
tutor O
they O
knew O
their O
kid O
could O
trust O
or O
something O
(and O
also O
because O
I O
felt O
bad O
that O
my O
kids O
looked O
so O
sad) O
I O
won't O
take O
anything O
in O
a O
personal O
direction O
for O
sure. O
Thanks O
for O
your O
reply O
[SEP]
Yeah- O
kids O
are O
annoying O
like O
that O
[SEP]
Oh... O
I O
feel O
so O
foolish. O
I O
had O
such O
a O
good O
experience O
with O
them O
I O
couldnt O
Imagine O
it O
would O
cause O
trouble O
for O
anyone. O
I O
really O
wasn't O
meant O
for O
teaching O
I O
think... O
[SEP]
Well O
if O
that's O
true O
then O
good O
for O
you O
for O
seeing O
that. O
But O
the O
trouble O
might O
just O
be O
that O
they O
liked O
you O
a O
lot. O
[SEP]
I O
guess O
I O
will O
come O
to O
know O
soon O
enough O
huh? O
If O
the O
parents O
ignore O
the O
number O
maybe O
its O
for O
the O
best. O
But O
if O
they O
don't O
I O
will O
make O
sure O
to O
explain O
to O
them O
I O
meant O
no O
harm O
and O
that O
the O
new O
teacher O
is O
very O
good O

Hi O
so O
I'm O
going O

do O
I O

what O
don't O
I O
mention? O
What O
is O
most O

an O

Do O
I O
mention O
that O
my B-Sexual_Orientation

is I-Sexual_Orientation
distracting I-Sexual_Orientation
me I-Sexual_Orientation
from I-Sexual_Orientation
things I-Sexual_Orientation
I I-Sexual_Orientation
enjoy I-Sexual_Orientation
and I-Sexual_Orientation
need I-Sexual_Orientation
to I-Sexual_Orientation
do, I-Sexual_Orientation
because O
that's O
the O
truth. O
I'm O
sure O
this O
is O
me O
just O
over O
thinking O
(as O
I O
normally O
do) O
I O
just O
fear O
rejection O
and O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
I O
don't O
make O
any O
mistakes O
before O
I O
submit O
the O
form. O
Anything O
specific O
about O
Gender O
Doctors/ O
Dr O
Kirpal O
Sahota O
would O
be O
helpful O
too. O
[SEP]
Be O
honest, O
but O
don't O
stress O
too O
much, O
one O
of O
the O
upsides O
of O
private O
care O
is O
they O
are O
a O
business O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
so O
they O
will O
look O
for O
reasons O
to O
accept O
you O
as O
a O
patient O
rather O
than O
reasons O
to O
turn O
you O
away. O
[SEP]
Just O
tell O
the O
truth. O
If O
the O

is O
competent, O
they O
will O
understand O

know O
you’re O

your O

There’s O
not O
really O
a O

that’s O
all O
they O
want O

see O
[SEP]
I O
was O

my O
private O
appointment O
after O
hearing O
all O
the O
horror O
stories O
from O
people O
who O
went O
the O
NHS O
route, O
but O
the O
doctor O
I O
saw O
at O
Gender O
Care O
was O
really O
nice. O
There O
are O
questions O
they O
have O
to O
ask O
to O
tick O
boxes O
but O
they're O
not O
trying O
to O
catch O
you O
out. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
When O
you're O
paying O
hundreds O
of O
pounds O
for O
an O
hour O
long O
consultation O
there's O
a O
lot O
more O
incentive O
for O
the O
doctor O
to O
actually O
help O
you O
so O
you're O
more O
likely O
to O
recommend O
them O
to O
other O
people. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
hope O
this O
helps O
and O
wish O
you O
the O
best! O
[SEP]
don't O
look O
suicidal... O
[SEP]
[SEP]
are O
you O
going O
to O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
via O
this? O
I O
am O
with O
LTC O
so O
got O
my O
diagnosis O
seperately: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
looked O
at O
a O
combination O
of O
the O
diagnosis O
i O
was O
going O
for, O
and O
the O
WPATH O
SOC O
so O
i O
could O
play O
up O
the O
parts O
of O
my O
life O
that O
fitted O
the O
diagnosis O
and O
things O
that O
could O
be O
seen O
as O
*signs* O
from O
earlier O
on. O
could O
be O
useful O
for O
people O
who O
didn't O
necesserilly O
'*know*' O
as O
kids O
or O
whatever O
to O
find O
something O
to O
talk O
about O
[SEP]
[SEP]
i O
also O
made O
sure O
to O
avoid O
any O
of O
the O
things O
that O
the O
WPATH O
SOC O
suggested O
could O
prevent O
transition O
- O
principly O
make O
sure O
that O
my O
mental O
health O
issues O
looked O
well O
managed, O
or O
however O
they O
put O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
the O
rest O
was O
a O
couple O
of O
general O
mental O
health O
multi-part O
quizes O
I O
think. O
they O
are O
generic, O
so O
could O

again, O
just O
look O

[SEP]
[SEP]

it O

that O

seen O
a O

from O
someone O

hasn't O
(it O
may O
take O
a O
few O

though). O
That O
put O
me O
at O
ease O
but O
still O
very O
nervous O
and O
the O
wait O
times O
for O
endocrinologist O
are O
going O
to O
be O
painful O
(though O
less O

waiting O

Yeah, O
lucky O

me O
most O
my O

My O

for O

was O
about O

about O
10 O

for O

That O
was O
after O

[SEP]
I B-Sexual_Orientation
want I-Sexual_Orientation
to I-Sexual_Orientation
start I-Sexual_Orientation
transitioning I-Sexual_Orientation
but O
im O
not O
sure O
where O
so O
was O
wondering O
if O
anyone O
who O

can O
help O
me O
[SEP]
Yes! O
I B-Sexual_Orientation
began I-Sexual_Orientation
transitioning I-Sexual_Orientation
in O
June O
of O
2021. O
You're O
in O
luck, O
because O
Montreal O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
to O
be O

in O

When O
I O
finally O
came O
out O
to O
myself, O
I O
first O
reached O
out O
to O
a O
therapist O
who O
had O
experience O
with O
trans O
issues O
and O
the O
Montreal O
queer O
community, O
and O
she O
was O
able O
to O
give O
me O
some O
great O
advice. O
If O
you're O
not O
seeing O
a O
therapist, O
I O
do O
recommend O
it O
- O
it O
helped O
me O
immensely. O
They O
can O
be O
really O
good O
resources. O

The O
below O
is O
primarily O
relevant O
if O
you O
are O
over O
18. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
are O
considering O
medically O
transitioning, O
know O
that O
Quebec O
is O
an O
informed O
consent O
province, O
which O
means O
that O
you O
do O
not O
require O
therapy O
prior O
to O
being O
prescribed O
hormones, O
so O
long O
as O
you O
are O
not O
a O
minor. O
Nor O
do O
you O
require O
an O
endocrinologist, O
specifically, O
to O
prescribe O
HRT. O
You'll O
go O
in O
for O
a O
consultation O
and O
they'll O
go O
over O
the O
basics. O
I O
do O
recommend O
doing O
research O
into O
HRT O
first, O
just O
so O
you O
can O
go O
in O
somewhat O
prepared O
with O
any O
questions/concerns. O
(Note O
that, O
unlike O
HRT, O
surgeries, O
you O
will O
typically O
require O
letters O
from O
therapists.) O

I O
initially O

unfortunately, O
my O

to O
a O

You O
may O
have O
to O
face O
some O

times, O
so O
it's O
worth O
reaching O
out O
to O
a O
few O
places. O

are O
the O

Oh, O
I O
should O
also O
note O
that O
I've B-Sexual_Orientation
been I-Sexual_Orientation
socially I-Sexual_Orientation
transitioning I-Sexual_Orientation
for B-Time
just I-Time
about I-Time
a I-Time
year, I-Time
and O
I've O
never O
had O
any O
issues O
here O
(though O
it O
helps O
that O
I'm O
mainly O
downtown, O
and O
I O
still O
mask O
a O
lot O
in O
public O
due O
to O
Covid O

I've O
never O
had O
any O

at O
any O
CLSC, O
hospital, O
SAAQ O
outlet, O
store O
or O
anything. O
I've O
even O
taught O

and O
nobody O
raises O
an O
eyebrow. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
resources O
available O
in O
this O
city O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
have O
such O
a O
large O
and O
vibrant O
queer O
community. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
can't O
promise O
all O
of O
your O
experiences O
will O
be O
positive, O
especially O
if O
you're O
outside O
of O
the O
downtown O
core, O
but O
it's O
certainly O
a O
good O
place O
to O
live O
as O
a O

So O
they O
aren't O
going O
to O
pry O
into O
your O
financial O
situation. O
You'll O
just O
meet O
up O
with O
a O
doctor O
and O
go O
over O
the O
process. O
Explain O
to O
them O
that O
you're O
trans O
and O
that O
you O
want O
to O
start O
HRT. O
They'll O
go O
over O
the O
details, O
and O
you O
can O
ask O
any O
questions O
you O
have. O
You O
might O
want O
to O
look O
into O
benefits, O
risks, O
timelines, O
and O
administration O
methods O
beforehand. O
They'll O
send O
you O
off O
for O
some O
initial O
blood O
work, O
which O
you O
can O
get O
done O
at O
a O
CLSC O
(it O
won't O
cost O
you O
anything). O
The O
appointment O
at O
the O
clinic O
shouldn't' O
cost O
anything, O
or O
if O
it O
does, O
it'll O
be O
a O
small O
administrative O
fee O
(I O
think O
I O
had O
to O
pay O
$10). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
do O
end O
up O
opting O
for O
HRT O
and O
get O
a O
prescription, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
hormones, O
though O
fortunately, O
a O
chunk O
of O
the O
cost O
is O
covered O
by O
RAMQ. O
In O
my O
case, O
I B-Health
started I-Health
off I-Health
with I-Health
estradiol I-Health
(estrogen) I-Health
and I-Health
spironolactone I-Health
(anti-androgen). I-Health
I've O
since O
added O
progesterone, O
and O
my O
pharmacy O
bill O
is O
between O
$35 O
and O
$38 O
per O
month O
for O
the O
three O
drugs. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don't O
know O
how O
long O
the O
waiting O
list O
is O
for O
either O
clinic, O
so O
I O
would O
advise O
reaching O
out O
to O
both O
of O
them. O
If O
you O
do O
get O
an O
appointment O
with O
one O
of O
them, O
you O
can O
always O
let O
the O
other O
clinic O
know O
that O
you O
no O
longer O
need O
their O
services, O
but O
at O
least O
this O
way O
you'll O
be O
seen O
the O
soonest O
possible. O

a O

so O
I O

them. O

you O
also O
know O
if O

the O
same O
pain O
I O
had O
prior. O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
cry. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
took O
4 O
days O
for O
the O
pain O
to O
complete O
subside. O
I O
took O
3 O
off O
of O
work O
to O
rest O
and O
use O
a O
heating O
pad, O
but O
every O
time O
I O
turned O
my O
head O
I O
felt O
the O
same O
pulsation O
of O
pain O
that O
makes O
me O
wince O
and O
feel O
like O
I O
will O
pass O
out. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Went O
last O
week O
feeling O
fine, O
worked O
another O
8 O
hour O
shift O
yesterday O
and O
could O
feel O
it O
coming O
on, O
so O
I O
took O
tylenol O
to O
try O
to O
get O
ahead O
of O
it, O
but O
it O
was O
no O
use. O
I O
immediately O
used O
the O
heating O
pad O
at O
home O
to O
help, O
but O
it O
didn't O
much. O
If O
there O
wasn't O
pain O
in O
my O
neck O
I O
had O
that O
awful O
throbbing O
headache. O
Again O
woke O
up O
throughout O
the O
night O
from O
the O
neck O
pain O
and O
headache. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
wake O
up O
this O
morning, O
and O
snow O
had O
fallen O
heavy, O
but O
we O
figured O
we O
had O
to O
work. O
My B-Relationship_Status
fiance I-Relationship_Status
did I-Relationship_Status
his I-Relationship_Status
stuff I-Relationship_Status
while O
i O
took O
tylenol O
again, O
put O
on O
a O
lidocaine O
patch, O
and O
hoped O
i O
could O
bear O
through O
the O
pain. O
Thanktully O
we O
closed O
the O
restaurant O
so O
i O
was O
able O
to O
go O
back O
home, O
but O
my O
neck O
still O
hurts O
to O
look O
side O
to O
side, O
and O
my O
headache O
has O
been O
relentless O
unless O
I O
am O
sleeping. O

Is O
there O
anything O

I'm B-Other

I O

who O
to O
reach O
out O

A O
chiropractor, O
physical O

a O

I O
am O
in O
such O
pain O

NAD O

I’m O

you’re O

I O

the O

for O

(which O

during O

are O
pretty O
sparse O

sound O
like O
what O
you’re O
doing. O
Some O
docs O
recommend O
tracking O

that O
might O

I O

your O

My O
sister's O
boyfriend O
threw O
a O
plate O
at O
me O
because O
I O
don't O
have O
a O
coffeemaker O
[SEP]
She O
knows O
my O
main O
account O
so O
this O
is O
a O
throwaway O
account. O
She O
asked O
me O
if O
they O
could O
stay O
at O
my O
house O
last O
night O
because O
I O
live O
20 O
minutes O
away O
from O
the O
airport O
versus O
their O
apartment O
being O
an O
hour O
away O
from O
it O
(or O
more O
depending O
on O
traffic). O
I O
don't O
drink O
caffeine O
so O
I O
don't O
have O
a O
coffeemaker. O
This O
morning O
her O
boyfriend O
was O
so O
angry O
about O
there O
not O
being O
coffee O
that O
he O
threw O
a O
plate O
at O
my O
head. O
My O
sister O
excused O
him O
by O
saying O
that O
he's O
a O
"caffeine O
addict" O
and O
that O
he O
gets O
"cranky" O
without O
his O
coffee O
like O
that O
makes O
it O
all O
right. O
And O
she's O
angry O
at O
me O
for O
saying O
he's O
not O
welcome O
at O
my O
house O
now. O
I O
can't O
believe O
he O
thinks O
it O
is O
acceptable O
to O
do O
that. O
I O
asked O
my O
sister O
if O
he's O
ever O
done O
anything O
like O
that O
to O
her O
and O
she O
asked O
if O
I O
was O
calling O
him O
an O

and O
got O
angry O
at O
me. O
[SEP]
Uhhh, O
you O
were O
nice O
enough O
to O
let O
them O
stay O
there O
and O
he O
cant O
slum O
it O
and O
go O
to O
Starbucks O
for O
a O
day? O
What O
the O
fuck, O
there’s O
no O
excuse O
for O
his O
behavior O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
kicked O
him O
out. O

Your O

spelled O
abusive O
asshole, O
wrong. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also, O
she's O
being O
abused. O
It's O
clearly O
been O
normalized O
in O
their O
relationship. O
And O
it O
will O
only O
get O
worse. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Have O
an O
intervention O
for O
her. O
[SEP]
The O
fact O
that O
she O
defended O
him O
is O
possibly O
a O
bigger O
flag O
than O
his O
behaviour. O
It O
would O
appear O
very O
likely O
that O
this O
is O
normal O
behaviour O
for O
him. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Are O
there O
any O
of O
her O
friends/other O
relatives O
you O
trust O
you O
could O
speak O
to O
privately? O
His O
behaviour O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
a O
one O
off, O
and O
your O
sister O
could O
be O
in O
danger. O
[SEP]
Wtf, O
yeah, O
being O
an O
addict O
doesn’t O
excuse O
assault! O
[SEP]
Should O
have O
posted O
this O
on O
your O
regular O

so O
your O

can O
see O
all O
the O
people O
who O
think O
she O
and O
her O
boyfriend O
are O
shit O
heads. O
[SEP]
Did O
you O
immediately O
throw O
his O
ass O
out O
on O
the O
curb? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
yes O
sis, O
he O
is O
an O
abuser O
when O
he O
acts O
abusive! O
[SEP]
I O
bet O
he’s O
done O
much O
worse O
to O
your O

. O
Big O
red O

[SEP]
I’ve O
met O

Sheesh. O
Like O
that’s O
an O
excuse?! O
No O
one O
ever O
died O
from O

Nor O
have O
they O

an O

[SEP]
He O
is O
beating O
her O
ass O
too!!! O
You O
better O
believe O
it.. O
that’s O
why O
she O
ran O
to O
his O
defense… O
[SEP]
I'd O
have O
thrown O
him O
out O
on O
his O
face O
so O
quick O
your O

head O
would O
spin. O

You're O

is O
lucky O
you O
didn't O
press O
charges. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
his O
violent O
outrage O

YOU.. O
would O
make O
me O
very O
concerned O
about O
what O
he O
may O
be O
doing O
to O
HER O
in O
private. O
[SEP]
Thats O
assault. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Use O
the O
correct O
words. O
Its O
not O
clear O
whether O
it O
hit O
or O
not, O
so O
he O
either O
assaulted O
you, O
or O
attempted O
to O
assault O
you. O
Ask O
your O
sister O
why O
you'd O
ever O
welcome O
back O
into O
your O
home O
someone O
who O
thinks O
its O
acceptable O
to O
assault O
you O
because O
they're O
cranky. O

Wait O
wait O
wait… O
he O
threw O
a O
plate O
at O
your O
head?! O
I’m O
sorry, O
but O
this O
**sounds** O
really O
funny, O
but O
are O
you O
ok?! O
A O
plate O
can O
really O
freakin O
hurt, O
can O
cut O
you, O
etc. O
[SEP]
You O

things O
I O

surprise O
me, O

this… O
this O
is O
like O
wtf?!! O
He O
throw O
a O
plate O
at O
your O
head O
for O
not O
having O
Coffee. O
COFFEE!! O
This O
is O
not O
heroine O
or O
crystal O
meth. O
It’s O
f$&kin O
coffee. O
[SEP]
You O
should O
tell O
your O
sister O
that O
he O
assaulted O
you O
and O
is O
not O
welcome O
to O
be O
around O
you O
ever O
again. O

I O
mean O
who O
the O
hell O
throws O
a O
plate??? O
And O
over O
coffee??? O
A O
douche O
bag O
of O
a O
human. O
I O
hope O
your O
head O
is O
ok O
and O
the O
plate O
did O
not O
break. O
[SEP]
He O
is O
an O
abuser!! O
FFS, O
they O
sell O
coffee O
at O
many O
places, O
his O
lazy O
ass O
could O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
one, O
not O
throw O
a O
plate!! O
[SEP]
OP O
tell O
me O
you O
threw O
him O
out O
immediately. O
This O
is O
assault. O
[SEP]
Who O
the O
hell O
throws O
a O
plate O
to O
the O
person O
who O
hosted O
him O
for O
the O
night O
over O
something O
said O
host O
has O
no O

God O
some O

would O
need O
a O
good O
beating. O
Thats O
a O
piece O

trash. O

Emergency O
instant O
coffee O

Shame O
on O
him O
(and O
her) O
for O
not O
sorting O
it O
out O
the O
night O
before. O
Or O
ordering O
something. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
I O
wake O
up O
without O
access O
to O
coffee, O
that O
just O
gets O
me O
up O
earlier O
because O
I O
know O
I O
need O
to O
leave O
the O
house O
or O
hotel O
to O
find O
it O
elsewhere. O

Maintain O

"Addiction" O

no O

I O
would O
have O
told O
him O
he O
has O
5 O
min O
to O
get O
his O
shit O
and O
leave O
or O
i O
call O
the O
cops. O
Also O
there O
is O
no O
way O
he O
isn't O
abusing O
your O
sister, O
i'm O
so O
sorry O
OP. O
[SEP]
You O
should O
report O
the O
matter O
to O
the O
police O
and O
get O
a O
restraining O
order. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
thrilled O
you’re O
not O
injured O
OP! O
And O
very O
proud O
of O
you O
for O
banning O
him O
from O
your O
home!! O
[SEP]
Have O
you O
reported O
him? O
[SEP]
Hmmm, O
he O
strikes O
me O
as O
the O
type O
that O
wouldn't O
behave O
this O
way O
with O
another O
man O
around. O
Not O
a O
good O
look. O
[SEP]
Time O
to O
go O
no O
contact O
for O
both O
of O
them. O
Sorry O
this O
happened. O
[SEP]
So O
he O
threw O
a O
plate O
at O
your O
head O
for O
not O
having O
a O
coffee O
maker. O
I’d O
be O
even O
more O
on O
earned O
at O
what O
he’s O
doing O
to O
her O
behind O
closed O
doors O
when O
he O
doesn’t O
get O
his O
way. O
[SEP]
The O
dude O
sounds O
like O
a O
piece O
of O
shit O
and O
your O
sister O
sounds O
like O
an O
enabler. O
I'm O
glad O
it O
was O
just O
one O
night. O
[SEP]
I O
like O
how O
she O
was O
the O
one O
to O
use O
the O
word O
“abuser” O
when O
you O
asked O
if O
his O
behavior O
was O
consistent. O
And O
then O
she O
was O
mad O
that O
you O
cared O
about O
what O
she O
would O
label O
as O
abuse O
if O
it O
happened O
to O
her. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
wish O
I O
cared O
more O
about O
her O
outcomes, O
but O
you O
can’t O
fix O
this O
sort O
of O
thinking O
for O
her, O
and O
it’s O
probably O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
of O
her O
own O
volition O
for O
years, O
likely O
once O
there O
are O
children O
involved. O
I O
hope O
he’s O
impotent, O
I O
guess. O
It O
would O
be O
best O
to O
let O
her O
know O
that O
you’ll O
be O
around O
if O
she O
leaves O
and O
then O
focus O
on O
other O
things O
until O
that O
day. O
[SEP]
If O
he O
hadn't O
done O
that O
he O
will. O
That O
is O
never O
ok. O
[SEP]
Don’t O
let O
him O
in O
your O
house. O
Don’t O
go O
near O
him O
again. O
[SEP]
I’m O
so O
sorry O
but O
your O
sister O
is O
definitely O
in O
an O
abusive O
relationship. O
She O
is O
just O
not O
ready O
to O
see O
it. O
But O
now O
you O
do O
so O
maybe O
that O
will O
help. O
[SEP]
Rememer O
that O
SHE O
called O
him O
an O
abuser O
not O
you. O
Projection O
fo O
sho O
and O
she O
may O
be O
asking O
for O
help O
without O
asking O
for O
help. O
Keep O
an O
eye O
on O
it! O
[SEP]
Congratulations O
your O
sister O
is O
shit. O
You O
don't O
need O
her O

He’s O
clearly O
unhinged O

mop O

WHAT O
THE O
FUCKKK😭😭😭😭😭 O
[SEP]
You're O
place O
your O
rules. O
An O
if O

he O

out. O

he O
most O

with O
your O

My B-Family
mom, I-Family
my I-Family
dad I-Family

I I-Family
are I-Family
all I-Family
caffeine I-Family

and O
none O

us O
have O
thrown O
objects O
at O
each O
other O
because O
we O
were O
"cranky O
for O
coffee". O
The O
man's O
behaviour O
is O
ludicrous O
and O
so O
is O
your O
sisters O
justification O
of O
it. O
I'd O
give O
her O
an O
ultimatum O
since O
she O
clearly O
loves O
living O
in O
denial. O
[SEP]
Yea O
I O
drink O
caffeine O
every O
day O
and O
I’ve O
never O
assaulted O
someone O
because O
I O
didn’t O
have O
it, O
he O
isn’t O
an O

he’s O
just O
a O
piece O
of O
shit. O
I’m O
really O
tired O
of O
people O
using O
addictions O
as O
an O
excuse O
to O
act O
shitty O
[SEP]
If O
that's O
his O
reaction O
over O
something O
as O
petty O
as O
coffee, O
imagine O
what O
he's O
like O
with O
things O
that O
actually O
matter. O
Dude O
sounds O
like O

I’m O
a O
caffeine O
addict, O
but O
all O
I O
do O
is O
grumble, O
drink O
some O
water, O

plot O
how O

get O
the O
sweet O

of O

[SEP]
I O
don’t O
turn O
into O
an O
overgrown O

mad O
because O
someone O
took O
away O
my O
favorite O
toy. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If, O
for O
some O
bizarre O
reason O
I O
did O
throw O
a O

tantrum, O
my O

be O
gone O
faster O

a O

[SEP]
Yes. O
He O
has O
done O
stuff O

that O

her. O

my.gf I-Wife_GF
threw I-Wife_GF
a I-Wife_GF
plate I-Wife_GF
at I-Wife_GF
my I-Wife_GF

head, I-Wife_GF
I O
definitely O
wouldn't O

defending O

behaviour O
[SEP]
Uh.... O
I'd O
of O
cracked O
the O
fucker O
in O
the O

with O
a O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Neither O
my O

her O
asshole O
would O
be O
allowed O
in O
my O
house O
after O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
What O
the O
fuck. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
fact O
that O
your O
sister O
got O
defensive O
when O
you O
asked O
if O
he O
had O
ever O
done O
that O
to O
her O
means O
yes O
he O
has O
100% O
done O
that O
to O
her O
and O
she's O
normalized O
it. O
[SEP]
>She O
knows O
my O
main O
account O
so O
this O
is O
a O
throwaway O
account. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Ah O
yes, O
very O
clever, O
she'll O
never O
find O
out O
now O
[SEP]
She's O
totally O
being O
abused. O
[SEP]
Coffee O

are O

[SEP]
Wow O
imagine O
what O
he O
does O
to O
your O
sister. O
You O
need O
to O
get O
your O
parents O
if O
you O
can O
and O
get O
her O
outta O
there O
[SEP]
Should O
have O
punched O
him O
[SEP]
that's O
the O
definition O
of O
an O
abuser. O
consult O
with O
your O
parents, O
she O
definitely O
needs O
your O
help. O
[SEP]
He’s O
already O
proven O
he’s O
an O
abuser. O
If O
your O
sister O
thinks O
this O
is O
acceptable O
behavior, O
she’s O
a O
willing O
victim. O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
someone O
is O
protecting O
an O
abuser. O
I'm O
guessing O
they've O
been O
together O
for O
a O
while, O
and O
she O
doesn't O
want O
to O
leave O
a O
long O
term O
relationship? O
What O
do O
your O
parents/siblings O
have O
to O
say O
on O
the O
matter? O
I'm O
kind O
of O
surprised O
you O
didn't O
call O
police O
on O
him, O
that's O
vandalism, O
destruction O
of O
private O
property, O
and O
assault O
(at O
least O
in O
my O
state) O
[SEP]
Oh, O
she O
is O
being O
abused!!! O
Maybe O
not O
physically, O
yet, O
but O
surely O
some O
emotional O
or O
psychological O
abuse. O
Her O
quick O
defense O
of O
his O
actions O
without O
a O
true O
apology, O
and O
her O
anger O
at O
the O
mention O
of O
it O
are O
telltale O
signs. O
[SEP]
Blunt O
force O
trauma O
to O
the O
head O
is O
considered O
deadly O
force, O
same O
level O
as O
shooting O
someone O
in O
many O
states. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
While O
you O
might O
not O
able O
to O
get O
that O
charge, O
you O
certainly O
can O
at O

get O
an O

charge O
on O
that O
asshole. O

I O

on O
about O
how O

how O
first-wave O
coffee O
culture O

the O

in O
the O

how O
Starbucks O
contributed O

why O
I O
choose O
a O

both O

I B-Interests

[SEP]
This O

[SEP]
As B-Gender
a I-Gender
man I-Gender
who O
loves O
coffee O
(only O
drink O
it O
black) O
and O
has O
multiple O
cups O
in O
the O
morning. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He's O
not O
a O
caffeine O

he's O
a O
giant O
man-child O
asshole O
who O
I O
wouldn't O
ever O
help O
again. O
[SEP]
caffeine O
is O
not O
cocaine. O
its O
not O
that O
addicting. O
the O
guy O
is O
just O
a O
violent O
piece O
of O
shit. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
i O
drink O
coffee. O
its O
not O
very O
addicting. O
I O
drink O
cause O
i O
like O
the O
warmth O
in O
the O
morning. O
i O
can O
easily O
got O
weeks O
without O
having O
it. O
[SEP]
Yup O
she's O
abused O
[SEP]
Wow, O
This O
is O
about O
coffee, O
But O
that O
idiot O
guy O
is O
going O
on O
like O
he's O
a O
heroine O
addict, O
Also O
make O
sure O
he O
isn't O
abusing O
your O
sister, O
And O
if O
he O
shouts O
alot, O
Get O
a O
bigger O
guy O
to O
go O
have O
a O
chat O
with O
that O
little O
boy. O
[SEP]
He O
is O
an O
abuser O
throwing O
a O
plate O
at O
someone O
bc O
they O
don’t O
own O
a O
coffee O
maker O
is O
deranged O
and O
abusive. O
You O
need O
to O
tell O
your O
family, O
your O
sister O
is O
most O
likely O
in O
an O
abusive O
relationship O
based O
on O
how O
she O
excused O
his O
horrid O
behavior O
[SEP]
What O
a O
fucking O
man O
child O
I'm O
sure O
he's O
done O
shit O
like O
that O
to O
your O
sister O
and O
that O
is O
ridiculous. O
you O
are O
in O
the O
right O
to O
not O
have O
him O
over O
at O
your O
home O
anymore. O
[SEP]
What O
is O
with O
all O
of O
these O
crybaby O
men O
who O
flip O
out O
and O
start O
throwing O
stuff O
when O
they O
get O
angry? O
The O
situation O
you O
described O
is O
really O
concerning. O
I O
hope O
your O
sister O
will O
come O
to O
her O
senses O
and O
realize O
this O
type O
of O
thing O
could O
and O
likely O
will O
increasingly O
escalate. O
I O
applaud O
you O
for O
being O
as O
calm O
and O
level O
headed O
as O
you O
were. O
[SEP]
He O
probably O
hits O
her O
as O
well. O
☹️ O
[SEP]
You O
need O
to O
check O
that O
dude. O
There’s O
disagreements O
and O
then O
there’s O
just O
being O
disrespectful. O
If O
you O
don’t O
take O
care O
of O
it O
now O
it O
will O
get O
worse. O
[SEP]
Honestly, O
I’d O
press O
charges O
if O
you O
can. O
Though O
I O
imagine O
your O
sister, O
the O
only O
witness, O
would O
lie O
to O
the O
cops O
when O
interrogated. O
Post O
this O
to O
your O
main O
account O
bc O
she O
needs O
to O
see O
that O
no, O
this O
isn’t O
him O
being O
“cranky” O
(is O
he O
a O
fucking O
toddler?!?!), O
it’s O
abuse. O
[SEP]
>I O
asked O
my O
sister O
if O
he's O
ever O
done O
anything O
like O
that O
to O
her O
and O
she O
asked O
if O
I O
was O
calling O
him O
an O
abuser O
and O
got O
angry O
at O
me. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Ok, O
so O
atleast O
your O
sister O
is O
not O
100% O
delusional O
and O
realizes O
that O
plate O
throwing O
falls O
under O
abusive O
behavior. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
>My O
sister O
excused O
him O
by O
saying O
that O
he's O
a O
"caffeine O
addict" O
and O
that O
he O
gets O
"cranky" O
without O
his O
coffee O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
he's O
so O
much O
of O
an O
addict O
that O
he O
has O
no O
control O
over O
his O
own O
actions?? O
And O
your O
sister O
is O
ok O
with O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
would O
advise O
you O
to O
be O
kind O
to O
your O
sister O
and O
provide O
her O
with O
a O
safe O
place O
should O
she O
want O
to O
leave O
him. O
He O
may O
not O
have O
thrown O
things O
at O
her O
but O
he O
is O
definitely O
abusive O
to O
her O
in O
other O
ways, O
and O
she O
can't O
leave. O
[SEP]
Hed O
be O
out O
on O
the O
street O
the O
same O
minute O
he O
threw O
my O
property O
to O
my O
head O
inside O
my O
own O
house. O
[SEP]
Insane O
stuff. O
[SEP]
Well, O
if O
it O
throws O
a O
plate O
like O
an O
abuser... O
[SEP]
Don't O
even O
talk O
to O
the O
prick O
at O
family O
events O
what O
a O
garbage O
person O
[SEP]
That's O
messed O
up. O
I O
am O
a O
caffeine O
addict O
myself O
but O
I O
have O
never O
thrown O
any O
objects O
because O
I O
couldn't O
get O
a O
fix. O
[SEP]
And O
there O
should O
be O
plenty O
of O
ways O
for O
him O
to O
get O
coffee O
without O
resorting O
to O
violence. O
[SEP]
Fuck O
that O
guy! O
[SEP]
He O
might O
be O
abusive O
and O
your O
sister O
is O
still O
in O
denial. O
Do O
not O
let O
him O
back O
in O
your O
house O
again. O
Remain O
firm. O
And O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
your O
sister O
for O
bruises O
or O
anything O
else O
that O
could O
indicate O
he’s O
hurting O
her. O
[SEP]
Damn, O
he’s O
normalized O
this O
behavior O
that O
he O
was O
comfortable O
enough O
to O
do O
it O
to O
you, O
in O
your O
own O
house. O
Tell O
other O
family O
members O
and O
help O
her O
get O
iut O
of O
there O
[SEP]
Yeah O
he's O
kicking O
her O
azz. O
You O
did O
the O
right O
thing. O
If O
sis O
is O
pissed O
she O
should O
stay O
the O
hell O
away O
too. O
What O
sister O
allows O
her O
immature O
boy O
toy O
to O
act O
so O
aggressively O
towards O
her O
own O
sister O
? O
[SEP]
Your O
sister O
is O
100% O
being O
abused O
and O
she's O
in O
the O
idiot O
phase O
of O
it O
now O
- O
which O
is O
denial. O
Tell O
your O
family O
ASAP. O
I O
would O
also O
report O
him. O
[SEP]
Your O
sister O
is O
regarded O
[SEP]
Yeah O
that O
right O
there O
is O
assault. O
A O
crime. O
Tell O
your O
sister O
neither O
of O
them O
are O
ever O
allowed O
back O
there O
and O
should O
be O
more O
grateful O
you O
didn't O
press O
charges O
because O
I O
would O
have O
[SEP]
She's O
probably O
being O
abused O
herself, O
and O
in O
denial O
about O
it O
(thus O
the O
question O
of O
"are O
you O
calling O
him O
an O
abuser?"). O
You're O
absolutely O
justified O
in O
not O
allowing O
him O
around O
you O
any O
more O
- O
that O
was O
in O
no O
way O
acceptable. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I'm O
sorry O
that O
you're O
going O
through O
that O
- O
I O
hope O
you O
can O
stay O
in O
contact O
with O
your O
sister. O
She'll O
probably O
need O
it. O
If O
he's O
comfortable O
enough O
to O
do O
something O
like O
that O
around O
you, O
imagine O
how O
he O
acts O
around O
her. O
It O
might O
be O
worth O
it O
to O
ask O
her O
who O
else O
is O
calling O
him O
an O
abuser O
- O
but O
make O
sure O
she O
knows O
that O
you O
love O
her O
and O
are O
going O
to O
be O
there O
for O
HER, O
just O
not O
HIM. O
He O
may O
already O
be O
trying O
to O
isolate O
her O
from O
her O
support O
network. O
After O
all, O
that's O
what O
abusers O
do. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Stay O
safe, O
OP. O
[SEP]
"I'm O
withdrawing O
from O
my O
socially O
accepted O
addiction O
so O
I O
have O
a O
pass O
yo O
assault O
you." O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Fuck. O
That. O
[SEP]
If O
the O
sister O
is O
rationalizing O
that O
type O
of O
behavior… O
eek. O
She’s O
either O
as O
bad O
as O
him O
or O
is O
desensitized O
because O
he O
always O
is O
like O
this/abuses O
her O
(the O
latter O
feels O
more O
likely). O
That O
is O
a O
level O
ten O
reaction O
to O
a O
non-infraction. O
I O
hope O
you’re O
okay, O
OP. O
[SEP]
Holy O
shit O
if O
he O
has O
the O
gumption O
to O
do O
this O
to O
you, O
imagine O
what O
he’s O
doing O
to O
your O
sister O
behind O
closed O
doors. O
This O
is O
not O
cranky. O
This O
is O
abusive O
and O
batshit O
crazy. O
[SEP]
Thays O
beyond O
being O
cranky O
about O
not O
getting O
caffeine. O
That O
was O
a O
tantrum O
how O
big O
a O
deal O
would O
it O
be O
to O
just O
go O
get O
some O
at O
a O
gas O
station O
or O
something? O
[SEP]
Call O
it O
what O
it O
is. O
He's O
physically O
abusive. O
[SEP]
He’s O
an O
abuser O
[SEP]
Dude... O
[SEP]
I O
mean O
you're O
so O
in O
the O
right O
I O
don't O
have O
much O
to O
add O
except O
I'm O
worried O
about O
your O
sister O
[SEP]
Get O
a O
fucking O
coffee O
maker, O
not O
rocket O
science O
[SEP]
This O
was O
my O
first O
thought O
too. O
There O
are O
plenty O
of O
places O
to O
grab O
coffee. O
Hell, O
the O
airport O
will O
have O
it O
if O
you O
don't O
pass O
one O
of O
the O
other O
dozen O
places O
you O
can O
buy O
a O
cup O
on O
the O
way. O
[SEP]
Should O
have O
called O
the O
police O
for O
assault. O
[SEP]
That O
definetly O
is O
abusive O
behaviours. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
also O
get O
cranky O
when O
I O
don\`t O
get O
coffee O
in O
the O
morning. O
You O
know O
what O
I O
do? O
I O
would O
look O
if O
I O
could O
get O
one O
somewhere O
else O
and O
if O
not O
I O
sulk O
inside O
myself O
for O
like O
5 O
minutes O
and O
then O
I O
get O
over O
it O
and O
move O
on. O
[SEP]
Yup O
she O
got O
Stockholm O
[SEP]
Yup. O
She O
didn’t O
answer O
the O
question O
with O
“No, O
never!”, O
she O
answered O
it O
with O
another O
question. O
Way O
to O
dance O
around O
the O
obvious. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
OP, O
you O
need O
to O
make O
yourself O
available O
to O
sister O
if O
ever O
she O
needs O
help O
getting O
away. O
[SEP]
Exactly. O
The O
bf O
is O
an O
abusive O
idiot O
and O
there O
is O
a O
big O
chance O
the O
sister O
is O
in O
denial O
of O
being O
abused. O
Could O
help O
to O
open O
her O
eyes. O
[SEP]
She's O
an O
abuse O
victim O
a O
d O
I'd O
be O
surprised O
if O
he O
doesn't O
already O
beat O
her O
[SEP]
Me O
too, O
except O
privately...no O
coffee O
means O
I O
have O
a O
legitimate O
excuse O
to O
go O
out O
for O
expresso. O
Out O
of O
milk? O
Guess O
I'll O
need O
to O
pop O
out O
and O
grab O
a O
cappuccino! O
[SEP]
My O
first O
thought, O
too. O
Like O
how O
many O
people’s O
sister’s O
boyfriends O
have O
thrown O
plates O
at O
their O
heads O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
coffeemaker? O
Can’t O
be O
more O
than O
half O
a O
dozen. O
I O
think O
sister O
may O
make O
the O
connection O
here… O
[SEP]
Missing O
the O
point O
here O
[SEP]
Damn O
bro O
completely O
over O
your O

It’s O
quite O
cute O
that O
at O

you O
say O
you O
are O
young, O
but O
getting O
old. O
I O
assure O
you, O
28 O
is O
still O
young, O
young! O
This O
is O
the O
time O

little O
dream O
in O
your O

to O
have O
the O
trendy O

in O
the O
big O

there, O
done O
that, O
forever O
grateful O
I O

do O
that! O
I B-Location

UK I-Location
when B-Age
I I-Age

a I-Occupation
fashion I-Occupation
photographer, I-Occupation
dated B-Relationship_Status
foreign I-Relationship_Status
men, I-Relationship_Status
weekends O
in O
Paris, O
etc. O
Glad O
I O
did O
it, O
and O
it O
also O
made O
me O
more O
comfortable O
now O
with O
a O
slower O
pace O
of O
life, O
having O
that O
out O
of O
the O
system. O
I O
believe O
you O
have O
a O
desire O
for O
exploration O
of O
yourself O
for O
a O
reason. O
If O
you O
want O
to O
take O
emotions O
out O
of, O
statistically, O
majority O
of O
people O
end O
up O
married, O
and O
most O
with O
a O
family, O
so O
that O
dream O
is, O
in O
a O
sense, O
almost O
inevitable, O
unless O
it’s O
something O
you O
choose O
not O
to O
partake O
in. O
However, O
the O
dream O
of O
the O
big O
city O
is O
not O
something O
that O
will O
happen O
unless O
you O
actively O
seek O
it O
out. O
Much O
easier O
(and O
way O
more O
fun) O
to O
do O
in O
your O
late O
20’s, O
then O
never O
have O
done O
it, O
and O
truly O
to O
re-live O
it O
later O
in O
life. O
Not O
to O
say O
it O
can’t O
happen, O
but O
it O
will O
likely O
be O
harder. O
Neither O
choice O
is O
“wrong” O
but O
think O
of O
which O
one O
might O
be O
easier O
to O
pivot O
from, O
should O
you O
wish O
to. O

the O

someone O
always O
gets O
creamed” O
has O
been O
true O

most O
seem O
to O

they O
wouldn’t. O
Or O
some O
say O
it’s O
only O
worth O
it O

From O
a O
different, O
more O
practical O
standpoint: O
what’s O
the O
plan O
with O
your O
house? O
Are O
you O
expected O
to O
sell O
it? O
Is O
the O
expectation O
that O
you’d O
use O
that O
money O
on O
a O
down O
payment O
on O
a O
joint O
place? O
I O
100% O
recommend O
against O
commingling O
long O
term O
investments O
in O
your O
future, O
like O
real O
estate, O
with O
someone O
you O
are O
not O
married O
to. O
This O
could O
become O
a O
real O
nightmare O

you O
were O
to O
separate. O

homeowner O

seeing O
how O
leaving O

I B-Relationship_Status
married I-Relationship_Status
my I-Relationship_Status
DH(51) I-Relationship_Status
at B-Age
41 I-Age
and O
I O
wouldn't O
trade O
him O
for O
the O
world. O
His O
youngest O
is O
14 O
so O
just O
a O
few O
short O
years O
of O
being O
free O
from O
BM, O
child O
support, O
etc. O
No O
way O
I O
could O
have O
coped O
with O
this O
with O
young O
kids O
where O
theres O
no O
light O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
tunnel. O
When O
I O
was O
your O
age O
I O
would O
have O
never O
dated O
someone O
with O
kids. O
Really, O
it's O
all O
those O
child O
free O
years O
I O
lived O
before O
my O
DH O
doing O
whatever O
I O
wanted O
that O
keeps O
me O
sane O
in O
my O

you’ve O

[SEP]
I O
HAVE O
BEEN O
THERE. O
I'm O
sure O
every O
teacher O
felt O
that O
in O
their O
first O
year. O
I O
became O
so O
mentally O
exhausted O
in O
my O
first O
year O
that O
I O
became O
physically O
ill O
and O
ended O
up O
having O
a O
short O
hospital O
stay. O
A O
lot O
of O
the O
comments O
here O
suggest O
not O
working O
beyond O
contracted O
hours. O
I O
don't O
find O
this O
feasible; O
the O
days O
are O
less O
stressful O
when O
you O
are O
prepared. O
Instead O
of O
this, O
I O
would O
suggest O
setting O
an O
end O
time O
for O
your O
day. O
My O
day O
ends O
at O
3:12 O
and O
I O
allow O
myself O
to O
work O
until O
4:30 O
and O
then O
I O
go O
home. O
Being O
your O
first O
year, O
you O
are O
likely O
going O
to O
need O
more O
time. O
Other O
things O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
are: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
don't O
have O
to O
mark O
everything. O
Choose O
your O
key O
assessment O
pieces. O
Depending O
on O
the O
grade, O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
work O
is O
practice. O
Sometimes O
I'll O
choose O
one O
question O
on O
an O
assignment O
that O
best O
reflects O
the O
learning O
outcome, O
and O
score O
only O
that O
question. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It's O
okay O
to O
give O
yourself O
some O
quiet O
time. O
Your O
students O
can O
do O
silent O
reading O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
you O
can O
take O
a O
breather O
if O
you O
need O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Don't O
reinvent O
the O
wheel. O
Reach O
out O
to O
other O
teachers O
in O
your O
school O
or O
district O
and O
ask O
if O
they O
have O
resources O
or O
lesson O
plans O
that O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
share. O
Sure O
a O
lesson O
might O
not O
be O
perfect O
but O
if O
you're O
already O
overwhelmed O
it's O
better O
than O
burning O
out. O
The O
kids O
will O
not O
suffer O
because O
you O
don't O
have O
a O
perfect O
lesson O
plan O
every O
time. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
like O
the O
other O
comments O
say, O
don't O
worry O
too O
much O
about O
extra O
curricular O
things. O
Pick O
one. O
You O
don't O
have O
to O
be O
a O
hero O
and O
stretch O
yourself O
thin. O
[SEP]
First O
off, O
remember O
that O
**there O
is O
no O
obligation O
to O
stay O
in O
this O
field**. O
This O
field O
is O
under-valued O
and O
over-worked. O
You're O
always, O
always, O
always O
within O
your O
rights O
to O
say O
"fuck O
this" O
and O
go O
home. O
Being O
a O
teacher O
isn't O
a O
"calling," O
it O
isn't O
a O
path O
to O
"saving O
the O
world." O
It's O
something O
you O
do O
to O
put O
food O
on O
the O
table O
and O
money O
in O
your O
pension O
account. O
So O
don't O
feel O
any O
shame O
if O
you O
decide O
that O
this O
isn't O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**If O
you O
stay O
in O
teaching, O
some O
of O
these O
problems O
will O
alleviate O
over O
time.** O
Eventually, O
you'll O
finish O
your O
grad O
degree. O
If O
you O
stay O
in O
the O
same O
content O
area O
for O
a O
while O
(which O
I O
advise) O
you'll O
expand O
your O
bank O
of O
activities O
and O
teaching O
resources, O
which O
will O
streamline O
your O
planning O
time O
considerably. O
If O
you O
stay O
in O
the O
same O
building, O
you'll O
develop O
a O
sense O
for O
which O
tasks O
are O
avoidable O
bullshit, O
which O
tasks O
are O
unavoidable O
bullshit, O
and O
which O
tasks O
are O
actually O
worth O
investing O
time O
in. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**Remember, O
they O
need O
you O
more O
than O
you O
need O
them.** O
Admin, O
students, O
parents, O
and O
society O
at O
large O
WILL O
try O
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
your O
efforts O
and O
accomplishments O
as O
a O
teacher O
are O
insufficient. O
Ignore O
them. O
These O
people O
literally O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
they're O
talking O
about O
and O
they O
would O
collapse O
if O
placed O
in O
your O
shoes. O
Sometimes, O
other O
teachers O
will O
try O
to O
tear O
you O
down. O
Ignore O
them, O
too. O
They're O
just O
bitter O
fucks O
trying O
to O
assuage O
their O
own O
anxiety. O
**The O
fact O
that O
you O
are O
here O
at O
all O
means O
you've O
gone O
above O
and O
beyond**. O
There's O
absolutely O
no O
obligation O
to O
be O
an O
award-winning O
teacher, O
a O
"transformative O
educator," O
or O
any O
of O
that O
other O
highfalutin O
bullshit. O
If O
you O
just O
do O
your O
job O
consistently O
at O
a O
minimal O
level, O
you're O
contributing O
more O
to O
society O
than O
most O
other O
members O
of O
the O
workforce. O
Even O
if O
all O
you O
do O
is O
sit O
there O
and O
make O
sure O
none O
of O
the O
kids O
die, O
you're O
fulfilling O
an O
essential O
and O
undervalued O
social O
function. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**In O
the O
mean O
time, O
take O
care O
of O
yourself**. O
Schedule O
as O
many O
sick O
days O
and O
personal O
days O
as O
you O
can O
afford. O
(I O
say O
afford, O
NOT O
justify. O
At O
this O
point, O
you O
don't O
need O
to O
justify O
yourself O
to O
anybody. O
You're O
fighting O
for O
your O
survival O
and O
nobody O
is O
entitled O
to O
your O
labor.) O
Reach O
out O
to O
your O
friends O
and O
family O
to O
let O
them O
know O
you O
need O
extra O
support O
right O
now. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**Some O
practical O
tips O
for O
your O
well-being:** O
Buy O
a O
slowcooker. O
Fill O
it O
1x O
every O
day O
or O
two O
with O
enough O
beans, O
rice, O
and O
frozen O
veggies O
to O
make O
as O
many O
meals O
as O
you'll O
need. O
It'll O
get O
a O
bit O
repetitive O
but O
it's O
easy O
to O
clean, O
nutritious, O
and O
having O
a O
hot O
filling O
meal O
every O
day O
will O
comfort O
you O
in O
a O
way O
that O
microwave O
meals O
will O
not. O
If O
you're O
a O
coffee O
drinker, O
consider O
buying O
a O
few O
bottles O
of O
cold O
brew O
each O
week O
for O
mornings O
when O
you're O
too O
tired O
to O
brew O
a O
fresh O
pot. O
[SEP]
As O
a O
teacher O
of O
16 O
years, O
I O
feel O
you. O
If O
I O
could O
go O
back, O
I’d O
pick O
a O
different O
career. O
Wish O
you O
well. O
[SEP]
I B-Occupation
had I-Occupation
to I-Occupation
quit I-Occupation
teaching I-Occupation
after B-Other
becoming I-Other
a I-Other
mother. I-Other
I O
couldn’t O
be O
good O
at O
both. O
I O
found O
that O
it O
never O
got O
that O
much O
easier O
over O
the O
years. O
Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
district O
I O
worked O
in O
that O
was O
the O
problem O
though. O
[SEP]
Yo! O
I’m B-Occupation
also I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
first I-Occupation
year I-Occupation
teacher I-Occupation
and O
finishing B-Education
my I-Education
masters I-Education
and I-Education
going I-Education
through I-Education
Induction. I-Education
So O
I O
feel O
your O
pain. O
There’s O
literally O
no O
time O
left O
in O
the O
day O
to O
breathe. O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
let O
you O
know, O
that O
you’re O
not O
the O
only O
one!! O
[SEP]
People O
always O
say O
to O
“just O
work O
contract O
hours O
and O
you’ll O
figure O
it O
out O
when O
you O
get O
there O
the O
next O
day”, O
but O
it’s O
a O
little O
more O
challenging O
to O
figure O
it O
out O
the O
morning O
of O
when O
you’re O
a O
new O
teacher O
have O
no O
fucking O
clue O
on O
what O
you’re O
doing, O
the O
lesson O
you’re O
teaching, O
or O
how O
to O
manage O
a O
class. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
One O
suggestion O
that O
has O
really O
saved O
me, O
is O
that O
if O
you O
know O
any O
teachers O
in O
the O
district O
that O
teach O
the O
same O
thing O
as O
you, O
don’t O
be O
ashamed O
to O
ask O
for O
all O
of O
the O
stuff O
they O
have O
and O
their O
planning O
methods. O
Finding O
ways O
to O
“cheat” O
the O
system O
and O
not O
create O
things O
from O
scratch O
helps. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
want O
to O
DM O
me O
and O
we O
can O
vent O
to O
each O
other, O
feel O
free! O
[SEP]
First O
year O
teachers O
are O
given O
more O
sick O
days O
than O
veteran O
teachers O
in O
most O
districts. O
And O
that’s O
for O
a O
reason. O
You O
are O
expected O
to O
feel O
run O
down O
you O
first O
few O
years O
as O
you O
build O
up O
your O
immunity O
to O
all O
the O
germs O
and O
the O
energy O
coming O
at O
you O
all O
day O
/ O
every O
day. O
It O
gets O
better. O
Use O
those O
days. O
Not O
more O
than O
once O
a O
month. O
And O
not O
the O
months O
with O
many O
days O
off. O
You O
don’t O
want O
to O
be O
spoken O
to O
for O
attendance. O
I O
take O
a O
mental O
health O
day O
in O
October, O
sometime O
between O
January O
and O
February O
and O
again O
between O
March O
and O
summer. O
This O
stretch O
your O
in O
is O
the O
longest. O
Christmas O
break O
is O
around O
the O
corner. O
This O
is O
my O
17th O
year O
and O
feel O
you O
with O
the O
exhaustion. O
But O
that’s O
because O
I O
taught O
my O
day O
class, O
afternoon O
class, O
and O
night O
classes O
today O
as O
I O
do O
every O
M/W. O
This O
exhaustion O
is O
temporary. O
You’ll O
build O
up O
your O
stamina. O
Message O
me O
if O
you’d O
like O
to O
chat. O
[SEP]
Okay, O
if O
you O
could O
postpone O
grad O
school, O
do O
it. O
That’s O
too O
much O
right O
there. O
First O
year O
teaching O
is O
hard O
enough. O
You O
don’t O
want O
anything O
else O
on O
your O
plate. O
I O
waited O
until O
year O
4 O
to O
begin O
grad O
school. O
I O
b O
wouldn’t O
have O
been O
able O
to O
do O
so O
in O
my O
first O
year. O
[SEP]
Also, O
allow O
yourself O
grace. O
It O
will O
and O
f O
does O
get O
better, O
trust O
me!! O
Don’t O
aim O
for O
perfection. O
Do O
your O
best O
and O
don’t O
try O
to O
do O
it O
all. O
[SEP]
Next O
year O
will O
be O
easier O
because O
you’ll O
have O
classroom O
management O
experience O
and O
lessons O
you’ve O
saved. O
You’ll O
get O
there. O

[SEP]
I O
think O
teaching O
is O
different, O
now. O
The O
workload O
is O
astronomical, O
and O
the O
schools O
operate O
like O
cults O
that O
demand O
every O
minute O
of O
your O
time, O
including O
unpaid O
time. O
While O
grad O
school O
is O
difficult O
to O
do O
while O
you're O
teaching O
(I O
did O
this O
early O
on O
in O
my O
career.), O
something O
strange O
and O
concerning O
is O
happening O
in O
education. O
The O
role O
I O
once O
held O
has O
become O
so O
untenable, O
I O
resigned O
from O
my O
district O
recently O
due O
to O
multiple O
instances O
of O
toxic O
work O
environment. O
It O
seems O
my O
role O
now O
includes O
being O
bullied, O
and O
Idk O
if O
it O
is O
falling O
down O
the O
stairs O
at O
work, O
being O
evaluated O
by O
admin O
with O
no O
teaching O
experience, O
getting O
covid O
and O
subsequent O
struggles O
with O
cognition, O
fatigue, O
mood O
regulation, O
and O
joint O
pain, O
lock O
down O
drills, O
being O
falsely O
accused O
of O
abuse, O
being O
underpaid O
commensurate O
with O
my O
experience O
by O
administration, O
but O
it O
hardly O
seems O
worth O
all O
this O
effort, O
anymore. O
I O
am O
searching O
for O
the O
next O
thing, O
as O
this O
teaching O
business O
doesn't O
seem O
like O
something O
I O
want O
to O
participate O
in, O
anymore...it O
seems O
like O
post-pandemic, O
the O
expectations O
are O
outrageous O
on O
the O
part O
of O
school O
officials. O
I O
don't O
care O
for O
this O
trend O
of O
hiring O
bullies O
and O
retaining O
bullies O
into O
high O
positions, O
either. O
It's O
as O
if O
the O
powers O
that O
be O
want O
to O
intentionally O
fuck O
the O
kids O
up O
by O
exposing O
them O
to O
assholes O
all O
day O
so O
that O
they O
wind O
up O
in O
one O
of O
their O
prisons O
or O
mental O
hospitals.. O
[SEP]
That's O
because O
you're O
always O
*on* O
when O
you're O
teaching. O
No O
spacing O
out O
and O
dicking O
around O
on O
your O
phone, O
no O
time O
to O
breathe. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Look O
into O
meal O
prep O
and O
try O
doing O
it O
on O
your O
weekends. O
A O
slow O
cooker, O
Instant O
Pot, O
and/or O
air O
fryer O
are O
your O
best O
friends O
for O
low O
effort O
cooking. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also O
try O
building O
in O
group O
work O
and O
independent O
work O
time O
to O
give O
yourself O
and O
your O
students O
breaks. O
[SEP]
it O
gets O
better. O
My O
first O
years O
was O
very O
similar. O
the O
first O
6 O
months O
is O
the O
absolute O
worst. O
next O
year O
will O
be O
measurably O
better O
and O
year O
three O
i O
finally O
felt O
like O
i O
was O
teaching O
and O
doing O
well. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
manage O
your O
expectation. O
teaching O
is O
a O
skill. O
it O
helped O
me O
to O
focus O
on O
getting O
better O
in O
specific O
areas O
instead O
of O
just O
being O
sad/angry O
that O
i O
was O
wasnt O
good O
[SEP]
[SEP]
i O
used O
to O
just O
take O
a O
nap O
after O
work O
for O
about O
25 O
minutes O
just O
so O
i O
could O
do O
stuff. O
[SEP]
Almost O
no O
one O
ever O
becomes O
a O
"good" O
teacher. O
What O
is O
asked O
of O
us, O
especially O
in O
this O
country, O
is O
essentially O
impossible O
to O
do O
well. O
So O
be O
realistic O
and O
accept O
that O
you O
are O
just O
learning O
to O
become O
the O
best O
teacher O
you O
can O
be. O
Don't O
try O
to O
be O
perfect O
and O
certainly O
don't O
worry O
too O
much O
about O
what O
the O
staff O
and O
faculty O
think O
of O
you O
as O
a O
"teacher". O
If O
you O
do O
this, O
you O
will O
work O
yourself O
into O
the O
ground O
(likely O
with O
little O
to O
no O
reward). O
Stick O
to O
your O
core O
values O
as O
a O
person O
and O
as O
a O
teacher. O
Be O
faithful O
to O
these O
and O
you O
will O
naturally O
gain O
the O
right O
skills O
for O
YOU O
to O
build O
the O
type O
of O
classroom O
culture O
YOU O
dream O
of! O
Over O
time, O
probably O
after O
several O
years, O
you O
will O
see O
things O
come O
together. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
a O
first O
year, O
you O
will O
probably O
fuck O
up O
a O
lot. O
Observe O
your O
coworkers O
when O
you O
can O
(even O
if O
it's O
just O
hearing O
them O
out O
at O
staff O
meetings O
or O
checking O
out O
how/what O
they've O
decorated O
their O
classrooms O
with). O
Take O
note O
of O
what O
inspires O
you, O
try O
out O
their O
approaches. O
Take O
note O
of O
what O
they O
do O
that O
you O
notice O
doesn't O
work O
too! O
(Especially O
things O
the O
students O
react/respond O
poorly O
to.) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Work O
within O
your O
work O
hours. O
Remember O
that O
playing O
with O
your O
cat O
is O
more O
important O
than O
volunteering/giving O
free O
labor O
to O
work. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Bask O
in O
your O
graduate O
education. O
There O
should O
be O
several O
tools O
and O
philosophies O
you O
learn O
there O
too. O
Just O
copy O
and O
paste O
for O
now O
to O
apply O
to O
classroom. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Sorry O
my O
writing O
is O
all O
over O
the O
place. O
I O
hope O
you O
feel O
better O
soon! O
Keep O
asking O
for O
support! O
[SEP]
My O
first O
year O
I O
came O
home O
and O
napped O
most O
days. O
I O
slept O
in O
the O
staff O
lounge O
sometimes. O
I O
wasn't O
used O
to O
a O
job O
that O
had O
me O
get O
up O
this O
early, O
let O
alone O
the O
sheer O
energy O
it O
takes. O
Year O
two O
was O
a O
lot O
better. O
Just O
give O
yourself O
room O
this O
year O
and O
try O
to O
set O
boundaries O
and O
not O
do O
extra O
work O
just O
to O
make O
a O
good O
impression. O

I B-Occupation
was I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
full-time I-Occupation
assistant I-Occupation
at I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
preschool I-Occupation
for B-Time
a I-Time
couple I-Time
years I-Time
before B-Occupation
my I-Occupation
first I-Occupation
year I-Occupation
teaching I-Occupation
elementary, I-Occupation
and O
I O
was O
still O
insanely O
exhausted O
and O
overwhelmed O
during O
my O
first O
year. O
I B-Education
started I-Education
my I-Education
masters I-Education
in B-Time
my I-Time
6th I-Time
year I-Time
and O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
dying O
all O
over O
again. O
If O
you O
can, O
take O
grad O
school O
a O
little O
slower. O
There’s O
no O
use O
in O
torturing O
yourself! O
[SEP]
Your O
first O
year O
is O
impossible. O
It O
is O
hell. O
I O
can’t O
imagine O
what O
it O
would O
be O
like O
with O
grad O
school O
on O
top O
of O
it. O
But O
it O
gets O
a O
lot O
easier O
once O
you O
build O
up O
your O
foundation O
of O
lessons O
and O
material O
(and O
once O
you O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
prioritize O
what O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
and O
what O
is O
optional). O
[SEP]
I O
can O
relate. O
I O
have O
a O
second O
job, O
required O
college O
classes O
to O
earn O
my O
license, O
a O
new O
baby, O
a O
special O
needs O
dog O
and O
my O
teenager O
is O
a O
pain O
in O
the O
ass. O
With O
that O
being O
said, O
your O
struggle O
is O
real. O
It’s O
not O
easy. O
As O
a O
teacher, O
you O
are O
mentally O
engaged O
for O
8 O
hours O
a O
day. O
Most O
workers O
have O
maybe O
4 O
hours O
of O
real O
mental O
engagement. O
Sleeping O
8-9 O
hours O
a O
night O
is O
a O
blessing O
though. O
From O
a O
compensation O
and O
inflation O
perspective, O
I O
suspect O
many O
of O
us O
are O
not O
eating O
well. O
Treat O
yourself O
to O
something O
nice, O
don’t O
be O
hard O
on O
yourself. O
You O
are O
winning, O
even O
though O
it’s O
hard! O
[SEP]
The O
first O
year O
is O
so O
hard. O
You’ve O
gotten O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
advice O
here. O
Please O
prioritize O
yourself—you O
are O
worth O
it O
and O
I O
find O
I’m O
a O
better O
teacher O
when O
I O
do. O
Thinking O
of O
you! O
[SEP]
I O
recommend O
Western O
Governors O
U O
for O
grad O
school. O
6 O
months, O
$3750 O
out O
the O
door. O
Accredited. O
[SEP]
I'm O
in O
my O
second O
year, O
and O
an O
attitude O
shift O
has O
done O
wonders O
for O
my O
mental O
health. O
Basically, O
just O
let O
go O
and O
accept O
the O
fact O
that O
you'll O
never O
feel O
"caught O
up." O
You O
will O
always O
have O
a O
huge O
backlog O
of O
things O
which O
need O
to O
get O
done, O
and O
that's O
okay. O
And O
if O
you're O
a O
perfectionist, O
you're O
gonna O
need O
to O
get O
over O
that, O
too. O
Part O
of O
that O
is O
learning O
to O
selectively O
tune O
out O
the O
nonstop O
drumbeat O
from O
grad O
school, O
admin, O
PDs, O
etc. O
that O
every O
single O
thing O
we O
do O
is O
ultra-important O
and O
every O
single O
lesson O
needs O
to O
be O
a O
Danielson O
masterpiece O
(or O
substitute O
in O
whatever O
rubric O
your O
district O
uses). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Oh, O
and O
sometimes O
it's O
perfectly O
fine O
to O
"wing O
it." O
Not O
every O
day, O
but O
if O
you O
ever O
go O
to O
bed O
at O
night O
thinking, O
"I O
know O
the O
material O
for O
tomorrow's O
lesson O
through O
and O
through, O
I O
know O
exactly O
what O
we're O
going O
to O
do O
and O
how O
we're O
going O
to O
do O
it," O
guess O
what? O
You're O
finished O
with O
your O
lesson O
plan! O
Congratulations! O
[SEP]
I O
personally O
love O
factor O
meals O
they O
are O
healthy O
and O
the O
food O
is O
ready O
in O
2 O
minutes. O
It’s O
90$ O
a O
week O
for O
6 O
meals O
and O
they O
have O
cheaper O
plans O
too. O
[SEP]
I’m O
not O
sure O
what O
grade O
or O
subject O
you O
teach, O
but O
something O
that O
saved O
me O
a O
ton O
of O
time O
and O
stress O
was O
making O
an O
agenda O
slide O
for O
each O
day O
in O
a O
running O
slide O
deck. O
If O
I O
couldn’t O
get O
around O
to O
lesson O
plans O
(eventually O
just O
stopped O
doing O
them) O
I O
would O
at O
the O
very O
least O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
agenda. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Build O
in O
classroom O
time O
that’s O
independent O
work O
for O
the O
kids. O
Like O
15 O
mins O
of O
independent O
reading O
per O
day, O
15 O
mins O
on O
an O
online O
math O
program, O
something O
self O
directed. O
That O
gives O
you O
some O
breathing O
room O
during O
each O
class/block O
to O
either O
chill O
or O
get O
stuff O
done. O
Sometimes O
I O
would O
pay O
my O
bills O
online O
while O
they O
were O
reading. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Remember O
not O
everything O
has O
to O
be O
graded. O
Don’t O
tell O
the O
kids O
that. O
But O
yeah O
a O
random O
worksheet O
or O
discussion O
post… O
trash O
it. O
[SEP]
I’m O
so O
sorry O
you O
are O
going O
through O
this. O
One O
idea O
that O
helped O
me O
was O
you O
don’t O
owe O
your O
life O
to O
any O
job. O
[SEP]
First O
year O
teacher O
here O
on O
an O
alt O
cert O
doing O
community O
college O
classes O
to O
get O
my O
full O
cert, O
and O
I O
feel O
you. O
You O
are O
not O
alone!! O
I O
also O
take O
no O
work O
home O
most O
days O
(except O
for O
essay O
grading... O
English O
is O
rough O
for O
grading) O
and O
can't O
muster O
up O
energy O
to O
do O
more O
than O
sit O
and O
watch O
TV. O
I O
fall O
asleep O
with O
the O
lights O
on O
in O
my O
work O
clothes. O
It O
is O
tough O
and O
I O
don't O
have O
any O
tips O
for O
you, O
just O
wanted O
you O
to O
know O
I'm O
right O
there O
with O
you. O
Some O
things O
are O
getting O
easier O
and O
I O
just O
try O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
small O
wins. O
We O
got O
this! O
Christmas O
break O
is O
coming!! O
Take O
care O
of O
yourself. O
I O
lost O
a O
ton O
of O
weight O
first O
quarter O
and O
worry O
about O
keeping O
myself O
fed O
and O
rested. O
Much O
love O
to O
you, O
friend. O
[SEP]
That’s O
showbiz O
baby O
[SEP]
you O
will O
feel O
better O
after O
exercise. O
you O
will O
gain O
some O
of O
your O
life O
back. O
even O
you O
feel O
tired, O
do O
it. O
[SEP]
Work O
only O
contract O
hours, O
take O
nothing O
home. O
Prioritize O
your O
tasks O
during O
your O
planning. O
Take O
a O
“sick” O
day O
if O
you O
need O
it. O
[SEP]
Things O
get O
easier O
as O
you O
learn O
curriculum, O
learn O
to O
run O
a O
classroom, O
etc. O
[SEP]
Go O
to O
a O
doctor O
and O
get O
a O
check O
up. O
I O
was O
really O
tired O
and O
had O
strep O
but O
didn’t O
know O
it. O
You’ll O
get O
your O
energy O
back O
eventually. O
Christmas O
is O
almost O
here. O
Maybe O
evaluate O
your O
house O
systems O
so O
that O
it O
is O
more O
manageable(I O
hate O
folding O
clothes, O
but O
if O
you O
put O
one O
item O
away O
every O
day, O
while O
your O
food O
is O
microwaving, O
it O
will O
be O
one O
less O
thing O
out). O
But O
even O
if O
you O
don’t, O
it’s O
almost O
Christmas. O
You O
can O
rest O
and O
play O
with O
your O
cat. O
[SEP]
First O
off, O
I’m O
so O
sorry; O
honestly, O
just O
like O
everyone O
has O
said, O
the O
first O
year O
is O
so O
hard. O
I O
definitely O
remember O
feeling O
everything O
you’re O
saying O
(especially O
in O
the O
time O
between O
thanksgiving O
and O
Christmas). O
There O
were O
a O
few O
things O
that O
really O
helped O
me O
my O
first O
year O
(and O
continue O
to O
help O
me O
when O
I O
have O
really O
rough O
weeks). O
First, O
I’ve O
always O
been O
a O
runner, O
and O
I O
really O
stopped O
running O
the O
first O
couple O
months O
of O
my O
first O
year. O
I O
started O
making O
myself O
go O
run O
for O
15 O
minutes O
(I O
live O
in O
the O
city O
and O
made O
my O
run O
part O
of O
my O
commute). O
Almost O
immediately, O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
got O
a O
little O
of O
myself O
back; O
it’s O
kind O
of O
wild O
what O
15 O
minutes O
of O
fresh O
air O
and O
exercise O
can O
do. O
I O
also O
got O
really O
into O
meal O
prepping O
on O
the O
weekends; O
I O
tried O
to O
incentivize O
it O
(watching O
shows/movies O
I O
was O
looking O
forward O
to), O
and O
it O
turned O
into O
something O
I O
really O
look O
forward O
to O
even O
years O
later. O
The O
last O
thing O
that O
I O
think O
practically O
made O
a O
big O
difference O
was O
scheduling O
things O
during O
the O
week O
that O
I O
knew O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
and O
then O
sticking O
with O
them. O
It O
can O
feel O
SO O
hard O
and O
isolating, O
but O
having O
something O
on O
a O
Tuesday O
evening O
that O
meant O
I O
literally O
couldn’t O
stay O
at O
work O
until O
6 O
made O
a O
huge O
difference O
for O
me. O
Hope O
some O
of O
that O
helps! O
Mostly, O
you’re O
doing O
great, O
you O
can O
do O
this, O
AND O
you O
don’t O
have O
to O
do O
this. O
Give O
yourself O
grace O
and O
know O
that O
if O
you O
want O
to O
keep O
doing O
this, O
it O
will O
get O
better! O
[SEP]
17 O
years O
in..It O
doesn’t O
change. O
[SEP]
It O
will O
get O
better. O
You O
will O
build O
up O
your O
resources O
and O
not O
have O
to O
spend O
as O
much O
time O
on O
that. O
You O
should O
figure O
out O
the O
best O
way O
for O
you O
to O
be O
as O
organized O
as O
possible O
and O
that O
will O
help. O
As O
you O
get O
more O
comfortable O
in O
lesson O
planning O
you’ll O
get O
time O
back. O
Hang O
in O
there O
it O
really O
is O
worth O
the O
stress. O

is O
something O
I O
look O
at O
every O

I O
think O
it O
describes O
nearly O
every O
years O
experience O
- O
at O
least O
as O
a O
middle O
school O
teacher. O
Hang O
in O
there O
and O
the O
advice O
from O
u/Southern-Magnolia12 O
is O
golden. O
[SEP]
Something O
that O
has O
helped O
me O
is O
to O
find O
things O
that O
help O
me O
mentally O
reset O
on O
the O
weekend. O
If O
I O
can O
feel O
like O
I O
used O
my O
weekend O
to O
do O
something O
I O
enjoyed, O
was O
restful, O
or O
fun, O
or O
worthwhile O
but O
most O
importantly O
for O
myself O
I O
can O
make O
it O
through O
Wednesday O
on O
that O
feeling. O
After O
that O
I O
hang O
in O
there O
until O
the O
weekend O
again. O
Also O
this O
is O
just O
me O
but O
relaxing O
games O
that O
I O
can O
spend O
hours O
in O
without O
thinking O
about O
anything O
else O
such O
as O
Stardew O
Valley O
or O
Pokemon O
really O
help O
with O
the O
burnout O
when O
I O
get O
home. O
That O
said, O
everything O
is O
still O
a O
mess O
at O
home O
and O
I'm O
still O
not O
eating O
well O
but O
at O
least O
I'm O
not O
miserable O
all O
the O
time. O
[SEP]
First O
year O
teaching O
is O
100% O
always O
the O
worst. O
Eventually, O
it O
DOES O
get O
better. O
Can't O
say O
much O
about O
the O
pay O
though... O
[SEP]
Currently O
a O
well O
seasoned O
teacher O
and O
completing O
grad O
school. O
Would O
highly O
advise O
not O
to O
study O
until O
you O
have O
a O
number O
of O
years O
under O
your O
belt. O
Studying O
is O
important O
but O
can O
you O
move O
it O
just O
a O
few O
years O
so O
you O
can O
settle O
yourself O
first. O
Otherwise O
you O
might O
end O
up O
hating O
a O
career. O
If O
that’s O
not O
possible O
you O
will O
hopefully O
take O
a O
hard O
look O
at O
all O
your O
needs O
and O
commitments O
and O
only O
select O
essentials O
so O
you O
can O
manage. O
It’s O
very O
very O
hard O
in O
your O
first O
year, O
most O
teachers O
will O
be O
able O
to O
sympathize O
with O
you. O
[SEP]
This O
sounds O
like O
burnout, O
you’ve O
been O
working O
yourself O
too O
hard. O
It’s O
very O
common O
in O
this O
profession, O
sadly. O
[SEP]
it O
gets O
better, O
promise. O
the O
2nd O
year O
will O
be O
reasonably O
better O
and O
the O
third O
year O
is O
like O
a O
weight O
is O
lifted O
off O
your O
shoulders. O
You're O
going O
through O
the O
worst O
part O
now… O
See O
it O
through O
and O
the O
pay O
off O
for O
years O
to O
come O
is O
totally O
worth O
it O
[SEP]
Oatmeal O

I O
am O

of O
getting O
masters. O
4th O
year O
teaching O
Art O
(first O
year O
was O
COVID O
year). O
It O
honestly O
does O
get O
better O
.. O
but O
it O
is O
still O
always O
going O
to O
be O
exhausting. O
What O
has O
helped O
me O
greatly O
is O
setting O
strict O
boundaries. O
I O
do O
not O
do O
work O
after O
I O
get O
out O
unless O
it’s O
some O
sort O
of O
urgent O
matter O
like O
grades O
being O
due. O
Use O
your O
time O
efficiently O
while O
at O
work O
and O
most O
importantly, O
let O
go O
of O
having O
everything O
be O
perfect. O
If O
it O
doesn’t O
get O
done, O
then O
it O
doesn’t O
get O
done. O
Oh O
well. O
Also O
for O
food O
I O
find O
that O
buying O
pre O
prepared/seasoned O
meats O
and O
pre O
chopped O
vegetables O
makes O
cooking O
easy. O
Just O
stick O
it O
in O
the O
air O
fryer. O
As O
for O
working O
out, O
aim O
for O
only O
2 O
days O
a O
week. O
As O
long O
as O
you O
are O
moving O
a O
lot O
at O
work O
(which O
I O
know O
we O
are O
a O
lot O
as O
teachers), O
and O
eating O
within O
your O
calorie O
range O
for O
the O
day, O
you O
will O
be O
more O
than O
fine. O
I O
know O
exactly O
how O
you O
feel. O
I O
still O
feel O
this O
way O
sometimes O
but O
then O
I O
just O
tell O
myself O
to O
stop O
caring O
as O
much O
and O
it O
helps O
tremendously. O

This O
was O
me O
last O

Master's O
program, O
25-mile O
commute O
through O
the O
worst O
traffic O
both O
ways, O
unsupportive O

and O
a O
bad O

It O
fucking O
sucks. O
It O
is O
hard O
and O
you O
are O
suffering O
through O
it. O
I O
totally O
empathize O
with O
your O
situation. O
All O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
is O
that O
this O
year O
is O
way O
easier. O
I O
did O
switch O
schools, O
25 O
miles O
went O
to O
less O
than O
3, O
but O
all O
the O
work O
I O
put O
into O
my O
curriculum O

we O

is O
just O
how O

is. O
I’m O
on O

I O
still O
come O
home O

go O
numb O
in O

of O
the O

until O
it’s O

to O
go O

It’s O
awful, O
it’s O
the O
profession O
[SEP]
We’ve O
all O
been O
there. O
For O
what O
it’s O
worth, O
I’m O
here O
for O
you. O
I O
could O
give O
you O
some O
well O
intentioned O
pat O
advice, O
but O
I O
have O
a O
better O
idea: O
This O
song O
was O
written O
almost O
36 O
years O
ago, O
but O
it O
was O
WRITTEN O
FOR O
YOU. O
it O
is O
the O
most O
inspirational O
song O
I O
have O
ever O
heard. O
And O
I O
was O
a O
music O
teacher! O
When O
I O
feel O
overwhelmed O
and O
emotionally O
drained O
I O
listen O
to O
this O
song O
sometimes O
three O
or O
four O
times O
in O
a O
row. O
I O
can’t O
promise O
that O
it O
will O
make O
you O
feel O
better, O
but O
I O
can O
guarantee O
you O
it O
will O
not O
make O
you O
feel O
worse. O
It O
always O
works O
for O
me. O

I O
really O
hope O
I O
can O

you. O
I O
know O
exactly O
how O
if O
you O
feel. O
[SEP]
Have O
you O
tried O
scheduling O
more O
independent O
work O
for O
the O
kids? O
For O
example, O
they O
can O
grade O
their O
own O
work. O
Take O
that O
time O
to O
just O
breathe O
or O
catch O
up O
on O
planning. O
Also, O
I’ve O
found O
that O
not O
raising O
your O
voice O
or O
addressing O
every O
little O
issue O
has O
done O
wonders O
to O
my O
energy O
levels. O
If O
they’re O
not O
following O
classroom O
expectations, O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
time O
you O
can O
just O
wait. O
They’ll O
correct O
themselves O

Hi, O
3rd O
year O
teacher O
here! O
I O
saw O
your O
comment O
that O
you O
don't O
take O
work O
home O
and O
leave O
at O
contract O
time. O
GOOD. O
That's O
the O
most O
important O
first O
step. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
two O
things O
that O
saved O
me O
my O
first O
year O
was O
taking O
a O
30 O
minute O
cat O
nap O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
home, O
and O
meal O
prepping O
Saturday-Monday. O
I O
only O
cooked O
dinner O
Saturday-Monday O
nights O
but O
I O
make O
enough O
food O
for O
2-3 O
meals. O
This O
way O
I O
had O
healthy O
and O
yummy O
food O
during O
the O
week, O
but O
didn't O
have O
to O
cook O
every O
night! O
The O
nap O
helped O
me O
just O
survive. O
I O
gained O
a O
little O
extra O
energy O
to O
get O
me O
through O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
until O
bed, O
and O
if O
I O
didn't O
nap O
I O
simply O
could O
not O
be O
productive. O
After O
nap, O
I'd O
have O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
or O
half O
caf O
coffee O
and O
get O
on O
with O
my O
evening! O
[SEP]
To O
be O
fair O
with O
how O
terrible O
education O
has O
been O
in O
the O
last O
decade O
only O
those O
that O
are O
gullible O
enough O
are O
left O
teaching. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Welcome O
to O
the O
gullibility O
group. O
[SEP]
I O
got O
some O
ideas/hypotheses O
that O
I O
think O
apply O
to O
two O
root O
factors O
of O
your O
problem O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**Conclusions** O
[SEP]
[SEP]
One O
conclusion O
strongly O
guides O
thinking, O
planning O
and O
decisions. O
For O
example, O
if O
one O
concludes O
"I O
hate O
broccoli", O
he/she O
will O
reject O
broccoli O
and O
any O
food O
make O
with O
it. O
It O
the O
hated O
thing O
is O
a O
person, O
he/she O
will O
not O
want O
to O
interact O
with O
or O
maybe O
even O
stay O
near O
the O
person. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So, O
when O
you O
conclude O
"I O
am O
exhausted", O
this O
has O
an O
effect O
in O
your O
thinking, O
planning O
and O
decisions. O
The O
point O
is: O
is O
it O
fully O
true? O
Consider O
a O
scenario O
that O
you're O
feeling O
extremely O
exhausted O
and O
your O
house O
catches O
fire; O
you O
will O
certainly O
have O
energy O
to O
do O
something. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
simplest O
way O
I O
know O
to O
question O
such O
conclusions O
is O
to O
make O
a O
question O
out O
of O
it: O
"Do O
I O
hate O
broccoli?", O
"Am O
I O
exhausted?" O
Some O
emphasis O
may O
help: O
"Am O
I O
*really, O
completely* O
exhausted??". O
This O
opens O
the O
conclusion O
and O
makes O
it O
easier O
or O
less O
difficult O
to O
do O
something. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
**Connections** O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
best O
days O
I O
use O
to O
have O
at O
work O
is O
when O
I O
*complete* O
tasks. O
When O
something O
remains O
pendent O
and O
I O
"take O
it O
home", O
that's O
when O
I O
get O
more O
tired. O
The O
days O
with O
several O
pendencies O
are O
the O
worst. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
have O
*connections* O
to O
things, O
persons, O
problems, O
tasks. O
A O
connection O
is O
associated O
with O
some O
*feeling*. O
When O
we O
complete O
something, O
we O
can O
disconnect O
from O
it; O
we O
don't O
feel O
it O
anymore. O
To O
"take O
a O
task O
home" O
means O
that O
we O
keep O
the O
connection O
with O
the O
task O
active. O
In O
the O
ideal O
scenario, O
we O
keep O
a O
connection O
active O
only O
when O
we O
dedicate O
to O
it; O
an O
active O
connection O
with O
something O
else O
is O
a O
distraction, O
an O
interference. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
that O
you O
are O
"taking O
the O
problems O
home"; O
technically, O
you O
keep O
active O
whatever O
you O
felt O
something O
about. O
In O
other O
words, O
and O
as O
you O
have O
undesirable O
feelings O
about O
your O
experiences, O
you O
keep O
feeding O
the O
connections O
and O
this O
becomes O
a O
cycle. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So, O
what O
to O
do? O
To O
fight O
such O
connections O
is O
a O
lost O
battle, O
they O
are O
reinforced O
by O
the O
attention O
they O
receive. O
Tire O
the O
body O
works O
for O
me, O
but O
sometimes O
a O
get O
into O
a O
state O
similar O
to O
yours O
and O
have O
to O
find O
another O
option. O
The O
simplest O
and O
best O
solution O
to O
me O
is O
to O
connect O
to O
another O
thing, O
for O
example O
some O
activity O
that O
you O
love O
do O
do. O
In O
fact, O
anything O
that O
deviates O
your O
attention O
from O
the O
problem O
will O
work; O
so, O
simply O
*start O
the O
search O
for O
a O
solution* O
is O
a O
step O
in O
the O
right O
direction. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Hope O
this O
helps, O
I'd O
appreciate O
honest O
and O
pitiless O
feedback. O

[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
first O
year O
of O
teaching O
AND O
grad O
work O
is O
beyond O
exhausting. O
The O
bit O
about O
not O
going O
to O
the O
gym O
was O
esp. O
relatable. O
By O
the O
end O
of O
that O
first O
year O
I O
looked O
like O
a O
skeleton. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Remember O
the O
minimum O
passing O
grade O
for O
your O
classes O
and O
work O
to O
be O
a O
svelt O
but O
safe O
margin O
above O
that. O
You O
are O
learning O
so O
much, O
and O
practicing O
so O
many O
skills, O
that O
it O
is O
almost O
impossible O
for O
you O
to O
be O
a O
"""""good O
teacher""""" O
and O
meet O
ALL O
the O
expectations O
put O
on O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
stick O
with O
it O
and O
survive O
the O
year, O
all O
this O
will O
be O
a O
laughable O
memory O
when O
you O
get O
to O
your O
second O
year. O
Because O
then O
you're O
able O
to O
implement O
all O
the O
classroom O
strategies O
you've O
been O
working O
on, O
ON O
DAY O
1, O
BABY!! O
That's O
the O
good O
shit! O
It O
makes O
a O
world O
of O
difference, O
and O
I'm O
stoked O
for O
you O
to O
experience O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
cannot O
describe O
how O
much O
better O
your O
second O
year O
of O
teaching O
will O
be. O
So O
long O
as O
you O
focus O
on O
this O
year O
being O
your O
chance O
to O
learn, O
practice, O
and O
make O
mistakes! O
& O
don't O
you O
fucking O
LOOK O
at O
that O
work O
email O
before O
or O
after O
work O
hours, O
so O
help O
me O
Dewey. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
a O
first O
year O
and O
I O
am O
taking O
one O
tomorrow. O
I O
need O
it. O
You O
need O
it O
[SEP]
I O
was O
going O
to O
say O
the O
same O
thing; O
it's O
a O
mental O
health O
day O
to O
safeguard O
your O
mind. O
I O
take O
them O
as O
needed O
using O
my O
days. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
working O
to O
contract O
is O
the O
best O
advice O
in O
a O
teachers O
first O
year. O
In O
general, O
it O
takes O
a O
while O
to O
hit O
the O
learning O
curve O
and O
sometimes O
overwork O
is O
just O
part O
of O
the O
deal O
early O
on. O
Having O
said O
that, O
you O
need O
to O
take O
care O
of O
yourself. O
Stress O
and O
the O
accompanying O
depression/anxiety O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
cannot O
be O
slept O
off O
like O
a O
flu. O
You O
just O
have O
to O
move. O
Walk O
around O
the O
block O
a O
few O
times. O
But O
don’t O
just O
give O
in O
to O
gravity. O
Gravity O
is O
not O
your O
friend. O
Even O
moderate O
exercise O
is O
better O
than O
any O
medication. O
And O
I O
oughta O
know. O
[SEP]
On O
the O
subject O
of O
mental O
health O
days: O
it O
sometimes O
helps O
to O
get O
signed O
off O

intermittent O
FMLA. O
You O
will O
wanna O
reach O
out O
to O
your O
Primary O
Care O
Provider O
or O
a O
therapist O
to O
help O
with O
this O
documentation. O
It O

you O
are O

4th I-Occupation

The O
only O
thing O
extra O
I O
have O
take O

tutoring O
once O
a O

I O
need O
the O
pay. O
[SEP]
Great O
advice! O
And O
yes, O
you O
can O
do O
anything O
for O
one O
year. O
And O
after O
finishing O
years O
1-2 O

you O
can O
pretty O
much O
do O
anything. O
[SEP]
second O
this. O
[SEP]
Sure O

in O

[SEP]
Unfortunately, O
I O
need O
the O

raise O
that O
comes O
with O
a O

soon O
as O
possible. O

This O

a O

[SEP]
I O

Second O
this! O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O

So O
true O
about O
not O
grading O
everything!!! O
Even O
now, O
I’ll O
look O
at O
a O
pile O
of O
students’ O
papers, O
and O
fulfill O
the O
urge O
to O
just O
recycle O
them. O
I O
feel O
bad O
for O
about O
1 O
minute O
until O
I O
realize: O
nobody O
cares!! O
[SEP]
I O
really O
love O
this. O
All O
of O
this. O
[SEP]
I O
agree O
with O
Snoo’s O
advice. O
Life O
is O
too O
short O
[SEP]
Three O
colds O
and O
COVID O
so O
far O
this O
school O
year O
working O
as O
a O
full-time O
substitute O
in O
elementary O
school. O
Despite O
being O
vaccinated O
and O
boosted! O
Lots O
of O
teachers O
out O
today O
due O
to O
flu. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
have O
to O
do O
the O
real O
work O
of O
a O
teacher O
like O
grading O
papers, O
lesson O
prep, O
parent O
conferences, O
etc. O
but O
I O
still O
come O
home O
wiped O
out O
and O
am O
asleep O
by O
9 O
if O
not O
8 O
at O
night. O
[SEP]
Sweet! O
You O
must O
live O
in O
an O
area O
with O
a O
good O
union O
[SEP]
You’re O
* O
[SEP]
Thanks. O
I O
keep O
waiting O
for O
that O
stamina O
to O
kick O
in O
but O
I’m O
now O
learning O
it’s O
a O
much O
more O
long O
term O
thing! O
[SEP]
I'm O
working O
towards O
fulfilling O
my O
state's O
requirements O
to O
get O
an O
alt O
cert O
to O
teach O
HS O
English. O
I'm O
studying O
for O
the O
ELA O
Educators O
Assessment O
exam O
now, O
I'm O
also O
subbing O
currently O
and O
I'm O
always O
getting O
sick O
so O
I O
keep O
pushing O
the O
exam O
date O
back O
so O
I O
have O
plenty O
of O
studying O
time. O
Anyway, O
I O
hope O
to O
be O
in O
your O
shoes O
next O
year. O
Are O
you O
glad O
you O
chose O
this O
path, O
exhaustion O
notwithstanding? O
Are O
your O
fellow O
teachers O
supportive? O
Do O
you O
feel O
like O
your O
classroom O
management O
is O
getting O
better? O
I O
hope O
you O
don't O
mind O
my O
inquisition, O
it's O
just O
nice O
to O
see O
others O
others O
in O
Reddit O
land O
already O
doing O
what O
I O
hope O
to O
be O
doing O
soon O
myself. O
Thanks! O

Agreed. O
It's O
sounds O
counter-intuitive O
but O
when O
I O
exercise O
I O
have O
much O
more O
energy O
during O
the O
day O
than O
when O
I O
don't. O
Maybe O
OP O
could O
try O
10-15 O
min O
of O
yoga O
which O
will O
also O
help O
with O
the O
stress? O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
this. O
I O
decided O
I’m O
taking O
a O
personal O
day O
next O
week. O
It’s O
confusing O
because O
I O
do O
not O
take O
work O
home, O
even O
though O
it O
sounds O
like O
I O
do. O
I O
leave O
at O
contract O
time O
every O
day. O
I O
think O
I O
am O
mentally O
taking O
stuff O
home O
and O
that’s O
the O
thing O
I O
don’t O
know O
how O
to O
stop O
[SEP]
I O
totally O
get O
what O
you’re O
saying. O
And O
I’ve O
thought O
about O
it O
a O
lot. O
But O
what O
makes O
a O
first O
year O
teacher O
different O
from O
any O
other O
teacher? O
How O
many O
first O
year O
teachers O
suffer O
so O
badly O
that O
they O
quit? O
If O
teacher O
programs O
aren’t O
preparing O
teachers O
to O
teach, O
something O
has O
to O
change. O
It O
shouldn’t O
just O
have O
to O
be, O
welp O
everyone O
had O
a O
really O
shitty O
first O
year, O
good O
luck O
and O
do O
your O
best. O
What O
would O
it O
look O
like O
if O
first O
year O
teachers O
worked O
to O
contract O
like O
anyone O
else? O
My O
teacher O
mentor O
when O
I O
was O
in O
grad O
school, O
stayed O
after O
school O
until O
at O
least O
6pm O
every O
day. O
I O
had O
a O
principal O
who O
said O
teachers O
should O
stay O
until O
the O
work O
is O
finished. O
This O
mentality O
needs O
to O
change. O
My O
argument O
is O
that O
teachers O
would O
learn O
time O
management O
even O
sooner O
and O
they O
letting O
go O
of O
things O
is O
ok O
if O
they O
left O
on O
time. O
[SEP]
Yea O
or O
if O
you O
want O
a O
livable O
wage O
[SEP]
It O
is O
not O
a O
TFA O
requirement. O
Perhaps O
some O
states O
require O
it. O
[SEP]
For O
those O
who O
downvoted O
me, O
I O
can’t O
leave O
a O
your/ O
you’re O
mistake O
because O
I O
just O
claimed O
to O
be O
a O
teacher. O
That’s O
a O
baaaad O
mistake O
to O
make O
for O
a O
teacher, O
In O
my O
honest O
opinion. O
Right O
up O
there O
with O
not O
knowing O
how O
to O
use O
they’re, O
their, O
and O
there; O
or O
to, O
too, O
and O
two. O
I O
figure O
if O
I’m O
responsible O
for O
educating O
the O
next O
generation, O
I’d O
better O
hold O
myself O
to O
the O
appropriate O
standard O
I’d O
hold O
them O
to. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
thankful O
every O
day. O
I O
have O
only O
known O
food O
service O
and O
hospitality O
for O
my O
adult O
life. O
I O
used O
to O
sit O
there O
at O
various O
restaurants, O
coffee O
shops, O
hotels, O
etc O
staring O
out O
the O
window O
for O
hours O
on O
slow O
days O
miserable O
out O
of O
my O
mind, O
dreaming O
of O
being O
anywhere O
else. O
I O
would O
do O
it O
all O
again. O
I O
have O
gotten O
better O
at O
many O
things, O
and O
other O
things O
are O
a O
work O
in O
progress. O
My O
biggest O
advice O
is O
be O
a O
fair, O
kind, O
funny O
hardass O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
can O
in O
the O
year. O
Drink O
water. O
Eat O
well. O
Don't O
take O
things O
personally. O
Know O
that O
you O
will O
lose O
sleep, O
lose O
weight, O
and O
feel O
overwhelmed, O
and O
be O
prepared O
for O
that. O
My O
administration O
and O
colleagues O
are O
supportive O
enough O
and O
my O
coach O
is O
AMAZING O
but O
doesn't O
know O
my O
content O
area. O
Lesson O
planning O
and O
grading O
are O
huge O
learning O
curves O
but O
admin O
will O
look O
more O
at O
classroom O
management O
in O
my O
experience. O
Drink O
whatever O
Kool O
aid O
your O
school O
is O
pushing, O
for O
us O
it's O
PBIS O
and O
relevancy O
statements, O
but O
be O
realistic O
about O
your O
abilities. O
And O
above O
all O
remember O
that O
you O
have O
to O
teach O
the O
kids O
you O
have. O
No O
amount O
of O
complaining O
will O
transform O
your O
students O
into O
what O
you O
expect O
of O
them. O
They O
are O
who O
they O
are. O
You O
can't O
teach O
students O
who O
aren't O
there--so O
don't O
try. O
Best O
of O
luck O
to O
you O
<3 O
[SEP]
Just O
because O
you O
aren't O
at O
work O
or O
doing O
work O
tasks O
doesn't O
mean O
that O
your O
body O
is O
at O
rest. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Make O
a O
list O
of O
things O
that O
make O
you O
feel O
truly O
rejuvenated O
and O
require O
little O
energy O
and O
try O
to O
do O
at O
least O
one O
or O
two O
of O
those O
things O
each O
night. O
Then, O
on O
your O
days O
off, O
seriously O
dive O
into O
those O
fulfilling O
passions. O
It O
can O
be O
easy O
to O
fall O
into O
a O
spiral O
of O
low-input O
dopamine O
seeking O
tasks O
(like O
reddit O
lmao) O
but O
those O
rarely O
allow O
our O
minds O
rest O
and O
rejuvenation. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Another O
thing O
that O
took O
time O
for O
me O
to O
master: O
Feel O
justified O
in O
saying O
no O
to O
as O
many O
invitations/obligations O
as O
you O
need O
to O
in O
order O
to O
thrive O
mentally/emotionally. O
This O
is O
a O
marathon, O
not O
a O
sprint. O

Meditation O
and O
yoga O
helped O
tremendously. O
I O
never O
was O
too O
rigorous, O
but O
it O
focused O
me O
to O
be O
present O
in O
the O
moment, O
which O
helped O
me O
recognize O
the O
work O
stuff O
I O
was O
bringing O
home. O
[SEP]
I O
did O
a O
post O
on O
another O
sub O
about O
“educational O
martyrs“. O
Many O
teachers O
had O
something O
to O
say O
about O
this. O
I O
got O
close O
to O
1000 O
comments, O
most O
like O
me, O
had O
very O
little O
patience O
for O
the O
type O
of O
teacher O
who O
puts O
in O
12 O
hours O
a O
day O
without O
any O
compensation. O
The O
pay O
they O
get O
is O
the O
right O
to O
humble O
brag. O
It’s O
not O
just O
that O
they O
work O
hard O
and O
long O
hours. O
It’s O
they O
work O
harder O
and O
longer O
than O
YOU O
do. O
And O
of O
course, O
they O
have O
to O
let O
you O
know O
or O
else O
all O
that O
work O
they O
did O
was O
in O
vain. O
Because O
I O
don’t O
believe O
for O
a O
minute O
that O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
for O
all O
“the O
kids“. O
We’re O
all O
fucking O
doing O
it O
for O
the O
kids! O
These O
people O
undermined O
their O
peers O
at O
contract O
negotiations. O
The O
administration O
puts O
them O
on O
a O
pedestal O
wrap O
some O
shiny O
wrapping O
paper O
and O
put O
some O
ribbon O
on O
therefore O
head. O
See! O
If O
these O
people O
can O
work O
all O
these O
extra O
hours O
without O
pay O
that O
you O
should O
be O
able O
to O
do O
it O
too. O
Aren’t O
you O
in O
it O
for O
the O
kids? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Having O
said O
all O
that, O
we O
need O
to O
be O
supportive O
of O
this O
particular O
teacher O
who O
is O
reaching O
out O
for O
help. O
Now. O
She O
can’t O
wait O
for O
this O
flawed O
model O
of O
teacher O
preparation O
to O
be O
rearranged. O
[SEP]
TFA O
pushes O
and O
highly O
encourages O
the O
masters O
though. O
[SEP]
Go O
away. O

AITA O
for O
uninviting O
my O
newly O
homophobic O
friend O
from O
my O
wedding? O
[SEP]
I O
(25f) B-Age_Gender
am B-Relationship_Status
getting I-Relationship_Status
married I-Relationship_Status
to I-Relationship_Status
my I-Relationship_Status
fiance I-Relationship_Status
next B-Time
month. I-Time
The O
wedding O
planning O
has O
been O
a O
smooth O
process O
and O
we've O
had O
no O
issues O
until O
late O
last O
week. O
I O
invited O
a O
friend O
(N) O
from O
school, O
we've O
been O
friends O
for O
12 O
years O
and O
have O
drifted O
apart O
due O
to O
life. O
She O
has O
always O
been O
quiet O
and O
not O
one O
to O
open O
up O
much, O
but O
Ive O
witnessed O
her O
unwavering O
support O
for O
the O
lgbtq+ O
community O
numerous O
times. O
N O
got O
into O
a O
relationship O
about O
4 O
years O
ago O
and O
had O
a O
baby O
with O
the O
man O
(L) O
last O
year. O
I O
met O
L O
at O
her O
baby O
shower O
and O
he O
seemed O
decent O
until O
I O
noticed O
some O
things, O
such O
as O
complaining O
that O
his O
son O
will O
not O
be O
using O
a O
pink O
colored O
teething O
ring O
and O
that O
the O
gender O
neutral O
clothing O
looked O
too O
'girly', O
and O
that O
he O
answered O
quite O
a O
few O
questions O
for O
N, O
stared O
her O
down O
and O
would O
white O
knuckle O
her O
knee O
every O
time O
she O
tried O
to O
give O
a O
different O
answer. O
I O
wholeheartedly O
believe O
she O
is O
being O
abused, O
because O
she O
is O
so O
quiet O
and O
doesnt O
stand O
up O
for O
herself. O

The O
main O
issue O
is O
that O
my O
gay O
sister O
and O
a O
few O
of O
my O
gay/bisexual O
cousins O
and O
friends O
are O
in O
my O
wedding O
party, O
and O
L O
does O
not O
like O
that. O
They O
(mostly O
L) O
called O
me O
last O
week O
to O
let O
me O
know O
how O
disrespectful O
it O
was O
to O
god O
that O
Ive O
allowed O
"the O
homos O
to O
infiltrate O
a O
sacred O
god O
ordained O
union". O
I O
laughed O
and O
hung O
up. O
N O
called O
me O
some O
hours O
later O
when O
she O
was O
alone O
and O
apologized O
for O
L's O
behavior, O
but O
told O
me O
she O
cant O
do O
anything O
about O
that. O
I O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
truly O
felt O
the O
way O
about O
my O
wedding O
that O
L O
claimed O
she O
did, O
and O
she O
sat O
quiet O
for O
about O
a O
minute O
before O
she O
laughed O
a O
bit O
and O
let O
an O
I O
dont O
know O
slip O
out O
of O
her O
mouth. O
I O
let O
her O
know O
that O
because O
of O
recent O
events O
regarding O
the O
lgbtq O
community O
here O
in O
Colorado O
I O
will O
be O
protecting O
my O
family O
and O
friends O
by O
not O
taking O
any O
chances, O
and O
therefore O
she O
and O
L O
are O
uninvited O
from O
my O
wedding. O
If O
anyone O
is O
wondering O
how O
they O
found O
out O
about O
my O
family O
being O
lgbtq+, O
me O
and O
fiance O
started O
a O
large O
group O
chat O
of O
friends/family O
to O
get O
to O
know O
eachother, O
and O
a O
few O
relatives O
have O
shocked O
me O
by O
their O
vitriolic O
contempt O
for O
the O
lgbt O
community, O
so O
they O
have O
been O
uninvited O
as O
well O
for O
safety, O
and O
fiance O
agrees. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
few O
mutual O
friends O
are O
calling O
me O
an O
asshole O
and O
unreasonable O
for O
what O
Ive O
done, O
because O
we've O
all O
seen O
N's O
support O
for O
the O
community O
firsthand, O
and O
we've O
all O
seen O
the O
manipulative O
behavior O
from O
L O
and O
know O
she O
is O
possibly O
being O
abused. O
Unfortunately O
I O
dont O
feel O
I O
can O
do O
anything O
further O
and O
Im O
going O
to O
do O
what O
I O
feel O
is O
right O
to O
protect O
my O
family. O

As O

Quite O
frankly O

you O

with. O

if O
you O
don't O

I O
(25f) B-Age_Gender
am O
getting O
married O
to O
my O
fiance O
next O
month. O
The O
wedding O
planning O
has O
been O
a O
smooth O
process O
and O
we've O
had O
no O
issues O
until O
late O
last O
week. O
I O
invited O
a O
friend O
(N) O
from O
school, O
we've O
been O
friends O
for O
12 O
years O
and O
have O
drifted O
apart O
due O
to O
life. O
She O
has O
always O
been O
quiet O
and O
not O
one O
to O
open O
up O
much, O
but O
Ive O
witnessed O
her O
unwavering O
support O
for O
the O
lgbtq+ O
community O
numerous O
times. O
N O
got O
into O
a O
relationship O
about O
4 O
years O
ago O
and O
had O
a O
baby O
with O
the O
man O
(L) O
last O
year. O
I O
met O
L O
at O
her O
baby O
shower O
and O
he O
seemed O
decent O
until O
I O
noticed O
some O
things, O
such O
as O
complaining O
that O
his O
son O
will O
not O
be O
using O
a O
pink O
colored O
teething O
ring O
and O
that O
the O
gender O
neutral O
clothing O
looked O
too O
'girly', O
and O
that O
he O
answered O
quite O
a O
few O
questions O
for O
N, O
stared O
her O
down O
and O
would O
white O
knuckle O
her O
knee O
every O
time O
she O
tried O
to O
give O
a O
different O
answer. O
I O
wholeheartedly O
believe O
she O
is O
being O
abused, O
because O
she O
is O
so O
quiet O
and O
doesnt O
stand O
up O
for O
herself. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
main O
issue O
is O
that O
my O
gay O
sister O
and O
a O
few O
of O
my O
gay/bisexual O
cousins O
and O
friends O
are O
in O
my O
wedding O
party, O
and O
L O
does O
not O
like O
that. O
They O
(mostly O
L) O
called O
me O
last O
week O
to O
let O
me O
know O
how O
disrespectful O
it O
was O
to O
god O
that O
Ive O
allowed O
"the O
homos O
to O
infiltrate O
a O
sacred O
god O
ordained O
union". O
I O
laughed O
and O
hung O
up. O
N O
called O
me O
some O
hours O
later O
when O
she O
was O
alone O
and O
apologized O
for O
L's O
behavior, O
but O
told O
me O
she O
cant O
do O
anything O
about O
that. O
I O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
truly O
felt O
the O
way O
about O
my O
wedding O
that O
L O
claimed O
she O
did, O
and O
she O
sat O
quiet O
for O
about O
a O
minute O
before O
she O
laughed O
a O
bit O
and O
let O
an O
I O
dont O
know O
slip O
out O
of O
her O
mouth. O
I O
let O
her O
know O
that O
because O
of O
recent O
events O
regarding O
the O
lgbtq O
community O
here O
in O
Colorado O
I O
will O
be O
protecting O
my O
family O
and O
friends O
by O
not O
taking O
any O
chances, O
and O
therefore O
she O
and O
L O
are O
uninvited O
from O
my O
wedding. O
If O
anyone O
is O
wondering O
how O
they O
found O
out O
about O
my O
family O
being O
lgbtq+, O
me O
and O
fiance O
started O
a O
large O
group O
chat O
of O
friends/family O
to O
get O
to O
know O
eachother, O
and O
a O
few O
relatives O
have O
shocked O
me O
by O
their O
vitriolic O
contempt O
for O
the O
lgbt O
community, O
so O
they O
have O
been O
uninvited O
as O
well O
for O
safety, O
and O
fiance O
agrees. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
few O
mutual O
friends O
are O
calling O
me O
an O
asshole O
and O
unreasonable O
for O
what O
Ive O
done, O
because O
we've O
all O
seen O
N's O
support O
for O
the O
community O
firsthand, O
and O
we've O
all O
seen O
the O
manipulative O
behavior O
from O
L O
and O
know O
she O
is O
possibly O
being O
abused. O
Unfortunately O
I O
dont O
feel O
I O
can O
do O
anything O
further O
and O
Im O
going O
to O
do O
what O
I O
feel O
is O
right O
to O
protect O
my O
family. O

You O
might O
want O

a O

anything O

you O
saw O

you O

does. O
If O

youre O
TA O
again O

just O
inviting O

YTA O
not O
for O
uninviting O

You O
say O
you O

been O

12 O

you O
cut O
her O
off O

physical O

[SEP]
So, O
you O
truly O
believe O
that O
inviting O
someone O
who O
is O
anti-gay O
to O
your O
wedding O
would O
create O
a O
safety O
issue O
for O
others? O
Are O
you O
worried O
for O
their O
actual O
physical O
safety, O
which O
seems O
a O
bit O
far-fetched, O
or O
are O
you O
worried O
that O
this O
guy O
might O
say O
something O
to O
hurt O
someone's O
feelings? O
Depending O
on O
how O
much O
you O
value O
your O
friendship O
with O
N, O
you O
need O
to O
carefully O
evaluate O
whether O
you O
have O
a O
legitimate O
safety O
concern O
or O
are O
you O
just O
virtue O
signaling O
on O
behalf O
of O
your O
gay O
friends/family? O
Also O
consider O
how O
important O
it O
is O
(or O
isn't) O
to O
your O
friend O
to O
attend. O
You O
say O
you've O
drifted O
apart; O
maybe O
she O
really O
doesn't O
care O
about O
attending O
your O
wedding O
and O
viewed O
your O
invitation O
as O
a O
solicitation O
for O
a O
wedding O
present... O
(The O
whole O
thing O
about O
her O
narcissistic O
husband O
is O
a O
wholly O
separate O
issue. O
But, O
would O
you O
disinvite O
your O
friend O
if O
her O
husband O
were O
just O
a O
controlling O
narcissist O
without O
the O
anti-gay O
baggage? O
) O
Just O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
to O
consider. O
[SEP]
I O
came O
to O
say O
this!!!!! O
NTA. O
The O
climate O
is O
crazy O
right O
now O
and O
you O
can't O
chance O
an O
abuser O
doing O
something O
crazy. O
[SEP]
N O
may O
have O
done O
a O
"lot" O
in O
the O
past O
for O
the O
community, O
but O
she's O
absolutely O
showing O
that O
her O
support O
is O
conditional O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
her O
own O
personal O
comfort. O
And, O
guess O
what, O
that's O
absolutely O
not O
good O
enough, O
especially O
right O
now, O
to O
guarantee O
the O
well-being O
and O
safety O
of O
anyone O
LGBT O
at O
the O
wedding. O
If O
she's O
being O
abused, O
the O
safest O
course O
of O
action O
would O
not O
be O
centered O
around O
inviting O
N O
to O
the O
wedding O
and/or O
keeping O
her O
involved O
with O
the O
event, O
but O
for O
OP O

say O
that O
she O
would O
support O
N O
if O

when O
she O
needs O
help O
leaving. O
[SEP]
This. O
Help O
your O

get O
out O
of O
there O

can, O

keep O
yourself O

your O
loved O

safe. O
NTA O

All O
of O
this, O

id O
also O
extend O
an O
olive O
branch O
to O
the O
friend O
to O
let O
her O
know O
op O
will O
help O
her O
if O
she O
needs O
to O
leave, O
that O
is O
textbook O
signs O
of O
abuse O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
he's O
so O
blatant O
about O
it O
in O

people O
means O
it O
is O
escalating O
[SEP]
THIS! O
SO O
SO O
SO O
MUCH O
THIS! O

exactly, O

expect O

continue O

killed O

maimed O

their O
delicate O
heterosexual O
sensibilities O
pero O
I'm O
not O
taking O
any O
chances! O
It O
really O
sucks O
that O
your O
friend O
is O
being O
abused O
but O
it's O
up O
to O
the O
abused O
person O
to O
ask O
for O
help. O
right O
now O
she's O
just O
helping O
him O
be O
a O
homophobe O
and O
spread O
hateful O
rhetoric, O
enabling O
him O
by O
saying O
it's O
okay O
and O
continuing O
to O
not O
only O
date O
said O
homophobe O
but O
saying O
"I O
don't O
know" O
to O
whether O
or O
not O
she O
agrees O
with O
him. O
I O
would O
tell O
her O
"I O
don't O
know" O
if O
I O
can O
be O
friends O
with O
such O
a O
violent O
homophobe O

This O
should O
be O
so O
much O
higher O
up. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
OP O
can O
do O
both O
by O
telling O
N O
that O
you O
love O
her O
and O
you’re O
here O
if O
she O
needs O
you. O
But O
that O
you O
can’t O
have O
her, O
or O
anyone O
who O
can’t O
provide O
wholehearted O
support O
to O
the O
LGBTQ O
community O
at O
your O
wedding O
[SEP]
Yes! O
The O
absolute O
best O
thing O
OP O
can O
do O
right O
now O
is O
leave O
the O
door O
open O
to O
her O
if O
or O
when O
she O
needs O
it, O
but O
not O
to O
put O
the O
people O
at O
the O
wedding O
in O
danger. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
lot O
of O
people O
stay O
in O
abusive O
relationships O
because O
they O
feel O
isolated O
and O
trapped. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Do O
what O
you O
need O
to O
do O
now O
to O
keep O
people O
safe, O
but O
also O
keep O
one O
foot O
in O
the O
door O
incase O
she O
also O
needs O
a O
safe O
place O
in O
the O
future. O
[SEP]
Well O
said! O
[SEP]
I O
believe O
OP O
used O
L O
for O
the O
male O
partner; O
her O
friend O
is O
N. O
[SEP]
Hopefully O
they O
can O
find O
someway O
to O
support O
N O
and O
talk O
with O
her O
about O
the O
abuse O
she O
is O
having O
done O
to O
her. O
Let O
her O
knowvwhat O
options O
she O
has O
if O
she O
needs O
to O
escape, O
who O
to O
call O
and O
where O
she O
can O
stay. O
[SEP]
Yes, O
N O
is O
showing O
signs O
she's O
coping O
with O
the O
abuse O
by O
identifying O
with O
her O
perpetrator. O
Tragic, O
but O
not O
OP's O
responsibility. O
[SEP]
I O
came O
here O
to O
say O
exactly O
that! O
What O
is O
to O
gain O
by O
inviting O
her O
to O
the O
wedding? O
She O
most O
likely O
would O
be O
uneasy O
about O
her O
SO O
doing O
something O
stupid O
and O
not O
fully O
enjoy O
the O
wedding O
anyway. O
[SEP]
How O
is O
it O
jot O
helping? O
Not O
having O
a O
person O
like O
L O
at O
the O
wedding O
is O
100% O
the O
right O
thing. O
Also O
I O
guarantee O
that O
N O
will O
not O
be O
sloud O
to O
attend O
without O
L. O
[SEP]
This O
doesn't O
seem O
like O
rose O
colored O
glasses, O
N O
seems O
to O
be O
genuinely O
afraid O
of O
standing O
up O
for O
herself. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
wedding O
is O
not O
the O
day O
to O
do O
it, O
I O
understand O
that, O
but O
OP O
may O
need O
to O
perform O
a O
legitimate O
rescue O
of O
N O
before O
things O
start O
to O
get O
physical. O
There O
isn't O
going O
to O
be O
that O
magical O
day O
where O
she O
wakes O
up O
and O
the O
truth O
hits O
her O
and O
she O
leaves O
on O
her O
own. O
Women O
in O
her O
position O
are O
in O
very O
real O
danger O
and O
need O
help O
getting O
to O
safety. O
[SEP]
This. O
[SEP]
I O
would O
add O
that O
you O
could O
tell O
her O
specifically O
what O
support O
you O
could O
offer O
if O
she O
ever O
felt O
the O
need O
to O
leave O
her O
husband. O
Could O
you O
give O
her O
a O
ride O
to O
a O
shelter, O
offer O
her O
a O
room O
in O
your O
house, O
or O
help O
her O
get O
a O
bus O
ticket O
to O
a O
relative? O
Knowing O
what O
her O
options O
would O
be O
if O
she O
needed O
to O
leave O
can O
be O
the O
thing O
that O
helps O
her O
get O
free O
ultimately. O
Ideally O
she O
would O
make O
a O
safety O
plan O
for O
what O
to O
do O
if O
her O
situation O
became O
untenable. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
it's O
more O
likely O
L O
was O
listening O
to O
the O
conversation, O
probably O
standing O
right O
next O
to O
her O
or O
on O
the O
line O
in O
another O
room. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Even O
then, O
OP's O
absolutely O
NTA. O
[SEP]
This O
woman O
clearly O
sounds O
like O
she O
is O
in O
a O
Domestic O
Violence O
relationship, O
and O
leaving O
DV O
abusers O
is O
most O
often O
not O
easy O
at O
all O
- O
not O
the O
least O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
often O
the O
abuse O
significantly O
escalated O
when O
the O
victim O
is O
leaving O
and O
the O
abuser O
fears O
that O
he O
is O
losing O
control; O
also O
btw O
the O
time O
when O
a O
majority O
of O
lethal O
incidences O
occur. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Of O
course O
she O
should O
leave O
(safely), O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
can O
for O
many O
reasons; O
but O
quite O
frankly O
the O
guy O
being O
a O
homophobe O
probably O
*right O
now* O
is O
not O
exactly O
on O
the O
top O
of O
her O
immediate O
concerns O
(that O
might O
be O
more: O
“I O
hope O
he O
does O
not O
hurt O
me O
or O
kill O
me O
today”). O
[SEP]
And O
if O
anyone O
responds O
saying O
she's O
in O
an O
abusive O
relationship, O
point O
out O
it O
takes O
people O
in O
an O
abusive O
relationship O
7 O
times O
to O
successfully O
leave. O
And O
they O
only O
leave O
when O
they O
want O
to. O
N O
doesn't O
want O
to O
leave O
yet O
and O
you O
don't O
know O
how O
long O
it's O
going O
to O
be O
until O
she O
does, O
or O
if O
she O
will O
ever O
want O
to O
leave. O
So O
your O
wedding O
isn't O
the O
time O
or O
place O
to O
force O
these O
difficult O
conversations O
& O
somewhere O
deep O
down, O
N O
knows O
that O
before O
L O
she O
would O
have O
made O
the O
same O
choice O
you're O
making O
now. O
[SEP]
She O
did O
not O
choose O
to O
be O
abused, O
and O
it O
can O
be O
extrememly O
difficult O
to O
leave O
abusive O
situations, O
especially O
when O
a O
child O
is O
involved. O
She O
may O
actually O
still O
support O
the O
community O
but O
she O
may O
be O
too O
terrified O
to O
let O
me O
know O
because O
she O
is O
being O
held O
under O
her O
boyfriends O
thumb. O
If O
she O
had O
told O
me O
she O
was O
still O
supportive, O
what O
if O
he O
was O
listening O
from O
the O
other O
room O
and O
decided O
to O
hurt O
her O
after O
she O
hung O
up? O
I O
want O
her O
to O
get O
help O
and O
get O
out O
but O
abusers O
are O
powerful O
and O
its O
not O
my O
place O
to O
meddle, O
though O
Im O
currently O
doing O
everything O
I O
can O
to O
set O
her O
up O
with O
a O
support O
system O
and O
resources. O
[SEP]
She O
is O
still O
my O
friend. O
Its O
not O
her O
fault O
that O
hes O
treating O
her O
this O
way O
and O
its O
difficult O
to O
leave O
abusive O
situations, O
especially O
when O
theres O
a O
child O
involved. O
She O
didnt O
choose O
that. O
She O
may O
not O
feel O
the O
way O
about O
the O
lgbtq O
community O
that O
her O
boyfriend O
does O
but O
unfortunately O
I O
cant O
take O
that O
risk. O
[SEP]
That’s O
not O
how O
abusive O
situations O
like O
this O
work. O
You O
don’t O
choose O
it O
that’s O
a O
poor O
take O
to O
have O

You O
are O
doing O
a O
shit O
ton O
of O
assuming. O
Nowhere O
in O
my O
post O
did O
I O
mention O
not O
supporting O
my O
friend. O
I O
want O
her O
to O
get O
help O
and O
get O
out O
but O
abusers O
are O
powerful O
and O
its O
not O
my O
place O
to O
meddle O
in O
anyones O
relationship, O
though O
Im O
currently O
doing O
everything O
I O
can O
to O
set O
her O
up O
with O
a O
support O
system O
and O
resources O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible. O
I O
have O
not O
cut O
her O
off, O
I O
simply O
uninvited O
her O
from O
an O
event O
where O
my O
lgbtq O
family O
and O
friends O
will O
be O
vulnerable. O
I O
made O
a O
decision O
to O
protect O
my O
loved O
ones. O
[SEP]
1. O
Yes, O
I O
am O
without O
a O
doubt O
100% O
concerned O
for O
their O
physical O
safety O
as O
well O
as O
their O
mental O
well O
being, O
so O
I O
am O
taking O
precautions. O
There O
are O
insane O
people O
everywhere, O
and O
literally O
anyone O
could O
snap O
at O
any O
moment! O
People O
in O
the O
community O
are O
being O
unalived O
solely O
for O
whom O
they O
choose O
to O
love O
or O
how O
they O
identify. O
Im O
developing O
a O
slight O
agoraphobia O
over O
the O
last O
few O
years O
simply O
because O
of O
this O
and O
its O
taking O
a O
lot O
out O
of O
me O
mentally O
to O
have O
over O
100 O
people, O
all O
with O
different O
mental O
illnesses, O
backgrounds, O
and O
perspectives O
in O
the O
same O
room O
already. O
2. O
The O
state O
of O
my O
friendship O
with O
N O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
my O
decision. O
If O
we O
hadnt O
talked O
in O
10 O
years, O
or O
if O
we O
were O
as O
close O
knit O
as O
two O
people O
possibly O
could O
be, O
I O
would O
still O
be O
making O
the O
decision O
to O
keep O
my O
loved O
ones O
safe. O
I O
never O
stated O
that O
her O
boyfriend O
was O
a O
narcissist, O
I O
just O
know O
that O
what O
I O
witnessed O
was O
abusive O
behavior, O
those O
two O
things O
are O
not O
exclusive. O
3. O
Ive O
asked O
guests O
not O
to O
bring O
gifts O
as O
me O
and O
my O
fiance O
have O
everything O
we O
need O
and O
want, O
because O
this O
is O
a O
celebration O
of O
love O
that O
we O
want O
to O
share O
with O
no O
obligations. O
[SEP]
Even O
if O
she O
is O
being O
abused, O
she O
called O
OP O
back O
when O
L O
wasn't O
around O
to O
apologize O
for O
his O
behavior. O
So O
when O
she O
laughed O
and O
said O
she O
didn't O
know O
if O
she O
agreed O
with O
what O
he O
said, O
she O
wasn't O
under O
any O
kind O
of O
threat O
which O
might O
have O
prevented O
her O
from O
speaking O
freely. O
(Presumably, O
if O
L O
had, O
say, O
cameras O
that O
also O
pick O
up O
audio, O
or O
bugged O
her O
phone, O
or O
something, O
she O
wouldn't O
have O
called O
OP O
to O
apologize O
for O
L O
in O
the O
first O
place, O
so O
she O
at O
least O
thought O
she O
could O
speak O
freely.) O
[SEP]
This O
is O
very O
important. O
He O
is O
trying O
to O
isolate O
her O
so O
she O
will O
have O
no O
escape O
route. O
Make O
it O
very O
clear O
that O
while O
she O
is O
not O
invited O
to O
the O
wedding, O
you O
will O
help O
her O
in O
find O
a O
safe O
place O
to O
stay O
if O
she O
ever O
decides O
to O
leave O
him. O

Lgbt O
people O
aren’t O
the O
only O
ones O
getting O

Women O
married O
to O
abusive O
spouses O
are O
also O
getting O
killed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It’s O
also O
not O
easy O
for O
abused O
people O
to O
ask O
for O
help. O
Saying O
that O
the O
abused O
person O
is O
enabling O
a O
homophobe O
by O
not O
standing O
up O
to O
him O
is O
blaming O
the O
victim O
for O
not O
standing O
up O
to O
the O
abuser. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
is O
very O
common O
for O
people O
to O
say O
“I O
don’t O
know” O
when O
they’re O
stuck O
in O
a O
situation O
like O
this. O
It O
usually O
happens O
when O
there’s O
an O
internal O
conflict O
between O
her O
belief O
of O
supporting O
lgbt O
people O
like O
she O
did O
in O
the O
past, O
and O
her O
current O
conditioning O
by O
the O
abuser O
to O
reject O
lgbt O
people. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
not O
saying O
that O
OP O
should O
invite O
the O
friend O
and O
the O
husband, O
because O
Op O
definitely O
shouldn’t. O
But O
what O
I’m O
saying O
is O
that O
the O
friend O
has O
supported O
lgbt O
people O
in O
the O
past. O
Now O
that O
she’s O
in O
this O
situation, O
it’s O
more O
empathetic O
to O
help O
her O
out O
of O
an O
abusive O
relationship O
(separate O
from O
the O
wedding O
of O
course), O
instead O
of O
condemning O
her O
for O
not O
being O
able O
to O
go O
against O
her O
abuser O
[SEP]
I O
feel O
that O
is O
what O
is O
happening O
too. O
My B-Family
aunt I-Family
has I-Family
been I-Family
in I-Family
an I-Family
emotionally I-Family
abusive I-Family
relationship I-Family
for I-Family
the I-Family
last I-Family
16 I-Family
years. I-Family
Over O
the O
years O
she O
began O
to O
repeat O
his O
points O
of O
view O
even O
when O
he O
is O
not O
around. O
It's O
been O
drilled O
into O
her O
head O
so O
many O
times O
I O
think O
she O
has O
come O
to O
believe O
that O
this O
is O
what O
she O
truely O
believes. O
OP O
could O
try O
and O
keep O
the O
invitation O
for O
N O
and O
only O
disinvite O
L, O
but O
N O
wouldn't O
show O
up O
without O
him. O
In O
this O
environment O
you O
can't O
allow O
the O
chance O
that O
L O
will O
show O
up O
with O
N, O
so O
they O
both O
will O
have O
to O
be O
cut O
from O
the O
guest O
list. O
If O
I O
was O
OP, O
I O
would O
still O
make O
sure O
that O
N O
knows O
that O
this O
is O
really O
about O
L O
and O
that O
OP O
will O
help O
her O
should O
she O
ever O
want O
to O
leave O
L. O

You O
may O
want O

reread O
the O

you're O

[SEP]
N O
probably O
is O
genuinely O
scared O
of O
him. O
But O
OP O
can’t O
save O
her O
unless O
she O
wants O
to O
be O
saved O
and O
that’s O
the O
sad O
reality O
of O
it. O
If O
she O
tries O
to O
make O
N O
leave O
now, O
it’s O
highly O
likely O
that O
N O
will O
end O
up O
going O
back O
to O
him O
anyway. O

‘Oh O
it’s O

he O

he’s O
sorry’ O
‘he O
only O
said O
it O

can O
see O
the O
red O
flags O

with O
rose O
coloured O
glasses O
on, O
they O
just O
look O

could O
tell O
N O
until O
she’s O
blue O
in O
the O
face O
about O
all O
the O
bad O
things O
about O
L, O

end O
up O
going O
back O

several O

it’s O

Sometimes O
they O
don’t O
get O
out O

out O

I O
think O
it’ll O
be O
hard O
for O
her O
now, O
especially O
with O
their O
baby. O
I O
think O
if O
OP O
wants O
to O
be O
a O
good O
friend, O
she’ll O
always O
offer O
to O
be O
there O
for O

be O
ready O

jump O
in O

help O

I’ve O
been O
in O
N’s O
situation. O
Twice. O
And O
it O
got O
worse O
and O
worse O
and O
worse O
and O
I O
didn’t O
leave O
no O
matter O
what. O
My O
second O
ex O
even O
threatened O
to O
stab O
me O
in O
the O
stomach O
with O
a O
knife O
while O
our O
son O
was O
laying O
in O
his O
Moses O
basket O
across O
the O
room. O
And O
I O
still O
didn’t O
leave O
him O
then. O
Because O
he O
had O
such O
a O
hold O
on O
me. O
He O
came O
back O
every O
time O
with O
apologies O
and O
flowers O
and O
loads O
of O
gifts O
and O
would O
get O
on O
his O
knees O
and O
beg O
for O
forgiveness, O
and O
I O
took O
him O
back O
every O
time O
because O
he O
made O
me O
believe O
that O
I O
was O
a O
horrible O
human O
being O
and O
that O
he O
was O
the O
only O
person O
who O
would O
ever O
want O
to O
be O
with O
me O
and O
I O
believed O
him. O
With O
everything O
he O
did O
to O
me, O
it O
took O
him O
kicking O
the O
crap O
out O
of O
me O
whilst O
holding O
our O
son O
for O
me O
to O
leave. O
I O
don’t O
know O
if O
you’ve O
ever O
been O
the O
situation, O
and O
I O
pray O
that O
you O
never O
have O
been, O
but O
it’s O
different O
for O
everyone O
and O
it’s O
easier O
to O
make O
comments O
looking O
in O
on O
the O
situation. O
I O
can O
make O
judgements O
about O
N O
and O
L’s O
relationship O
based O
off O
of O
what O
OP O
wrote, O
but O
I’ll O
never O
know O
their O
situation O
for O
sure. O
[SEP]
That’s O
fair. O
I O
don’t O
think O
OP O
is O
wrong O
not O
to O
want O
the O
guy O
anywhere O
near O
them O
though. O
Hopefully O
they O
can O
get O
her O
out. O
[SEP]
While O
being O
abused O
you O
start O
to O
change O
yourself O
for O
your O
partner O
you O
try O
to O
become O
more O
likable O
it’s O
practically O
brainwashing. O
She O
could O
have O
been O
confused O
and O
laughed O
as O
a O
nervous O
reaction O
[SEP]
as O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
abused O
and O
is O
both O
B O
and O
T O
I O
can't O
agree O
less. O
it O
is O
not O
the O
job O
of O
those O
around O
us O
to O
get O
us O
out O
of O
these O
situations O
and O
besides, O
it O
seems O
like O
OP O
has O
voiced O
concerns O
and O
the O
abuse O
isn't O
under O
the O
table. O
I'm O
sorry O
but O
abuse O
victim O
or O
not O
it O
is O
perpetuating O
homophobia. O
To O
the O
abuser O
she O
isn't O
going O
along O
with O
it O
because O
he's O
an O
abuser O
she's O
going O
along O
with O
it O
because O
she O
agrees O
and O
if O
she O
agrees O
then O
others O
agree O
and O
now O
not O
only O
are O
his O
actions O
of O
abuse O
okay O
but O
his O
homophobic O
ideology. O
I'm O
not O
going O
to O
pretend O
it's O
okay O
my O
best O
friend O
is O
saying O
I'm O
sinful O
and O
disgusting O
even O
if O
it's O
"because" O
of O
their O
abuser O

So, O
I O
currently O
live O
in O

I O
am O
familiar O
with O
these O
kinds O
of O

I O
hear O

see O
them O
everyday. O
Obviously O
I'm O
there O
myself O
after O
fleeing O
an O
abusive O
partner. O
[SEP]

I O
have O
sympathy, O
but O
the O
truth O
is, O
I O
*don't* O
understand O
these O
situations. O
It O
hurts O
my O
brain O
and O
my O
heart O
to O
listen O
to O
some O
of O
the O
things O
the O
other O
women O
say O
about O
going O
back O
to O
their O
old O
lives O
when O
they O
literally O
survived O
attempted O
murder. O

Several O
people, O
including O
my O
Stepmum, O
have O
made O
comments O
about O
me O
going O
back O
to O
my O
ex. O
I O
shut O
that O
shit O
down O
so O
fast. O
It O
makes O
me O
angry O
that O
anyone O
would O
think O
I O
could O
put O
myself O
through O
that O
again. O
Getting O
back O
in O
my O
own O
place O
and O
living O
my O
old O
life O
again O
is O
all O
I O
can O
think O
about. O

everyday O
and O
smoked O
weed O
like O
it O
was O
going O
to O
made O
illegal O
again. O
He O
constantly O
talked O
about O
what O
I O
needed O
to O
be O
doing O
for O
him, O
even O
though O
I O
gave O
up O
most O
of O
my O
possessions O
to O
move O
across O
the O
effing O
country O
to O
be O
with O
him. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
loved O
him O
so O
much O
and O
I O
will O
always O
treasure O
the O
good O
years O
we O
had, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
burn O
myself O
to O
the O
ground O
to O
baby O
his O
emotionally O
broken O
psyche. O
[SEP]
But O
she O
called O
OP O
to O
apologize O
for O
his O
behavior. O
If O
she's O
been O
so O
brainwashed O
by O
him, O
why O
do O
make O
the O
call O
in O
the O
first O
place? O
[SEP]
You O
want O
to O
reach O
out O
when O
you’re O
in O
that O
situation O
just O
sometimes O
you O
can’t O
do O
it O
safely. O
Which O
is O
why O
she O
waited O
while O
he O
wasn’t O
around. O
[SEP]
Right. O
She O
called O
when O
she O
knew O
she O
could O
speak O
safely. O
So O
when O
asked O
if O
she O
agreed O
with O
the O
things O
he O
said, O
she O
was O
free O
to O
say O
'no, O
I O
absolutely O
do O
not' O
– O
but O
she O
didn't O
say O
that. O

True O
story O
about O
my O
childhood. O
[SEP]
Names O
are O

[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
Regular O
Day O
in O
my O
childhood O
[SEP]
Sitting O
down, O
across O
the O
table, O
I O
could O
feel O
the O
panic O
rising O
from O
the O
pit O
of O
my O
stomach. O
She O
was O
starting O
at O
me. O
That O
was O
never O
a O
good O
sign, O
those O
eyes O
could O
kill O
spiders O
with O
a O
glance. O
Thoughts O
flitting O
across O
my O
mind. O
Why O
does O
she O
have O
to O
do O
this? O
Every O
other O
10 O
yr. O
old O
gets O
to O
go O
home O
and O
have O
cookies O
and O
milk O
waiting O
for O
them. O
They O
get O
to O
play O
video O
games O
and O
talk O
on O
the O
phone. O
They O
get O
tucked O
in O
at O
night O
with O
kisses O
and O
hugs. O
[SEP]
I O
shifted O
my O
weight O
while O
staring O
at O
the O
table. O
Swirls O
in O
the O
wood; O
I O
wonder O
what O
kind O
of O
tree O
makes O
this O
table O
so O
pretty. O
[SEP]
“Sally, O
look O
at O
me O
in O
the O
face” O
she O
spit. O
Realizing O
that O
I O
had O
tuned O
her O
out, O
which O
was O
a O
mistake, O
the O
worries O
of O
how O
I O
was O
going O
to O
fix O
this O
start O
going O
through O
my O
head O
at O
lightning O
speed. O
My O
chest O
began O
to O
tighten O
as O
I O
slowly O
start O
to O
raise O
my O
head. O
[SEP]
“I O
thought O
I O
told O
you O
that O
the O
dishes O
and O
kitchen O
needed O
to O
be O
clean O
before O
you O
went O
to O
school O
today. O
You O
made O
me O
look O
so O
stupid O
when O
she O
came! O
HOW O
DARE O
YOU!” O
Then O
she O
cuffs O
me O
upside O
the O
head O
as O
spit O
flew O
from O
her O
mouth, O
spoiling O
the O
clean O
table. O
[SEP]
“She’s O
going O
to O
take O
you O
from O
here. O
You’re O
going O
to O
go O
live O
with O
strangers, O
you O
deserve O
that”, O
I O
shifted O
slowly O
to O
the O
edge O
of O
my O
seat O
so O
that O
when O
I O
fell O
it O
would O
look O
worse O
than O
it O
was. O
I O
knew O
where O
this O
was O
going. O
Nowhere O
good. O
[SEP]
“I O
said O
look O
at O
me O
when O
I’m O
talking O
to O
you.” O
Anger O
lit O
her O
voice O
up O
making O
it O
sound O
so O
venomous O
that O
I O
physically O
flinched. O
My O
brother O
peeked O
around O
the O
corner, O
concerned. O
In O
the O
backroom O
I O
could O
hear O
my O
sister O
playing O
with O
the O
hot O
wheels, O
probably O
making O
a O
horrid O
mess. O
Glancing O
at O
her O
would O
only O
make O
things O
worse. O
Shifting O
in O
my O
chair O
even O
closer O
to O
the O
edge, O
I O
replied O
with O
a O
meek O
voice, O
[SEP]
“Yes O
ma’am, O
I’m O
sorry.” O
WHAM. O
I O
fell O
off O
my O
chair O
with O
an O
audible O
thud O
to O
the O
hard O
floor. O
“Sorry? O
You O
will O
be O
sorry. O
They O
are O
going O
to O
do O
horrible O
things O
to O
you. O
Rip O
you O
away O
from O
here O
like O
you O
deserve O
you O
lazy O
bitch”. O
She O
stood O
above O
me. O
But O
at O
least O
she O
hadn’t O
noticed O
my O
brother. O
[SEP]
I O
could O
hear O
my O
sister O
calling O
for O
him O
in O
the O
back O
room. O
He O
hesitates, O
as O
this O
happens O
she O
whips O
her O
head O
toward O
the O
sound. O
She O
sees O
him. O
[SEP]
“Mom, O
I'm O
sorry O
I O
didn’t O
mean O
to O
forget, O
I’ll O
go O
do O
it O
right O
now” O
I O
quickly O
get O
to O
my O
feet. O
“Right O
now O
won’t O
fix O
it” O
she O
replied, O
once O
again O
her O
attention O
focusing O
like O
a O
snake O
about O
to O
strike. O
But O
I O
could O
see O
her O
calming O
down. O
I O
slowly O
move O
past O
her O
to O
go O
into O
the O
kitchen. O
[SEP]
“She O
is O
coming O
Friday. O
Make O
sure O
this O
house O
is O
clean,” O
Her O
voice O
normalizing, O
as O
I O
could O
slowly O
see O
the O
thoughts O
moving O
across O
her O
face, O
I O
could O
see O
her O
shifting O
back O
into O
mom. O
It’s O
like O
watching O
her O
become O
another O
person. O
This O
side O
of O
her O
made O
things O
livable. O
[SEP]
“Spaghetti O
sounds O
good O
for O
dinner. O
Do O
we O
have O
bread? O
Garlic O
bread O
and O
spaghetti, O
you O
always O
make O
the O
best O
spaghetti” O
her O
voice O
was O
becoming O
normal. O
She O
attempted O
a O
hug. O
Forcing O
myself O
not O
to O
flinch, O
I O
hug O
her O
back. O
[SEP]
“Yes O
that O
sounds O
awesome.” O
Letting O
go O
a O
little O
too O
quickly, O
I O
feel O
myself O
relaxing O
a O
little. O
My O
brother O
and O
sister O
are O
playing; O
she O
is O
calming O
down. O
Dinner O
is O
planned, O
and O
she O
seems O
happy O
with O
it. O
[SEP]
Now, O
the O
trick O
is O
to O
get O
everything O
done O
before O
it’s O
time O
to O
get O
the O
kids O
to O
bed. O
[SEP]
“Love O
you O
mom. O
I’ll O
come O
get O
you O
for O
dinner. O
Isn’t O
the O
news O
coming O
on O
soon?” O
As O
she O
walks O
into O
the O
living O
room O
to O
watch O
the O
news, O
I O
grab O
the O
pot O
and O
start O
filling O
it O
with O
water O
for O
the O
noodles. O
I O
feel O
my O
body O
start O
to O
relax. O
That O
crisis O
is O
avoided. O

We O
didn't O
even O
get O

until O
I O

16. O
We O

telling O

horrific O
things O

drop O
us O

no. O

So O
we O

However O
none O

We O
have O
all O
hurt O
each O
other O
over O
the O
years O
bc O
we O
didn't O
know O
any O
better. O
Therapy O
for O
8 O
years O
taught O
me O
that O
I O
can't O
just O
pretend O
it O
didn't O
happen O
so O
they O
don't O
like O
me O
bc O
I O
won't O
sugar O
coat O
what O
happened. O
Right O
now O
none O

us O
talk O

each O

Idk O
if O
that O
will O
ever O
change. O
😕 O

Maybe O
one O
day O
your O

will O
get O

you O
all O
understand O
why O
you O
were O
the O
way O
you O
were O

can O
move O

it O
together, O
you O
can O
have O
some O
sort O

relationship O
[SEP]
I O
hope O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
I O
am O
the O
happiest O
I O
have O
ever O
been. O
Not O
having O
to O
worry O
about O
them O
and O
what O
horror O
is O
next. O
They O
both O
have O
kids O
that's O
the O
part O
that O
makes O
me O
sad. O
I B-Age
am I-Age
35 I-Age
and O
still O
debating O
on O
if O
I'm O
going O
to O
have O
one. O
The O

was O
just O
1 O
day O
out O
of O
my O
entire O
life O
before O
21. O
[SEP]
I'm O
opting O
out O
of O
children. O
That O
way O
I O
definitely O
won't O
be O
continuing O
the O
cycle O
of O
abuse. O
Also, O
I O
intensely O
don't O
want O
them. O
[SEP]
I O
get O
this. O
I O
want O
a O
kid O
but O
the O
cycle O
of O
abuse O
is O
making O
me O
2nd O
guess O
everything. O
I O
also O
have O
a O
genetic O
disorder O
that O
might O
be O
passed O
down O
so O
idk O
[SEP]
I O
just O
don't O
like O
being O
around O
kids. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also, O
I B-Mental_Health
get I-Mental_Health
crippling I-Mental_Health
migraines, I-Mental_Health
just B-Family
like I-Family
my I-Family
mom, I-Family
and O
I've B-Time
had I-Time
them I-Time
since I-Time
I I-Time
was I-Time

I'm O
not O

else. O
And B-Family
Alzheimer's I-Family
on I-Family
dad's I-Family
side. I-Family
And O
cancer O
late O
in O
life O
on O
both O
sides. O
And O
a O
predisposition O
to O
addiction O
on O
both O
sides. O
Apparently O
I O
might O
be O
a O
carrier O
for O
Downs. O
And O
that O

thing. O
Too O
many O
things O

The O
only O
thing O
I O

I O
look O
almost O

hanging O
out O
with O
my O
grandparents O
two O
years O
before O
I O

born O

I O
put O
them O
on O
Facebook O
with O
the O

and O
nobody O
has O
questioned O
it. O
They've O
been O
up O

anything. O

It's O
weird O
as O

It's O
like O
every O

picks O
one, O
new, O
shiny O
trait O
from O
the O
male, O
and O
completely O
throws O
away O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
DNA. O
It O
somehow O
feels O
wrong O
to O
end O
this O

streak. O
But O
it O
also O
feels O
wrong O

have O

[SEP]
Throwaway, O
but O
I’m O
a O
regular O
on O
this O
reddit. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
After B-Time
years I-Time
working B-Occupation
for I-Occupation
others I-Occupation
on I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
Snap-on I-Occupation
truck, I-Occupation
I’m O
looking O
to O
do O
my O
own O
thing. O
Snap-on O
doesn’t O
have O
much O
in O
my O
area, O
and O
I’ve O
seen O
first O
hand O
how O
corporate O
squeezes O
franchises. O
I’ve O
had O
a O
meeting O
with O
Cornwell, O
but O
am O
not O
sold O
completely. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
I’m O
thinking O
about O
buying O
a O
truck O
and O
stocking O
it O
full O
of O
good O
tools. O
Things O
like O
lang, O
koken, O
lisle, O
nepros, O
wright, O
gray O
pneumatic, O
sunnex, O
mayhew, O
gear O
wrench, O
vim, O
ez O
red, O
etc. O
the O
point O
is O
to O
have O
good O
stuff O
and O
a O
great O
selection O
at O
fair O
prices. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
I O
believe O
I O
can O
be O
competitive, O
but O
probably O
won’t O
beat O
Amazon O
on O
everything. O
Is O
that O
a O
problem? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Have O
you O
ever O
been O
on O
an O
independent O
truck? O
Would O
you O
give O
one O
a O
try? O
Am O
I O
missing O
anything? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Thanks! O
[SEP]
I’m O
sure O
you O
probably O
already O
know O
this O
but O
I’d O
reach O
out O
to O
the O
Mobile O
Tool O
network O
and O
see O
what O
it O
would O
take O
to O
get O
setup O
with O
them O
as O
a O
first O
step. O
I O
think O
an O
independent O
guy O
can O
make O
it O
as O
long O
as O
you’re O
good O
to O
your O
customers. O
Also O
take O
a O
look O
at O
what O
the O
Jersey O
Discount O
Tool O
guys O
carry O
those O
are O
the O
brands O
that O
would O
be O
worth O
selling O
too. O
[SEP]
I O
had O
an O
independent O
for O
years. O
Get O
you O
anything O
you O
wanted. O
Super O
nice O
guy. O
Did O
business O
with O
him O
so O
long O
I O
didn’t O
have O
a O
truck O
credit O
limit O
with O
him. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
you’re O
hurdle O
will O
be O
the O
lack O
of O
revolving O
credit O
line O
and O
warranty O
work. O
The O
truck O
functions O
as O
a O
line O
of O
credit O
for O
both O
the O
techs O
and O
the O
owner. O
Without O
the O
backing O
of O
the O
company O
your O
float O
will O
be O
difficult O
to O
manage. O
If O
you O
have O
experience O
managing O
multiple O
net O
30/60/90 O
accounts O
with O
separate O
businesses O
then O
you O
have O
a O
leg O
up O
but O
it O
will O
be O
tricky. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
are O
you O
planning O
on O
purchasing O
your O
stock? O
If O
a O
tool O
breaks, O
are O
you O
backing O
it? O
Will O
you O
swap O
it O
on O
the O
spot O
and O
send O
in O
the O
old O
one O
on O
your O
own O
credit? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
Amazon O
can O
have O
the O
thing O
in O
my O
hand O
by O
4am O
the O
next O
day O
and O
you O
only O
come O
once O
a O
week O
that’s O
another O
hurdle. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
assuming O
you O
won’t O
deal O
with O
boxes, O
but O
that O
is O
a O
huge O
margin O
item. O
Trade O
in’s O
on O
promo O
boxes O
and O
keeping O
the O
tech O
on O
a O
constant O
payment O
schedule O
is O
how O
you O
keep O
the O
lights O
on O
for O
30 O
years. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
not O
saying O
it’s O
not O
possible, O
just O
saying O
there O
is O
a O
reason O
it’s O
not O
more O
prolific. O
I O
am O
also O
not O
supporting O
the O
snap O
on O
mode O
either. O
I O
almost O
bought O
a O
truck O
about O
5 O
years O
ago O
but O
ultimately O
decided O
it O
wasn’t O
worth O
it. O
Snap O
on O
purposely O
keeps O
their O
trucks O
at O
about O
$100k O
a O
year O
net. O
If O
you O
exceed O
it O
then O
good O
for O
you, O
but O
your O
route O
will O
be O
divided O
up O
sooner O
or O
later. O
Owning O
multiple O
routes O
and O
hiring O
drivers/salesman O
to O
run O
the O
route O
at O
say O
80% O
of O
net O
is O
really O
the O
only O
way O
it O
would O
be O
“worth O
it” O
in O
my O
book. O
The O
ability O
to O
order O
tools O
straight O
from O
snap O
ons O
website O
also O
didn’t O
sit O
well O
with O
me. O
The O
truck O
basically O
becomes O
a O
credit O
card O
(that O
you O
under O
sign) O
and O
a O
warranty O
spot. O
The O
only O
people O
that O
need O
the O
truck O
are O
the O
people O
that O
need O
to O
make O
payments. O

If O
I O
knew O
of O
an O

(tekton, O

I O
would O
absolutely O
encourage O

do O
business. O
Currently O
we O
only O
have O
a O
Snap O

which O
I O
buy O
off O
of O
but O
the O

who O
is O
changing O

We O
have O
a O
independent O
guy. O
He’s O
geared O
more O
toward O
body O
shop O
work O
than O
automotive O
but O
he’s O
been O
around O
forever O
one O
of O
my O
coworkers O
has O
been O
buyin O
tools O
from O
him O
for O
like O
20 O
years O
lol O
he O
also O
sells O
stuff O
for O
the O
same O
price O
as O
they O
are O
on O
Amazon O
(gear O
wrench O
and O
sunnex O
and O
whatnot) O
not O
sure O
how O
maybe O
he O
has O
commercial O
account O
and O
gets O
things O
cheaper. O
But O
he O
also O
doesn’t O
have O
a O
set O
territory O
like O
other O
tool O
trucks O
so O
he O
can O
go O
where O
ever O
he O
wants! O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin. O
This O
has O
been O
on O
my O
mind O
lately O
too. O
[SEP]
Way O
late O
seeing O
this O
thread O
but O
I O
will O
say O
I O
have O
an O
independent O
dealer O
that O
came O
from O
one O
of O
the O
big O
brands O
and O
absolutely O
solid O
guy, O
carries O
most O
of O
the O
brands O
you O
listed O
and O
a O
few O
more O
and O
is O
always O
reliable O
and O
has O
good O
prices. O
Not O
sure O
if O
this O
is O
a O
pro O
or O
a O
con O
but O
he O
also O
has O
his O
own O
sorta O
premium O
you O
can O
pay O
monthly/yearly O
and O
you O
get O
so O
much O
off O
the O
items O
and O
some O
free O
stuff O
but O
has O
never O
pressured O
anyone O
to O
join O
[SEP]
\+1 O
for O
Mobile O
tool O

[SEP]
Thanks, O
I’m O
set O
up O
with O
them. O
So O
you’d O
give O
an O
independent O
a O
try? O
And O
you O
think O
an O
independent O
can O
bring O
enough O
to O
the O
table O
without O
shiny O
new O
epics O
and O
company O
flag? O
[SEP]
Nice! O
It O
makes O
me O
nervous O
because O
I O
haven’t O
seen O
any O
independents O
out O
there O
in O
my O
area. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Was O
there O
certain O
things O
you O
liked O
his O
truck O
for O
over O
the O
flaged O
trucks? O
What O
would O
you O
like O
to O
see O
on O
one O
that O
showed O
up? O
[SEP]
Yes O
that’s O
right, O
I’ll O
have O
to O
float O
the O
ra. O
I’ll O
purchase O
inventory O
from O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
wholesalers. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
plan O
on O
taking O
care O
of O
my O
own O
warranties O
out O
of O
my O
stock, O
then O
send O
it O
in O
later. O
The O
tricky O
part O
will O
be O
how O
far O
does O
that O
extend? O
Obviously O
I’ll O
warranty O
stuff O
I O
sell, O
but O
if O
someone O
has O
a O
product O
I O
sell O
and O
they O
didn’t O
buy O
it O
from O
me, O
I’m O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
should O
still O
cover O
it? O
I’m O
guessing O
it’ll O
be O
depending O
on O
the O
customer O
and O
the O
relationship. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
No O
probably O
won’t O
deal O
much O
in O
boxes, O
except O
maybe O
used. O
Again O
a O
bit O
harder O
when O
I O
have O
to O
carry O
the O
note O
on O
everything. O
[SEP]
Thanks! O
That’s O
actually O
why O
I O
started O
thinking O
of O
going O
independent. O
Lol O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
you’d O
give O
an O
independent O
a O
try? O
You O
think O
there’s O
a O
market O
and O
a O
place O
for O
them? O
[SEP]
Yeah O
looking O
at O
wholesalers O
it’s O
going O
to O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
shopping O
around O
to O
be O
competitive. O
Amazon O
is O
tough O
to O
beat. O
And O
in O
many O
cases O
I O
probably O
just O
won’t O
be O
able O
to. O
[SEP]
Oh O
really? O
Looking O
around O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
pretty O
plausible O
enterprise O
to O
me. O
I’m O
nervous O
for O
mostly O
previously O
mentioned O
reasons. O
[SEP]
On O
the O
snapon O
side O
here. O
My O
guys O
buy O
from O
me. O
They O
love O
the O
brand, O
but O
a O
large O
part O
of O
the O
loyalty O
is O
to O
who O
they O
buy O
from. O
I O
don't O
think O
you O
would O
make O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
money O
going O
independent O
as O
you O
would O
with O
the O
snapon O
brand O
at O
your O
back, O
but O
you O
would O
be O
free O
to O
do O
what O
you O
want O
as O
you O
want. O
[SEP]
I O
been O
in O
22 O
years O
so O
I O
like O
to O
see O
new O
shit. O
He O
carried O
a O
bunch O
of O
gear O
wrench, O
sunex, O
Milwaukee, O
Monster, O
but O
he O
could O
get O
you O
anything O
you O
wanted. O
[SEP]
Coyle O
tools O
is O
another O
independent O
guy O
on O
YouTube O
that O
might O
be O
worth O
your O
time O
to O
check O
out. O
[SEP]
If O
I O
had O
an O
independent O
truck O
coming O
to O
my O
dealership O
I O
would O
spend O
way O
more O
than O
I’d O
like O
to O
admit. O
I O
personally O
buy O
tools O
of O
quality, O
price O
and O
convenience. O
I O
think O
an O
independent O
truck O
would O
provide O
the O
perfect O
mix O
of O
all O
3. O
I O
think O
there O
is O
a O
good O
market O
for O
it. O
[SEP]
You O
aren't O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
beat O
Amazon O
on O
price. O
You O
may O
be O
able O
to O
find O
some O
wholesalers O
to O
buy O
things O
5% O
cheaper O
than O
Amazon O
but O
you O
won't O
be O
able O
to O
make O
a O
living O
selling O
cheaper O
than O
Amazon. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
will O
be O
selling O
service, O
convenience O
and O
easy O
payments. O
[SEP]
For O
sure. O
I O
think O
whatever O
the O
truck O
it O
should O
have O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
loaded O
in O
it O
and O
some O
of O
the O
oddities O
or O
new O
stuff O
you O
haven’t O
seen. O
[SEP]
And O
that’s O
kind O
of O
what O
I O
was O
thinking. O
I’m O
a O
bit O
afraid O
that O
it’s O
not O
as O
exclusive O
as O
a O
brand O
like O
snap-on. O
You O
can O
buy O
most O
of O
this O
off O
Amazon, O
and O
in O
many O
cases O
just O
a O
bit O
cheaper. O
I’m O
hoping O
having O
it O
in O
stock, O
financing, O
good O
service O
and O
warranty O
is O
enough O
to O
convince O
someone O
to O
buy O
from O
me, O
rather O
than O
shop O
the O
truck O
and O
go O
home O
and O
purchase O
from O
Jeff O
bezos. O
[SEP]
Personally, O
I O
prefer O
to O
keep O
my O
money O
local O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
and O
try O
not O
to O
support O
the O
huge O
guys O
like O
amazon, O
etc. O
The O
older O
I O
get, O
I O
see O
the O
importance O
of O
supporting O
the O
independents. O
I'll O
pay O
more O
(within O
reason) O
and O
give O
up O
some O
convenience O
to O
do O
business O
with O
people O
that O
I O
like. O

that O

what O

Is O
your O
question O
asking O
for O
help O
to O
see O
if O
your O
parts O
are O
compatible, O
or O
to O
help O
your O
price-performance/cost O
of O
total O
build? O
Right O
now, O
you O
are O
overspending O
a O
lot O
in O
various O
parts O
of O
the O
build O
and O
unfortunately O
have O
purchased O
the O
mobo O
already. O
As O
for O
performance O
and O
cost, O
I’d O
recommend O
a O
360mm O
aio O
for O
better O
looks O
and O
airflow O
although O
the O
tower O
cooler O
should O
be O
ok O
without O
heavy O
overclocking. O
Motherboard O
would’ve O
been O
better O
as O
z690 O
+ O
ddr4 O
since O
z790 O
is O
expensive O
and O
not O
really O
useful O
for O
the O
cost O
unless O
you O
use O
ddr5 O
(z690 O
is O
cheaper O
and O
has O
boards O
supporting O
ddr5 O
too). O
As O
for O
the O
ram, O
try O
to O
get O
the O
lowest O
cost O
of O
ram O
that’s O
3200mhz O
cl16 O
or O
3600mhz O
cl18. O
For O
the O
case, O
5000D O
is O
ok O
but O
overpriced O
imo. O
I’d O
look O
at O
cases O
like O
lancool O
iii O
or O
o11d O
and O
more O
budget O
g360a O
or O
lancool O
216. O
Psu O
definitely O
doesn’t O
need O
to O
be O
1000w O
platinum, O
look O
at O
https://cultists.network/140/psu-tier-list/ O
and O
get O
an O
A O
tier O
psu O
that O
isn’t O
too O
overpriced. O
For O
fans, O
you’re O
really O
splurging O
on O
rgb O
and O
looks O
but O
I O
guess O
it’s O
ok. O
[SEP]
I'm O
just O
looking O
to O
get O
impressions O
from O
people O
who O
know O
more O
about O
what O
they're O
talking O
about, O
so O
thank O
you. O
I O
chose O
the O
z790 O
over O
z690 O
because O
this O
particular O
board O
has O
a O
lot O
more O
back O
panel O
inputs O
that O
are O
useful O
for O
my O
work O
and O
the O
devices O
I O
have. O
The O
other O
thing O
is O
that O
I'm O
hoping O
to O
get O
the O
fans, O
the O
cpu O
cooler, O
the O
ram, O
possibly O
the O
case, O
or O
money O
to O
help O
purchase O
them O
as O
Christmas O
gifts. O
So O
with O
that, O
and O
that O
I'm O
not O
buying O
any O
new O
storage O
or O
OS, O
I O
feel O
okay O
with O
spending O
a O
bit O
on O
other O
parts. O
[SEP]
I've O
heard O
that O
AIOs O
can O
be O
overkill O
and O
less O
reliable O
than O
fan O
cooling. O
Do O
you O
have O
a O
AIO O
you'd O
recommend? O
And O
do O
you O
have O
a O
particular O
wattage O
you O
think O
I O
should O
get O
for O
a O
PSU? O
[SEP]
Ah O
I O
see. O
For O
aio O
I’d O
recommend O
Arctic O
freezer O
ii O
as O
it O
has O
quiet O
operation O
and O
great O
cooling O
performance O
(also O
has O
a O
vrm O
fan O
on O
the O
pump). O
For O
wattage O
I O
think O
1200w O
would O
be O
safer O
(I O
roughly O
estimated O
by O
750w O
times O
1.5 O
and O
added O
100w O
since O
you O
have O
3080 O
ti O
which O
can O
have O
voltage O
spikes). O
But O
1000w O
and O
even O
850w O
would O
probably O
work O
without O
problems O
(could O
limit O
oc O
potential). O
[SEP]
Ah O
so O
your O
problem O
with O
the O
psu O
I O
chose O
was O
with O
the O
cert, O
not O
the O
wattage. O
Thank O
you O
for O
your O
help. O

If O

your O

It O
is O
a O
healthy O
trait O
to O
feel O
competitive O
but O
your O
view O
of O
it O
is O
all O
wrong O
in O
my O
opinion. O
You O
do O
not O
want O
to O
see O
yourself O
as O
"superior" O
to O
your O
employees, O
you O
want O
to O
set O
an O
example O
for O
them. O
A O
superiority O
complex O
will O
get O
you O
into O
trouble O
down O
the O
road O
and O
cause O
issues O
you O
don't O
need. O
It's O
the O
biggest O
difference O
when O
transitioning O
from O
an O
employee O
to O
a O
business O
owner, O
you O
no O
longer O
have O
to O
prove O
yourself O
amongst O

the O
goal O
is O
to O
show O
you O

and O
are O
in O
the O
trenches O
with O
them. O
Never O
run O
a O
business O
with O
an O
ego, O
employees O
should O
be O

You O

Machiavellian… O

the O

you O

your O

is O
just O
vile O
in O
my O
opinion O
… O
now O
, O
I O
see O
business O
as O
a O
competition O
but O
I O
usually O
beat O
my O
competition O
the O
right O
way, O
by O
putting O
in O
more O
work O
than O
them, O
just O
for O
fun.. O
not O
to O
feel O
superior O
and O
humíllate O
anyone O
nor O

I O

just O
simply O

you O
even O
if O
you O
did O
all O
the O
manipulation O

in O

I O
would O
still O

I O

there’s O
a O

nope O
I’ve O
just O
always O
outworked O
everyone O
, O
i O
don’t O
compare O
my O

anyone, O
I O
set O
my O

I O
think O
one O

that O
your O

yourself O

your O

It O
comes O
with O
a O

I O

all O

cellulitis I-Health
on I-Health
the I-Health
left I-Health
side I-Health

the I-Health
back I-Health

I O
had O
three O
cuts. O
One O
below O
my O
ear, O
around O
toward O
the O
center, O
and O
one O
higher O
on O
my O
head. O
This B-Time
was I-Time
about I-Time
6 I-Time
years I-Time
ago. I-Time
It O
was O
so O
infected, O
they O
couldn't O
sitch O
it O
together O
and O
instead O
gave O
me O
antibiotics. O
It O
was O
yellow O
and O
green O
colored O
wounds. O
I O
took O
them. O
Weeks O
later O
I O
had O
a O
checkup O
and O
they O
looked O
at O
my O
head O
and O
said O
it O
was O
fine. O
But O
years O
later O

I've O
been O
experiencing O
pain O
at O
the O
back O

my O

the O

my O

It O
will O
happen O
randomly. O
I'd O
say O
three O
times O
a O
year, O
but O
when O
it O
does, O
it O
last O
for O
around O
3 O
weeks O
on O
end. O
I've O
been O
to O
the O
doctor O
since. O
All O
they O
do O
is O
give O
me O
pain O
medication. O
It O
does O
work, O
along O

advil. O
But O
every O
couple O

hours, O
I O
have O
to O
take O
more. O
Could O
this O

Could O
this O

Hello O
everyone, O
this O
is O
my O
first O
post O
here. O
I’m B-Family
not I-Family
a I-Family
gambler I-Family
but I-Family
my I-Family
brother I-Family
in I-Family
law I-Family
is. I-Family
He O
started O
gambling O
in O
2018 O
when O
he O
moved O
to O
Australia. O
He O
lost O
a O
ton O
of O
money O
and O
he O
vowed O
he O
will O
stop. O
He O
didn’t O
gamble O
for O
3 O
years, O
during O
which O
he O
had O
a O
baby. O
Everything O
was O
going O
great O
until O
he O
relapsed O
around O
6 O
months O
ago, O
and O
he O
lost O
around O
$12K. O
He O
promised O
he’d O
stop. O
But O
he O
relapsed O
again O
a O
couple O
days O
ago. O
Our O
family O
is O
tensed O
and O
really O
worried. O
I’d O
love O
it O
if O
you O
guys O
could O
give O
any O
suggestions O
on O
how O
we O
can O
help O
him O
with O
this O
addiction. O

You O

needs O
to O

This O
is O
the O

the O

this O
traumatic O
situation. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
advice. O
I’ll O
look O
into O
this. O
[SEP]
Currently O
his O
wife O
holds O
access O
to O
all O
the O
finances. O
But O
anytime O
he O
gets O
access, O
its O
like O
he’s O
a O
different O
person O
and O
a O
demon O
gets O
hold O
of O
him, O
and O
he O
starts O
gambling. O
The O
relapse O
I O
mentioned O
took O
place O
when O
his O
wife O
forgot O
they O
had O
an O
existing O
credit O
card. O
So O
I O
feel O
like O
this O
wouldn’t O
be O
a O
sustainable O
solution. O
[SEP]
Hmm O
that’s O
absolutely O
true O
but O
I’m O
hoping O
there’s O
a O
way O
to O
help O
him O
help O
himself? O
[SEP]
You O
can’t O
help O
him O
help O
himself. O
It O
his O
decision O
alone O
and O
he O
has O
to O
figure O
it O
out O
if O
he O
wants O
to. O
I O
get O
really O
annoyed O
at O
some O
of O
the O
“advice” O
found O
here O
that O
basically O
says O
someone O
needs O
to O
“control” O
the O
gambler. O
That O
will O
never O
work O
and O
instead O
brings O
other O
people O
down O
with O
him/her. O
I O
also O
highly O
disagree O
that O
gambling O
is O
a O
disease. O
What O
I’ve O
found O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
very O
addictive O
activity O
that O
is O
likely O
covering O
for O
something O
else O
in O
your O
life. O
Anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
quit O
can O
find O
resources O
and O
help O
and O
doesn’t O
need O
your O
help O
finding O
it. O

I O
did, O
by O
remembering O
how O
it O
used O
to O
be O
and O
how O
much O
everyday O
tasks, O
like O
buying O
groceries O
were O
a O
huge O
problem O
back O
then. O
[SEP]
One O
of O
the O
things O
I O
learned O
was O
that O
my B-Mental_Health
anxiety I-Mental_Health
can I-Mental_Health
be I-Mental_Health
triggered I-Mental_Health
by I-Mental_Health
my I-Mental_Health
thoughts I-Mental_Health
but I-Mental_Health
also I-Mental_Health
how I-Mental_Health
I I-Mental_Health
feel I-Mental_Health
physically. I-Mental_Health
[SEP]
Due B-Mental_Health
to I-Mental_Health
my I-Mental_Health
anxiety I-Mental_Health
disorder I-Mental_Health
I O
learned O
to O
"scan" O
my O
body O
in O
stressful O
situations. O
[SEP]
"There's O
too O
many O
people O
in O
this O
room, O
the O
air O
is O
so O
thick O
in O
here, O
I O
can't O
breathe O
properly." O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
like O
warm/hot O
weather O
for O
example. O
I O
think O
I O
struggle O
more O
mentally O
in O
these O
days. O
[SEP]
The O
physical O
symptoms O
of O
sweating, O
raised O
heartbeat, O
more O
focus O
on O
the O
breathing, O
because O
of O
the O
heat, O
are O
the O
same O
symptoms O
that O
appeared O
when O
I O
had O
a O
panic O
attack. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Another O
example O
is O
a O
bad O
night O
sleep, O
when O
I O
wake O
up O
and O
feel O
all O
mushy O
and O
not O
really O
fit O
and O
awake. O
[SEP]
That O
feeling O
of O
not O
being O
in O
the O
presence O
and O
feeling O
disconnected O
from O
reality O
is O
something O
I O
know O
from O
my O
panic O
attacks. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
look O
for O
the O
triggers, O
because O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell, O
from O
my O
experience, O
I O
could O
always O
find O
a O
trigger. O
It O
never O
came O
out O
of O
nowhere, O
at O
least O
in O
my O
case. O
[SEP]
Idk, O
for O
me O
the O
worst O
is O
migraine O
anxiety O
coupled O
with O
I-just-had-an-argument-with-my-partner O
anxiety. O
Thankfully O
I O
have O
a O
kind O
partner O
whose O
reassurances O
keep O
me O
from O
going O
off O
the O
deep O
end. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
in O
a O
similar O
boat, O
but O
without O
a O
probable O
cause O
like O
your O
chronic O
pain. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Maybe O
because O
final O
(college) O
week O
is O
approaching? O
My O
grades O
are O
fine O
though. O
😞 O
[SEP]
So O
I’m B-Health
on I-Health
a I-Health
medication I-Health
that I-Health
helps I-Health
with I-Health
daily I-Health
“normal” I-Health
anxiety, I-Health
like O
normally O
in O
my O
day O
I O
would O
feel O
a O
constant O
sense O
of O
foreboding. O
But O
occasionally O
I O
will O
get O
an O
actual O
panic O
attack O
that O
my O
normal O
medicine O
can’t O
handle, O
like O
this O
one. O
Usually O
it’s O
triggered O
by O
something O
like O
watching O
something O
scary, O
but O
sometimes O
it O
feels O
like O
there’s O
no O
cause O
like O
this O
time. O
When O
that O
happens O
I O
take O
an O
as O
needed O
pill O
that O
in O
around O
30 O
min O
calms O
me O
down. O
I O
don’t O
use O
that O
one O
often, O
it’s O
kind O
of O
for O
emergencies O
I O
guess O
because O
otherwise O
I’d O
probably O
want O
to O
go O
to O
the O
ER O
lol O
[SEP]
That’s O
true, O
I O
will O
admit O
prior O
to O
it O
actually O
getting O
bad O
I O
had O
noticed O
that O
I O
felt O
off O
for O
around O
an O
hour O
or O
two. O
I O
should O
have O
probably O
taken O
my O
medicine O
then O
in O
order O
to O
prevent O
it, O
but O
for O
some O
reason O
I’m O
really O
bad O
about O
taking O
preventative O
measures. O
I’m O
always O
like O
“maybe O
it O
will O
go O
away” O
or O
“maybe O
it O
won’t O
get O
too O
bad” O
when O
in O
reality O
I O
should O
take O
it O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
start O
feeling O
it O
coming O
on O
so O
that O
it O
doesn’t O
get O
bad O
in O
the O
first O
place O
[SEP]
Finals O
could O
be O
factoring O
in O
a O
little O
bit O
subconsciously O
maybe? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
trying O
to O
learn O
to O
not O
find O
a O
cause O
for O
it. O
I O
almost O
feel O
like O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
invalidate O
the O
anxiety O
by O
finding O
some O
hidden O
root O
cause, O
which O
can O
make O
me O
more O
anxious O
when O
I O
can't O
find O
one. O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
learn O
to O
cope, O
without O
searching O
for O
a O
reason O
or O
cause O
(which O
is O
not O
easy). O
[SEP]
Had O
that O
happen O
once O
😩 O
[SEP]
You O
can O
ask O
yourself O
what O
made O
you O
feel O
off? O
[SEP]
I O
am O
on O
medication O
and O
if O
I O
don't O
take O
it O
I O
will O
feel O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
medication O
wearing O
off O
and O
that's O
not O
pleasant. O
[SEP]
Idk O
if O
that's O
what O
you O
mean. O
[SEP]
Anyway, O
that O
would O
be O
a O
trigger O
in O
it's O
own O
way. O
I O
would O
look O
for O
the O
trigger O
that O
got O
you O
there O
and O
work O
on O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
it. O
[SEP]
By O
dealing O
with O
it O
I O
mean O
not O
getting O
lost O
in O
a O
downward O
spiral O
of O
rumination. O
[SEP]
Try O
to O
catch O
the O
thoughts O
that O
drag O
you O
down, O
make O
you O
feel O
anxious, O
etc. O
and O
put O
them O
to O
scrutiny. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
think O
"You O
are O
not O
strong O
enough O
to O
do O
this, O
it's O
all O
in O
vain, O
just O
don't O
do O
it", O
[SEP]
you O
can O
argue O
that O
you O
at O
least O
want O
to O
try O
it. O
[SEP]
If O
it O
doesn't O
go O
as O
expected, O
you O
can O
at O
least O
be O
proud O
to O
have O
been O
courageous O
and O
strong O
enough O
to O
overcome O
your O
fears O
and O
give O
it O
a O
shot. O
[SEP]
That's O
just O
one O
example, O
you O
can O
look O
for O
the O
thoughts O
in O
your O
head O
that O
probably O
just O
want O
to O
protect O
you O
from O
harm, O
had O
their O
time O
and O
place O
in O
your O
childhood, O
but O
haven't O
grown O
like O
you O
did. O
[SEP]
They O
still O
want O
to O
protect O
the O
little O
boy/girl O
that O
expresses O
itself O
in O
the O
emotions O
you O
feel. O
[SEP]
It O
can O
be O
a O
rabbit O
hole, O
but O
ask O
yourself O
the O
next O
time O
you O
are O
anxious O
what O
root O
lies O
beyond O
that O
specific O
fear? O
[SEP]
Fear O
of O
loneliness? O
Fear O
of O
failure? O
Fear O
of O
lack O
of O
support? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
that O
I O
have O
a O
fear O
of O
failure. O
I O
associate O
failure O
with O
emotional O
pain. O
[SEP]
Worthless, O
lazy, O
inadequate O
etc. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
to O
teach O
the O
part O
of O
me, O
that O
has O
this O
automatic O
response O
of O
thoughts O
to O
failure, O
that O
failure O
means O
much O
more O
than O
just O
these O
negative O
traits. O
[SEP]
It O
also O
means O
learning, O
growing, O
experience O
etc. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
have O
these O
patterns O
of O
behaviour, O
moral O
values, O
the O
do's O
and O
don'ts O
we O
have O
learned O
from O
our O
parents, O
teachers, O
friends, O
society O
from O
an O
early O
age. O
[SEP]
How O
strong O
you O
have O
to O
be O
to O
be O
a O
worthy O
human, O
how O
you O
have O
to O
behave O
in O
certain O
situations, O
etc. O
[SEP]
And O
I O
think O
these O
things O
can O
collide O
with O
the O
needs O
of O
that O
child O
in O
us, O
that O
is O
expressed O
through O
our O
emotions. O
[SEP]
That O
child O
is O
sometimes O
to O
weak O
to O
meet O
these O
demands O
and O
then O
we O
suffer O
emotionally. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
way O
to O
bring O
these O
to O
together, O
the O
"parental O
values" O
and O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
child O
is O
to O
be O
the O
rational O
adult. O
The O
referee, O
talkmaster, O
whatever O
to O
bring O
these O
parts O
together. O
[SEP]
They O
both O
have O
their O
arguments. O
"You O
should O
do O
this O
and O
that. O
You O
have O
to O
be O
like O
this" O
and O
the O
"I O
can't O
to O
this. O
It's O
too O
much." O
[SEP]
The O
role O
of O
the O
adult O
me O
is O
to O
hear O
their O
arguments O
and O
find O
a O
middleground. O
[SEP]
If O
I O
have O
an O
appointment O
I O
am O
scared O
of O
and O
my O
emotional O
(child) O
response O
would O
be O
to O
hide O
and O
don't O
do O
it, O
the O
other O
part O
says O
"but O
you O
have O
to O
do O
it O
(or O
you O
are O
a O
failure)", O
I O
give O
the O
alternative O
to O
try O
it. O
[SEP]
To O
give O
the O
emotional O
side O
breathing O
room O
to O
fail, O
and O
the O
expecting O
and O
demanding O
side O
to O
at O
least O
try O
it. O
[SEP]
It's O
a O
mess O
in O
a O
way, O
but O
it O
is O
what O
it O
is. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
hope O
you O
were O
able O
to O
find O
something O
in O
the O
things O
I O
have O
said O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
Oh O
yeah, O
it’s O
really O
hard O
just O
living O
with O
it. O
Because O
if O
I O
start O
to O
try O
to O
think O
of O
a O
reason, O
my O
mind O
will O
just O
fill O
with O
intrusive O
thoughts O
that O
freak O
me O
out O
and O
make O
it O
worse O

How O
do O
i O
deal O
with O
this O
pharmacy? O
[SEP]
Im B-Occupation
a I-Occupation
pharmacist I-Occupation
at O
an O
independent O
in O
a O
small O
city. O
Right O
down O
the O
road O
from O
my O
pharmacy, O
a O
couple O
of O
the O
chains O
closed O
due O
to O
short O
staffing. O
We O
are O
getting O
an O
influx O
of O
patients O
transferring O
in O
from O
them O
which O
is O
obviously O
great O
for O
business O
but O
theres O
just O
one O
problem... O
[SEP]
[SEP]
They're O
still O
billing O
fucking O
prescriptions O
over O
there. O
So O
i O
call O
them O
up, O
wait O
on O
hold O
for O
more O
than O
2 O
hours, O
and O
am O
eventually O
told O
that O
the O
pharmacy O
is O
closed O
due O
to O
staffing O
so O
they O
have O
no O
ability O
to O
reverse O
claims. O
They O
tell O
me O
to O
call O
a O
different O
store O
and O
do O
a O
central O
lookup/reversal. O
Fine. O
I O
call O
a O
different O
and O
still O
nearby O
store, O
wait O
on O
hold O
another O
45 O
minutes, O
and O
ask O
them O
to O
reverse O
these O
claims O
for O
me. O
They O
tell O
me O
they O
cant O
do O
the O
central O
search O
or O
whatever O
and O
that O
i O
HAVE O
to O
call O
that O
specific O
store O
to O
have O
it O
done. O
So O
i O
tried O
calling O
the O
original O
store O
again O
and O
was O
told O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
that O
the O
pharmacy O
staff O
were O
"on O
lunch". O
I O
called O
back O
one O
final O
time O
and O
was O
told O
that O
the O
pharmacy O
is O
closed, O
try O
again O
tomorrow.. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Patients O
that O
go O
over O
there O
are O
apparently O
being O
told O
the O
pharmacy O
is O
closed O
and O
turned O
away. O
I O
called O
Medicaid O
to O
ask O
about O
override O
possibilities O
and O
was O
told O
the O
dr O
would O
have O
to O
submit O
a O
PA O
for O
early O
refill O
with O
attached O
paperwork O
indicating O
that O
the O
pharmacy O
that O
originally O
billed O
the O
RXs O
was O
closed. O
In O
some O
of O
these O
cases O
by O
the O
time O
all O
of O
that O
actually O
gets O
done O
and O
submitted O
correctly O
the O
medication O
will O
almost O
be O
billable O
again O
anyway. O

Does O
anyone O
know O
any O
chains O
in O
your O
area O
that O
operate O

this? O
[SEP]
sounds O
like O
Walgreens. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
the O
good O
news O
is, O
if O
it O
is O
in O
fact O
a O
Walgreens, O
the O
prescriber O
might O
be O
able O
to O
help O
you. O
When O
they O
send O
an O
eRx O
WAG O
software O
automatically O
bills O
insurance O
99% O
of O
the O
time O
(bad O
for O
those O
of O
us O
trying O
to O
take O
care O
of O
Walgreens O
refugees. O
But O
likewise, O
when O
the O
prescriber O
sends O
Walgreens O
an O
electronic O
cancelation O
of O
the O
same O
script O
Walgreens O
software O
automatically O
reverses O
the O
paid O
claim O
99% O
of O
the O

So O
save O
yourself O
some O
hold O
time O
and O
ask O
the O
prescriber O
to O
cancel O
the O
Walgreens O
Rx O
electronically. O
A O
lot O
of O
my O
local O

have O

this O
request O

start O
by O
cancelling O
the O
Walgreens O
eRX O
before O
they O
even O
send O
us O
the O

2) O
I O

effect O

We O
leave O
it O
up O

"Walgreens O

it." O
If O
they O

it O
out O

rebill O
it O
when O

if O

happening O
to O
us O
with O
2 O
different O
CVS’s O
close O
by. O
They’re O
closed O
1/3 O
to O
1/2 O
of O
the O
time O
and O
peoples O
rx’s O
are O
still O
getting O
billed O
due O
to O
their O
auto O
data O
entry. O
I’ve O
filed O
complaints O
with O
the O
BOP O
and O
am O
instructing O
every O
single O
patient O
that O
transfers O
to O
us O
to O
do O
the O
same. O
If O
there’s O
no O
one O
in O
the O
pharmacy, O
auto O
data O
entry O
should O
be O
disabled. O
[SEP]
Report O
them O
for O
Medicare O
fraud. O
Fax O
a O
transfer O
request, O
and O
24 O
hours O
later O
file O
a O
state O
board O
complaint O
for O
failure O
to O
comply O
with O
request O
to O
transfer. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Do O
BOTH O
of O
those O
for O
every O
single O
RX O
that O
has O
this O
happen. O
I O
promise O
it O
will O
get O
fixed O
within O
1 O
week. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
a O
similar O
situation, O
but O
I'm O
not O
nearly O
as O
patient O
as O
you O
are O
to O
wait O
on O
hold O
for O
an O
hour. O
But O
in O
my O
area O
if O
we O
can't O
get O
ahold O
of O
anybody O
we O
just O
leave O
a O
voice-mail O
with O
all O
the O
information O
for O
transfer/reversal. O
This O
depends O
on O
your O
state O
laws O
if O
you O
can O
do O
this O
for O
a O
transfer, O
but O
if O
you O
are O
waiting O
on O
a O
reversal O
and O
have O
other O
stuff O
to O
do O
just O
leave O
a O
voice-mail O
the O
pharmacist O
should O
eventually O
get O
it O
and O
do O
it O
themself. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Those O
stores O
are O
probably O
over O
4 O
days O
behind O
on O
scripts,so O
they O
are O
just O
doing O
scripts O
for O
whoever O
walks O
in O
their O
store O
and O
ignoring O
the O
phones O
as O
much O
as O
they O
can. O
[SEP]
Have O
your O
patients O
initiate O
a O
complaint O
to O
the O
state O
board. O
Do O
NOT O
submit O
the O
claim O
yourself. O
[SEP]
Have O
the O
patient O
call O
and O
get O
it O
reversed. O
They O
don't O
have O
any O
other O
customers O
to O
help, O
you O
do. O
Sure O
the O
situation O
sucks O
but O
have O
the O
patient O
and O
their O
doctor O
work O
it O
out, O
they O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
sent O
it O
to O
the O
closed O
store O
in O
the O
first O
place. O
[SEP]
Contact O
the O
state O
medicaid O
fraud O
unit. O
[SEP]
When O
you're O
calling O
for O
these O
copies, O
just O
make O
sure O
or O
tell O
the O
pharmacist O
to O
return O
or O
reverse O
the O
billing O
claim. O
If O
you O
got O
a O
new O
script O
from O
the O
doctors O
office O
and O
the O
pharmacy O
has O
it O
billed, O
just O
tell O
the O
patient O
they O
have O
to O
call O
and O
have O
the O
pharmacy O
reverse O
their O
claim O
or O
they'll O
have O
to O
pay O
cash O
price. O
I've O
been O
on O
hold O
with O
Walgreens O
and O
CVS O
for O
30+ O
minutes O
before O
being O
able O
to O
speak O
to O
anyone O
and O
we O
can't O
do O
that O
and O
do O
our O
other O
jobs. O
[SEP]
Contact O
your O
state O
board. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Their O
corporate O
structure O
is O
potentially O
harming O
patients O
(in O
addition O
to O
giving O
you O
unnecessary O
stress/wasted O
time). O
[SEP]
Beyond O
how O
to O
get O
the O
prescription O
billed O
and O
filled O
for O
the O
patient, O
you O
should O
let O
the O
BoP O
know O
about O
this O
situation. O
I O
believe O
OK O
had O
to O
have O
walgreens O
attend O
a O
BoP O
meeting O
over O
the O
summer O
to O
address O
concerns O
about O
unscheduled O
closures O
of O
stores O
and O
the O
negative O
impact O
on O
patients O
(delay O
of O
care, O
closing O
pharmacies O
in O
a O
rural O
area, O
etc). O
[SEP]
You O
report O
them O
to O
your O
licensing O
body O
and O
tell O
the O
patients O
why O
they O
have O
to O
pay O
cash O
and O
give O
them O
the O
info O
to O
report O
to O
their O
insurance O
and O
the O
pharmacies O
licensing O
body. O
[SEP]
I O
would O
call O
your O
state O
board O
of O
pharmacy. O
Sounds O
illegal O
to O
charge O
insurance O
for O
a O
prescription O
you O
never O
sell. O
[SEP]
That O
does O
seem O
like O
fraud. O
Bill O
and O
not O
fill. O
Bill O
and O
fill O
and O
not O
dispense, O
and O
then O
perhaps O
never O
reversing. O
Auditable O
by O
a O
PBM O
as O
well. O
[SEP]
Bill O
out O
of O
pocket O
for O
all O
generics. O
Keep O
your O
price O
cost O
+12$. O
Save O
yourself O
time O
and O
effort. O
Brand O
names O
dont O
worry O
about O
filling O
them. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
also O
a O
Walgreens O
thing… O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If, O
say, O
pt’s O
ins O
was O
billed O
at O
Wag O
A, O
then O
Wag O
A O
closes O
on O
the O
day O
that O
pt O
needs O
the O
med. O
Pt O
can O
go O
to O
Wag O
B O
and O
get O
their O
med O
by O
paying O
out O
of O
pocket O
completely. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Then O
when O
Wag O
A O
opens, O
either O
pt O
or O
Wag O
B O
(preferably O
the O
pt O
ofc) O
calls O
Wag O
A O
to O
reverse O
claim. O
Pt O
then O
goes O
to O
Wag O
B, O
ask O
them O
to O
rebill O
their O
ins, O
and O
get O
a O
refund O
on O
the O
oop O
cost O
(which O
can O
be O
done O
if O
claim O
reversal O
and O
rebill O
happen O
within O
7 O
days) O
[SEP]
If O
it’s O
part O
D, O
call O
the O
fraud O
and O
waste O
hotline O
for O
whatever O
insurance O
it O
is. O
Tell O
them O
you O
are O
trying O
to O
fill O
scripts O
for O
their O
clients O
but O
Walgreens O
has O
billed O
these O
claims O
without O
filling O
them O
which O
is O
fraud. O
You O
could O
get O
a O
10% O
whistle O
blower O
payment O
for O
whatever O
fines O
they O
may O
levy O
agains O
Wags. O
[SEP]
Can O
you O
answer O
a O
question O
for O
me O
in O
inbox O
[SEP]
I O
have O
two O
stores O
in O
my O
chain O
that O
closed O
down O
where O
this O
was O
happening. O
Unfortunately O
a O
lot O
of O
scripts O
were O
“lost” O
for O
a O
day O
as O
they O
transitioned O
from O
one O
store O
to O
another, O
but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
they O
transferred O
through O
central O
search O
just O
fine. O
But O
the O
store O
where O
all O
the O
prescriptions O
are O
going O
was O
absolutely O
overwhelmed, O
as O
I’m O
assuming O
the O
store O
you O
called O
also O
was, O
and O
obviously O
only O
the O
pharmacist O
and O
a O
couple O
techs O
were O
experienced O
enough O
to O
have O
good O
standard O
answers O
about O
this. O
A O
store O
closing O
or O
weird O
internal O
transfer O
issues O
are O
not O
something O
that O
happen O
all O
the O
time. O
The O
stores O
that O
closed O
really O
didn’t O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
field O
transfer O
calls—they O
were O
busy O
taking O
inventory O
and O
packing/shipping O
out O
all O
the O
drugs O
to O
my O
own O
store O
(which O
was O
chaos). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
pretty O
sure, O
if O
only O
they O
had O
the O
time, O
the O
store O
you O
called O
could O
put O
in O
a O
ticket O
with O
their O
third O
party O
help O
desk. O
But O
they O
are O
probably O
dealing O
with O
100 O
similar O
issues. O
[SEP]
Email O
the O
state O
board O
and O
tell O
them O
the O
situation. O
Paper O
train. O
Lets O
close O
down O
those O
pharmacies O
for O
good. O
[SEP]
That O
sucks, O
OP. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
would O
just O
find O
a O
discount O
on O
all O
their O
meds, O
and O
tell O
them O
that O
you O
can O
rebill O
it O
with O
the O
insurance O
within O
7 O
days O
if O
they O
can O
get O
it O
settled O
at O
the O
other O
pharmacy. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can’t O
waste O
that O
much O
of O
your O
time O
on O
that O
BS. O
[SEP]
Bring O
the O
list O
of O
orders O
to O
that O
Chain’s O
district O
manager O
biweekly O
and O
have O
them O
reverse O
those O
claims O
overnight O
[SEP]
Whoa O
that O
is O
crazy O
to O
me O
that O
they O
bill O
an O
Rx O
before O
a O
human O
being O
even O
looks O
at O
it, O
and O
is O
a O
terrible O
practice O
if O
they O
can’t O
keep O
their O
stores O
open O
for O
business O
and O
there’s O
no O
other O
way O
to O
reverse O
the O
claims. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
honestly O
would O
consider O
lodging O
a O
complaint O
with O
the O
board O
of O
pharmacy O
for O
delaying O
patient O
care O
with O
this O
practice. O
Maybe O
if O
they O
are O
fined/inspected O
enough O
due O
to O
this O
bullshit O
they O
will O
have O
to O
reconsider O
this O
practice? O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
! O
This O
may O
be O
the O
play O
! O
i O
wasnt O
sure O
about O
rules O
naming O
pharmacies, O
one O
is O
walgreens O
but O
the O
biggest O
culprit O
right O
now O
is O
actually O
a O
rite O
aid. O
Do O
you O
know O
if O
they O
have O
a O
similar O
auto-reverse O
feature O
in O
their O
software? O
[SEP]
It’s O
like O
they O
think O
we O
have O
access O
to O
all O
drug O
info O
for O
every O
patient O
[SEP]
Just O
for O
future O
for O
future O
info….WM O
pharmacies O
started O
closing O
for O
Thanksgiving. O
We’ve O
always O
closed O
for O
Christmas. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
the O
way. O
Make O
sure O
the O
wheels O
of O
government O
know O
about O
the O
issues. O
Create O
a O
paper O
trail. O
If O
they O
refuse O
to O
act, O
the O
media O
will O
have O
a O
field O
day O
with O
it. O
Report O
it O
to O
your O
local O
and O
regional O
news. O
I O
did O
with O
the O
NYT O
and O
it O
made O
a O
big O
wave O
in O
the O
industry. O
[SEP]
> O
24 O
hours O
later O
file O
a O
state O
board O
complaint O
for O
failure O
to O
comply O
with O
request O
to O
transfer. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Not O
all O
states O
make O
it O
mandatory O
to O
transfer O
prescriptions. O
It O
is O
considered O
a O
courtesy. O
If O
the O
patient O
wants O
their O
meds O
at O
a O
new O
pharmacy O
have O
the O
MD O
cancel O
the O
original O
rx O
and O
send O
a O
new O
one O
to O
the O
new O
pharmacy. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
just O
taken O
to O
faxing O
a O
reversal O
request. O
[SEP]
lol O
in O
patients' O
defense O
, O
thats O
alot O
of O
work O
even O
if O
its O
a O
dirt O
cheap O
medication. O
and O
then O
what O
happens O
when O
theyre O
waiting O
on O
something O
expensive O
like O
insulin? O
[SEP]
If O
it's O
not O
a O
control O
drug O
just O
pull O
the O
Wag O
A O
rx O
to O
wag O
B, O
then O
store O
it O
at O
Wag O
B. O
This O
will O
reverse O
the O
billing. O
You O
can't O
pull O
controls O
so O
if O
it's O
control O
you're O
still O
SOL O
[SEP]
Why O
wouldn’t O
you O
just O
transfer O
the O
drug O
and O
auto O
reverse O
the O
claim? O
That’s O
the O
entire O
point O
of O
the O
system O
at O
Walgreens. O
[SEP]
Even O
if O
it’s O
not O
part O
D O
insurance O
plans O
want O
to O
know O
about O
these O
access O
to O
care O
issues. O
If O
there O
are O
many O
of O
them O
we O
can O
audit O
all O
lines O
and O
start O
taking O
back O
claims O
they O
can’t O
prove O
were O
picked O
up O
but O
it O
doesn’t O
do O
anything O
in O
the O
moment. O
Us O
non-dispensing O
pharmacists O
out O
there O
feel O
for O
you!!! O
[SEP]
All O
it O
takes O
is O
data O
entry O
to O
get O
a O
paid O
claim O
and O
tie O
up O
the O
insurance. O
Will O
probably O
sit O
in O
a O
queue O
for O
4-5 O
days O
before O
actually O
ready O
for O
dispensing O
at O
a O
retail O
pharmacy O
that O
is O
understaffed O
[SEP]
This O
is O
true O
for O
every O
retail O
pharmacy, O
though… O
You O
type O
the O
Rx O
and O
get O
a O
tentative O
claim O
through O
their O
insurance. O
The O
claim O
isn’t O
billed O
to O
the O
patient O
until O
they O
pick O
up O
the O
Rx, O
but O
still O
ties O
up O
any O
more O
claims O
for O
that O
drug. O
This O
prevents O
duplicate O
claims, O
and O
is O
a O
form O
of O
preventing O
insurance O
fraud. O
[SEP]
Rite O
Aid O
floater O
here O
- O
am O
pretty O
new O
- O
so O
far O
I've O
not O
seen O
an O
automatic O
reversal O
feature O
that O
works O
externally O
(we O
have O
an O
internal O
feature O
that O
lets O
us O
pull O
things O
from O
other O
Rite O
Aids O
without O
having O
to O
call O
them O
to O
back O
it O
out O
- O
this O
doesn't O
work O
with O
other O
pharmacies), O
but O
the O
doctor O
can O
cancel O
prescriptions O
and O
it O
will O
show O
up O
in O
the O
pharmacist O
exception O
queue O
as O
a O
cancel O
request O
that O
we O
have O
to O
approve O
or O
deny, O
requiring O
immediate O
action O
(even O
if O
we're O
behind, O
that O
is O
extremely O
hard O
to O
ignore O
as O
most O
of O
the O
time O
there O
are O
only O
up O
to O
5 O
things O
in O
that O
queue). O
At O
the O
very O
least, O
if O
the O
pharmacy O
is O
open O
it O
won't O
be O
ignored O
for O
very O
long, O
and O
only O
requires O
their O
fingerprint O
to O
cancel O
the O
prescription. O
[SEP]
Yes O
they O
do, O
but O
if O
the O
prescriptions O
are O
in O
transition O
from O
one O
store O
to O
another, O
it O
may O
not O
work O
properly. O
I O
believe O
the O
prescriptions O
have O
to O
go O
through O
some O
system O
transition O
where O
they O
change O
from O
central O
to O
local O
at O
another O
store. O
The O
scripts O
should O
not O
be O
“stuck” O
as O
billed O
at O
the O
closed O
store O
for O
forever O
or O
even O
for O
more O
than O
the O
first O
couple O
days O
of O
the O
transition O
though. O
If O
the O
matter O
is O
about O
a O
maintenance O
medication, O
I O
would O
suggest O
waiting O
a O
few O
days O
for O
the O
dust O
to O
settle O
and O
then O
seeing O
if O
the O
pharmacist O
at O
that O
store O
can O
find O
the O
RX O
at O
that O
point. O
That O
store O
is O
probably O
also O
understaffed O
and O
now O
suddenly O
has O
to O
field O
100 O
extra O
calls O
about O
transfers. O
You O
can O
try O
a O
less O
busy O
store O
and O
see O
if O
that O
works. O
Or O
even O
just O
having O
the O
patient O
fill O
it O
one O
time O
at O
that O
pharmacy O
that O
received O
their O
prescription. O
[SEP]
No O
there O
is O
no O
auto O
reversal O
feature. O
When O
a O
Dr O
sends O
a O
cancel O
request O
it O
has O
to O
be O
manually O
acknowledged O
by O
the O
pharmacist O
on O
duty O
before O
it O
is O
reversed O
out O
of O
the O
system. O
If O
it O
is O
ready O
to O
be O
picked O
up O
at O
a O
Rite O
Aid, O
another O
one O
could O
pull O
it O
from O
their O
system O
and O
put O
it O
on O
hold O
at O
their O
new O
location. O
At O
that O
point O
an O
outside O
pharmacy O
could O
possibly O
bill O
for O
it O
no O
problem. O
But O
if O
something O
is O
"in O
process" O
at O
the O
original O
Rite O
Aid, O
meaning O
they O
billed O
the O
claim O
but O
maybe O
it O
is O
in O
Ready O
to O
Fill O
or O
needs O
the O
final O
pharmacist O
verification O
or O
something, O
even O
another O
Rite O
Aid O
can't O
pull O
it O
without O
contacting O
the O
first O
one O
to O
have O
them O
cancel O
it O
back. O
I've O
had O
this O
happen O
many O
times O
and O
it's O
a O
bitch O
to O
have O
to O
try O
calling O
the O
original O
store O
to O
tell O
them O
to O
back O
shit O
out O
before O
they O
fill O
it O
so O
we O
can. O
[SEP]
When O
we're O
they O
open O
on O
Thanksgiving? O
My O
walmart O
pharmacy O
has O
been O
closed O
on O
Thanksgiving O
the O
6 O
years O
I've O
been O
there. O
[SEP]
What O
state O
doesn’t O
require O
a O
pharmacy O
to O
transfer O
an O
RX O
at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
patient O
or O
patient’s O
agent? O
[SEP]
For O
Walgreens O
- O
just O
find O
an O
open O
store O
and O
if O
patient O
needs O
the O
Rx O
quickly O
- O
call O
and O
explain O
the O
circumstances. O
Have O
them O
pull O
the O
script O
over O
to O
that O
store O
and O
to O
put O
it O
on O
hold O
(as O
long O
as O
it’s O
not O
controlled O
or O
have O
a O
complicated O
billing). O
If O
the O
patient O
doesn’t O
need O
it O
immediately- O
fax O
over O
the O
transfer O
request O
and O
put O
a O
note O
on O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Another O
way O
is O
to O
have O
the O
Md O
send O
a O
cancel O
Erx O
over. O
[SEP]
Haha O
I O
remember O
some O
RPh O
taught O
me O
this O
trick. O
It's O
ridiculous O
that O
it O
isn't O
more O
straight O
forward... O
[SEP]
not O
every O
retail O
pharmacy O
has O
automatic O
data O
entry O
before O
someone O
looks O
at O
it O
[SEP]
It's O
been O
several O
years O
and O
providers O
are O
still O
surprised O
when O
they O
send O
an O
eRx O
but O
the O
patient O
isn't O
able O
to O
pick O
it O
up. O
Thanksgiving O
would O
be O
so O
dead O
my O
PIC O
wouldn't O
schedule O
any O
Techs O
and O
pull O
the O
the O
shift O
himself. O
[SEP]
You're O
the O
one O
who O
made O
the O
claim O
to O
complain O
to O
the O
BoP, O
which O
insinuates O
it O
is O
a O
law/rule. O
What O
state O
are O
you O
in? O
Show O
me O
the O
state O
law O
or O
BoP O
ruling O
that O
states O
transferring O
a O
prescription O
is O
mandatory O
by O
law. O
Not O
how O
to O
do O
a O
transfer, O
but O
explicitly O
stating O
that O
transferring O
a O
prescription O
at O
a O
patient's O
request O
is O
mandated. O
[SEP]
The O
chains O
do O
now. O
Honestly O
it's O
great, O
takes O
away O
a O
lot O
of O
tedious O
work. O
[SEP]
I O
worked O
1 O
at O
rite O
aid. O
What O
a O
waste O
of O
time. O
I'll O
always O
remember O
some O
lady O
did O
all O
her O
Christmas O
shopping O
and O
I O
had O
to O
check O
out O
70 O
something O
items O
at O
the O
pharmacy O
register O
but O
didn't O
care O
that O
much O
because O
I O
was O
so O
bored. O

Rule O
§291.34 O
(g)(9) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It’s O
toward O
the O
bottom O
of O
that O
page. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So, O
now O
will O
you O
name O
the O
state O
that O
you O
think O
doesn’t O
require O
it? O
[SEP]
Yup, O
love O
it. O
Probably O
half O
of O
our O
rx's O
at O
Walmart O
go O
straight O
past O
input. O
[SEP]
It O
all O
chains O
[SEP]
Right, O
you O
can O
vacuum, O
dust, O
and O
pull O
out O
of O
dates. O
Then O
what? O
You O
still O
have O
6 O
hours O
until O
you O
close. O
I O
would O
finish O
up O
my O
CEs O
for O
my O
cert O
then O
read O
a O
book. O
[SEP]
All O
of O
the O
rest, O
until O
someone O
shows O
me O
proof O
otherwise. O
Texas O
is O
the O
one O
I O
knew O
off O
hand O
does O
make O
it O
mandatory O
and O
has O
a O
time O
limit. O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
strange O
too, O
but O
I've O
researched O
tons O
of O
BoP O
complaints O
and O
had O
inspectors O
confirm O
it O
for O
me. O
[SEP]
That O
you O
won’t O
name O
a O
specific O
state O
is O
putting O
serious O
strain O
on O
your O
credibility. O
[SEP]
NJ O
requires O
immediate O
compliance O
[SEP]
Again, O
*I* O
am O
not O
the O
one O
making O
the O
claim, O
*you* O
are. O
So O
unless O
you O
want O
to O
post O
links O
for O
the O
other O
49 O
states, O
your O
claim O
is O
unfounded. O
Unless O
OP's O
state O
has O
a O
regulation O
making O
it O
mandatory O
to O
transfer O
a O
script, O
the O
BOP O
has O
no O
teeth O
to O
do O
anything, O
so O
complaining O
to O
them O
does O
nothing O
but O
waste O
everyone's O
time. O
[SEP]
So, O
you’re O
actually O
just O
wrong O
and O
now O
you’re O
moving O
goal O
posts. O
You O
asked O
me O
for O
1 O
example. O
I O
gave O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
it’s O
your O
turn O
to O
own O
up. O
YOU O
are O
the O
one O
asserting O
that O
in O
49 O
states O
transfers O
are O
a O
courtesy O
and O
not O
mandatory. O
You’re O
full O
of O
shit O
unless O
you O
will O
go O
on O
record O
stating O
a O
specific O
state O
where O
this O
is O
true. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Otherwise O
you O
are O
just O

A O

We O

a O

I O

out O

If O

there's O
a O
group O
called O
United O
We O
Fall O
Kansai O
that O
usually O
does O
monthly O
group O
skates-- O
anything O
with O

Their O
most O
recent O
spot O
is O
a O
set O
of O
tennis O

of O
Yahataya O

near O
Osaka O

They're O
always O
super O

If O

And O
quick O
FYI, O

no O

I O
see O
a O

them O
in O

by O

I O
don't O
know O
if O
it's O

it O

[SEP]
The O
effects O
of O
progesterone O
vary, O
both O
physical O
and O
mental. O
Physical, O
it O
affects O
fat O
distribution, O
though O
the O
kinds O
and O
levels O
of O
effect O
vary, O
but O
many O
do O
like O
what O
it O
does. O
It O
does O
indeed O
affect O
libido O
for O
some. O
For O
some, O
it O
gives O
them O
more O
energy O
(but O
also O
sometimes O
needing O
more O
sleep). O
Mentally, O
the O
effects O
are O
all O
over O
the O
place, O
with O
some O
reacting O
very O
well O
to O
it O
and O
it O
being O
the O
best O
thing O
since O
sliced O
bread O
and O
others O
absolutely O
hating O
it, O
and O
everywhere O
in O
between. O
For O
me, O
it O
is O
an O
extremely O
strong O
anti-dissociative O
(mostly O
a O
good O
thing) O
and O
the O
physical O
affects O
have O
been O
rather O
mild O
but O
still O
nice O
subtle O
changes. O
[SEP]
The O
short O
answer O
is O
that O
medical O
science O
doesn't O
know O
exactly O
what, O
if O
anything, O
it O
does O
for O
transfemme O
people. O
There O
are O
anecdotal O
reports O
that O
it O
helps O
with/helps O
complete O
breast O
development, O
that O
it O
helps O
with O
feminine O
fat O
distribution, O
that O
it O
increases O
libido O
that's O
been O
lost O
as O
a O
result O
of O
E O
and O
antiandrogens, O
that O
it O
can O
have O
positive O
mental O
health O
effects, O
positive O
effects O
on O
sleep, O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
other O
effects O
that O
people O
list, O
but O
that's O
all O
anecdotal. O
It's O
really O
up O
to O
you O
whether O
you O
think O
that O
anecdotal O
evidence O
is O
sufficient O
to O
be O
worth O
trying O
it. O
Personally O
I O
tried O
it, O
had O
bad O
side O

and O
stopped; O
my O
sister O
tried O
it, O
saw O
very O
positive O
mental O
health O

no O

can O
tell, O
we O
have O
no O
freaking O
clue. O
Some O
say O
it O
helped O
feminization, O
some O
say O
it O
hurt, O
some O
say O
it O
did O
nothing. O
Some O
say O
it O
should O
be O
started O
after O
a O
year, O
some O
at O
tanner O
3, O
some O
never. O
It O
definitely O
shows O
up O
in O
cis O
girls O
puberty, O
but O
science O
isn't O
exactly O
sure O
WHY. O
With O
so O
much O
anecdotal O
evidence, O
and O
a O
near O
complete O
lack O
of O
scientific O
basis O
(even O
among O
the O
extremely O
undeveloped O
field O
of O
trans O
science), O
its O
up O
to O
you O
if O
you O
wanna O
talk O
to O
your O
doc O
about O
it. O
I'm B-Health
still I-Health
new I-Health
to I-Health
HRT I-Health
(only B-Time

so O
I O
of O
course O
have O
no O
first O
hand O
experience O
with O
it O
myself. O
[SEP]
I’ve O
been O
on O
it O
for O
maybe O
a O
year? O
My O
boobs O
are O
rounder, O
sure, O
I O
sleep O
easier O
at O
night, O
my O
sex O
drive O
came O
back O
after O
a O
year O
on O
spironolactone… O
but O
I O
can’t O
really O
say O
with O
absolute O
certainty O
that O
any O
of O
that O
wouldn’t O
have O
happened O
as O
a O
result O
of O
spiro O
and O
e O
alone. O
That’s O
the O
real O
challenge O
- O
isolating O
just O
the O
effects O
of O
progesterone. O

The O
small-ish O
community, O
years O
of O
stigmatization O
of O
trans O
issues O
and O
lack O
of O
money O
that O
can O
be O
extracted O
from O
said O
small-ish O
community O
has O
left O
us O
mostly O
in O
the O
dark. O
The O
answer O
is, O
as O
bad O
as O
cis O
female O
and O
minority O
science O
is, O
trans O
science O
is O
worse. O
Basically, O
white O
men O
are O
rich, O
and O
medical O
research O
wants O
moola, O
so O
white O
men O
get O
the O
science. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That's O
why O
these O
communities O
have O
formed, O
and O
what O
makes O
this O
whole O
thing O
so O
tough O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O
If O
the O
medical O
scientists O
aren't O
going O
to O
figure O
it O
out, O
we O
have O
to O
make O
due. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
only O
thing O
we O
all O
know O
for O
sure, O
is O
that O
you O
can O
look O
up O
cis O
female O
hormone O
timelines O
all O
over O
the O
internet. O
Progesterone O
comes O
into O
the O
female O
body O
something O
like O
tanner3 O
to O
tanner4, O
as O
menstruation O
begins, O
increases O
over O
time O
until O
a O
steady O
state, O
and O
then O
spikes O
as O
women O
get O
pregnant. O
Some O
say O
that O
female O
breasts O
don't O
come O
into O
full O
maturity O
until O
pregnancy, O
where O
they O
generally O
swell O
in O
preparation O
for O
feeding O
babies. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
this O
idealized, O
compressed O
cis-female O
schedule, O
where O
somewhere O
between O
recognizing O
tanner O
3 O
and O
tanner O
4 O
starts, O
introduce O
small O
amounts O
of O
cycling O
progesterone, O
and O
increase O
it O
slightly O
over O
time. O
And O
as O
I O
feel O
like O
I'm O
nearing O
the O
middle O
to O
end O
of O
tanner O
stage O
4, O
try O
to O
convince O
my O
doc O
to O
POUND O
that O
the O
progesterone O
into O
me, O
to O
simulate O
a O
pregnancy, O
for O
a O
short O
while. O
Pregnancy O
is O
a O
dangerous O
time O
for O
a O
woman, O
and O
progesterone O
has O
it's O
own O
list O
of O
side O
effects, O
but O
I O
want O
to O
look O
outwardly O
like O
a O
woman O
so O
bad, O
I'm O
going O
to O
do O
this O
"experiment" O
as O
close O
as O
possible O
to O
what O
women O
go O
through! O
[SEP]

Am O
I O

who O

how O

[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
of O
course, O
YMMV, O
IANAD(I O
am O
not O
a O
doctor), O
take O
the O
things O
I'm O
saying O
with O
a O

lately O

that O

polishing O

So O
we O

I O
heard O
that O
it's O
the O

spikes O
during O

when O
taking O

thinks O
you're O

acts O
accordingly. O
What O
could O
that O

I O

the O

are O
best O
for O
this, O
and O
obviously O
they O
aren't O
taking O
me. O
For O
clarification, O
I O
think O
I'd O
just O
like O
to O
apply O
to O
maybe O
5 O
schools O
just O
to O
see O
what O
happens, O
but O
most O
likely O
will O
delay O
for O
a O

and O
really O
pump O
up O
that O

I O
think O
with O
some O
intense O
studying O
I O
could O
have O
a O
17low O
going O

Who O
are O
some O
decent O

who O
may O
actually O
accept O
me O

even O

I O
can O

go O

Buy O
a O

do O

right, O
then O
branch O
out O
from O

Are O
you O
really O
considering O
experimenting O
with O
customer O
guns? O
[SEP]
Well, O
there's O
3D O
models O
and O
some O
website O
that O
does O
handgun O
comparisons. O
I O
think O
it O
has O
images O
with O
dimensions. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
can't O
find O
the O
dimensions, O
start O
out O
with O
glock O
and O
hit O
the O
other O
big O
name O
flagship O
pistols O
like O
the O
sig O
p320 O
and O
S&W O
m&p O
2.0. O
If O
you O
need O
the O
gun O
you O
could O
buy O
used O
on O
the O
cheap. O
Even O
LEO O
trade O
in's O
can O
be O
pretty O
cheap O
depending O
on O
how O
worn O
it O
is. O
If O
you O
only O
need O
the O

not O
the O

it O
should O
work. O

[SEP]
Absolutely O
not! O
That O
would O
be O
a O
very O
expensive O
experiment! O
I O
have O
ran O
this O
business O
for O
many O
years O
an O
am O
very O
familiar O
with O
engraving O
different O
materials O
but O
in O
this O
case O
it’s O
more O
or O
less O
having O
10 O
- O
20 O
of O
the O
top O
handgun O
templates O
ready O
to O
rock O
so O
if O
a O
customer O
comes O
in O
with O
one O
of O
the O
handguns O
I O
already O
have O
a O
template O
for, O
I O
don’t O
have O
to O
spend O
an O
hour O
or O
more O
making O
a O
template, O
I O
can O
just O
swap O
the O
artwork O
to O
what O
they O
want O
and O
go. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
other O
idea O
was O
to O
sell O
the O
templates O
on O
the O
side O
for O
other O
laser O
guys O
to O
use O
in O
their O
business. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
engraved O
a O
few O
Glock O
slides O
and O
already O
have O
a O
couple O
templates O
but O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
that O
don’t O
have O
a O
Glock O
so O
rather O
then O
buying O
slides O
for O
a O
bunch O
of O
different O
handguns, O
I O
figured O
I’d O
see O
if O
there O
we O
any O
image O
databases O
I O
could O
use O
to O
save O
some O
time O
and O
money O
making O
the O
templates. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you, O
I O
did O
look O
at O
them O
but O
3D O
is O
hard O
because O
you O
never O
know O
if O
the O
designer O
added O
something O
or O
took O
something O
away O
because O
they O
thought O
it O
looked O
better O
or O
didn’t O
render O
as O
well O
with O
it O
so O
3D O
is O
tough O
to O
trust O
in O
the O
accuracy. O
I O
can O
compare O
them O
to O
actual O
images O
but O
doing O
that O
for O
100 O
guns O
could O
be O
incredibly O
time O
consuming. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
did O
dawn O
on O
me O
that O
the O
pictures O
being O
dimensionally O
accurate O
isn’t O
really O
a O
problem O
as O
I O
can O
simply O
scale O
the O
template O
up O
or O
down O
accordingly. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Most O
important O
is O
that O
the O
images O
be O
flat O
profiles O
with O
the O
gun O
flat O
on O
a O
table O
and O
that O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
gun O
are O
the O
same. O
Other O
then O
that O
it’s O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
scaling O
the O
design O
which O
is O
very O
simple. O
[SEP]

I’ll O
probably O
just O
end O
up O
taking O
my O

can O
at O

get O

with O

We B-Finance

all I-Finance

I O
suggested O

we O

a O

if O
we O
sold O
the O

we'd O
give O
him O
one O

that O
we O
would O
need O

draft O
the O
document O
before O
A O
signed O
the O
quit O

deed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
turned O
out O
that O
A O
went O
to O
the O
lawyer O

signed O
the O
quit O
claim O
deed O
before O
we O
could O
make O
any O
such O
document O
(he O
is O
kind O
of O
dick O
so O
we O
were O
trying O
to O
draft O
a O
document O
that O
wouldn't O
accidentally O
give O
him O
more O
power O
over O
us O

he O
would O
have O

as O
an O

We O
got O

my B-Family

the O

over O

my O

also O
over O

I'm O
almost O
positive O
that O

do O
that. O
[SEP]

What O
I O
was O
really O
hoping O
you O

fill O

was O
the O

correct O
when O

that O
A O

for O
giving O
up O
his O

the O

was O
he O
just O
passing O
his O
opinion O

how O
we O

off O

something O
we O

I'm O

a O

I O

what O

I O

you O

The O

should O
have O
gone O
to O

his O

instead O
you O
got O
it. O
This O
needs O
to O

If O
that O
means O
selling O
the O

so O
be O
it. O
[SEP]

should O
see O
a O

how O
you O

charges. O
Do O
this O
proactively O
will O
be O
much O
better O
for O
you O
than O
if O
the O
state O
comes O
after O
you O
for O
it. O
[SEP]
Edited O
post O
to O
reflect O
that O
A O
paid O
the O
child O
support O
in O
the O
years O
since. O
(He O
used O
the O
money O
from O
his O
dad's O
estate O
to O
pay O
it) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
will O
bring O
that O
up O
with O
a O
lawyer O
when O
I O
talk O
to O
them O
though. O
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
advice. O
[SEP]
That O
makes O
a O
huge O
difference, O
obviously. O
But O
what O
he O
(and O
you) O
did O
5 O
years O
ago O
could O
still O
be O
a O
criminal O
act. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
At O
this O
point O
you O
own O
the O
house. O
He O
does O
not. O
It's O
up O
to O
you O
as O
to O
what O
if O
anything O
you O
want O
to O
do O
about O
this. O
If O
he O
tries O
to O
go O
to O
court, O
he O
would O
have O
to O
argue O
that O
you O
promised O
(verbally) O
to O
help O
him O
commit O
fraud, O
and O
then O
failed O
to O
follow O
through O
on O
it. O
It's O
a O
bit O
like O
a O
drug O
dealer O
getting O
ripped O
off O
in O
a O
drug O
deal O
and O
then O
calling O
the O
police O
because O
someone O
stole O
their O
drugs. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Talking O
to O
a O
lawyer O
is O
a O
very O
good O
idea. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Edit: O
just O
rereading O
the O
whole O
post, O
there O
is O
no O
legal O
"obligation" O
for O
you O
to O
compensate O
your O
brother O
for O
his O
share O
of O
the O
house. O
Apart O
from O
the O
whole O
child O
support O
thing, O
it's O
perfectly O
legal O
for O
your O
brother O
to O
receive O
a O
share O
of O
the O
house O
as O
an O
inheritance, O
and O
then O
deed O
it O
to O
you O
as O
a O
gift. O
The O
issue O
in O
court O
would O
be O
what O
if O
anything O
the O
two O
of O
you O
agreed O
on O
at O
the O
time. O
[SEP]
Again, O
thank O
you O
very O
much. O
Due O
to O
the O
multifaceted O
nature O
of O
this O
issue O
I've O
been O

figure O
out O
what O
kind O
of O

[SEP]
So B-Other
I I-Other

at I-Other
most I-Other
2 I-Other
or I-Other
3 I-Other
flights I-Other
on I-Other
Vat I-Other
sim I-Other
before, I-Other
but O
it's O
been O
a O
long O
while O
and O
want O
to O
get O
started O
again, O
had O
a O
question O
for O
controllers. O
Lately, O
I've O
been O
doing O
practice O
flights O
in O
the O
F-16 O
OR O
F/A-and O
mainly O
just O
like O
to O
cruise O
around. O
From O
what O
I O
remember, O
a O
flight O
has O
to O
be O
to O
a O
different O
airport O
than O
the O
one O
you O
took O
off O
from, O
but O
do O
you O
think O
controllers O
would O
mind O
if O
I O
did O
some O
back O
and O
forth O
patterns O
in O
the O
process? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
example, O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
flights O
consist O
of O
me O
taking O
from O
Edwards O
AFB O
and O
flying O
around O
in O
the O
restricted O
airspace. O
If O
I O
took O
off O
from O
Edwards O
and O
did O
that O
then O
landed O
at O
say O
Area O
51 O
do O
you O
think O
controllers O
would O
mind O
as O
long O
as O
I O
clearly O
stated O
my O
intentions. O
So O
it O
wouldn't O
be O
a O
direct O
flight O
and O
I O
could O
even O
provide O
a O
route O
to O
help O
to O
say O
I O
will O
be O
flying O
this O
specific O
pattern. O
[SEP]
There O
is O
no O
requirement O
that O
a O
flight O
has O
to O
go O
from O
point O
A O
to O
B, O
as O
long O
as O
you O
have O
a O
coherent O
flight O
plan O
and O
follow O
ATC O
instructions/basic O
regulations. O
If O
you're O
in O
uncontrolled O
airspace, O
you O
can O
basically O
do O
anything O
within O
the O
code O
of O
conduct. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I'm O
not O
sure O
how O
the O
airspace O
is O
structured O
around O
KEDW, O
but O
you O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
in O
contact O
with O
LA O
center. O
You O
can O
always O
ask O
the O
controller, O
but O
be O
prepared O
to O
operate O
within O
whatever O
clearance O
they O
give O
you. O
You O
should O
also O
respect O
that O
they're O
probably O
busy, O
and O
VATSIM O
isn't O
really O
the O
place O
to O
request O
a O
high O
speed O
pass O
over O
LAX O
during O
a O
Friday O
night. O
[SEP]
Thanks. O
I O
wouldn't O
request O
anything O
that O
crazy. O
I O
usually O
dont O
fly O
supersonic O
out O
side O
the O
proper O
airspace O
and O
in O
this O
instance O
make O
sure O
to O
request O
any O
high O
speeds. O
Usually O
I O
fly O
around O
M.85-90 O
so O
only O
slightly O
faster O
than O
airliners. O

I’m B-Location
actually I-Location
going I-Location
to I-Location
Covington, I-Location
and O
the O

express O
seems O

not O
stop O
in O

1) O
How O
likely O
am O
I O
to O
find O
a O
taxi O
waiting O
if O
I O
go O
to O
the O
taxi O
stand? O
[SEP]
2) O
Are O
there O
any O
reliable O
taxi O
companies O
that O
can O
arrange O
a O
scheduled O
ride? O
[SEP]
Might O
try O
Uber O
or O
Lyft O
there O
are O
usually O
plenty O
around O
airport O
[SEP]
I O
get O
Uber O
all O
the O
time, O
even O
at O
4am. O
Never O
had O
an O
issue. O
[SEP]
Frequent O
flyer O
here. O
You'll O
find O
a O
ride O
no O
problem O
with O
Lyft O
or O
Uber. O
You O
might O
have O
to O
wait O
15-20 O
min O
but O
someone O
will O
come O
[SEP]
I’ve O
used O
Moe’s O
taxi O
to O
get O
to O
the O
airport O
at O
4am O
and O
never O
had O
an O
issue. O
I O
do O
think O
you O
need O
to O
call O
but O
you O
should O
be O
able O
to O
borrow O
a O
phone O
to O
set O
it O
up O
[SEP]
Taxi O
service O
is O
very O
sketchy O
there O
and O
expensive. O
It’s O
a O
bunch O
of O
unmarked O
vans O
with O
a O
sticker O
saying O
they’re O
vetted. O
Said O
it’d O
be O
$75 O
to O
Oakley. O
Got O
a O
Lyft O
instead O
for O
$50. O
[SEP]
11pm O
isn’t O
that O
late O
flying O
into O
CVG, O
you O
won’t O
have O
any O
issues O
getting O
an O
Uber O
or O
Lyft O
at O
that O
time. O
I O
actually O
flew O
on O
a O
delayed O
flight O
into O
CVG O
and O
arrived O
at O
2am O
and O
was O
still O
able O
to O
get O
an O
Uber O
from O
CVG O
to O
Covington, O
now O
granted O
it O
was O
probably O
$40, O
but O
it O
still O
wasn’t O
a O
big O
deal. O
[SEP]
I've O
gotten O
airport O
ubers O
at O
5am O
before, O
my O
most O
recent O
time O
the O
guy O
told O
me O
it O
was O
already O
his O
3rd O
airport O
trip O
that O
morning, O
so O
he O
had O
to O
have O
been O
going O
by O
before O
4am O
[SEP]
So O
I O
just O
flew O
out O
early O
morning O
(left O
the O
house O
at O
5:00am) O
and O
in O
late O
(arrived O
at O
10:30) O
used O
Lyft O
both O
ways O
and O
it O
was O
completely O
painless. O
The O
only O
thing O
to O
know O
is O
where O
to O
meet O
your O
driver O
when O
arriving. O
After O
you O
walk O
out O
of O
baggage O
claim O
head O
to O
the O
right, O
keep O
walking O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
building O
(you O
will O
see O
signs O
that O
say O
bus O
transport) O
make O
another O
right O
and O
there O
is O
a O
parking O
lot O
straight O
in O
front O
you O
you O
that O
the O
driver O
will O
pick O
you O
up O
in. O
[SEP]
You O
won’t O
have O
any O
issues. O
I O
travel O
for O
work O
and O
never O
had O
an O
issue O
anytime. O
Not O
even O
during O
covid O
[SEP]
For O
the O
2X O
TANK O
route, O
if O
you O
purchase O
your O
ticket O
via O
the O
Transit O
App, O
it O
is O
valid O
for O
2hours O
with O
unlimited O
rides. O
That O
would O
cover O
the O
transfer O
to O
a O
#1 O
or O
#8 O
(both O
routes O
have O
a O
few O
trips O
after O
11:30pm). O
Probably O
not O
the O
fastest O
option O
(about O
45 O
min O
trip O
time O
including O
the O
transfer), O
but O
definitely O
the O
most O
affordable O
at O
$1.50. O
[SEP]
I O
second O
Moe’s O

service! O
513 O
808-1800 O
[SEP]
I O
always O
Uber O
to/from O
CVG O
and O
never O
had O
an O
issue. O
[SEP]
That’ll O
probably O
work O
on O
the O
way O
in, O
but O
I’m O
too O
afraid O
to O
rely O
on O
Uber O
at O
4am O
on O
the O
way O
out. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
taxis O
I O
tried O
to O
contact O
via O
email, O
but O
never O
got O
an O
answer. O
Maybe O
I O
can O
try O
calling O
with O

[SEP]

[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
wouldn’t O
rely O
on O
taxi O
service O
at O
4am O
any O
more O
than O
a O
rideshare O
[SEP]
I O
know O
it’s O
slightly O
different O
but O
my O
wife O
and O
I O
used O
Uber O
for O
our O
Disney O
trip O
when O
we O
left O
at O
530. O
You O
can O
schedule O
an O
Uber O
to O
pick O
you O
up O
at O
whatever O
time O
[SEP]
Schedule O
it O
ahead. O
I've O
gotten O
Ubers O
at O
4a O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
nowhere O
NC O
to O
go O
to O
work O
when O
my O
truck O
died, O
they're O
a O
little O
more O
expensive, O
but O
I've O
had O
better O
luck O
doing O
that O
than O
taxies. O
[SEP]
I’ve O
scheduled O
Lyfts O
in O
advanced O
at O
that O
time O
and O
have O
had O
zero O
issues. O
Plenty O
of O
drivers O
working O
the O
early O
morning O
flight O
crowds O
and O
red O
eye O
arrivals. O
[SEP]
I O
would O
feel O
comfortable O
getting O
a O
rideshare O
from O
Covington O
to O
the O
airport O
at O
4am, O
for O
sure. O
[SEP]
“Scheduling O
an O
Uber” O
isn’t O
actually O
scheduling, O
unfortunately. O
It O
just O
sets O
a O
request O
ahead O
of O
time O
to O
be O
sent O
out O
around O
5-10 O
minutes O
before O
your O
desired O
ride O
time. O
Uber’s O
own O
website O
says O
not O
to O
rely O
on O
it, O
as O
it’s O
not O
a O
guaranteed O
ride. O
If O
no O
one O
is O
around O
to O
accept O
the O
request O
at O
that O
time, O
no O
one O
will O
come. O
[SEP]
You O
can O
get O
an O
Uber O
in O
Covington O
24/7. O
You O
are O
right O
by O
the O
downtown O
and O
there O
are O
always O
plenty O
of O
drivers O
there O
all O
day O
and O
night. O
The O
only O
thing O
you O
ever O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
is O
if O
you O
cut O
it O
too O
close O
and O
the O
driver O
cancels O
at O
the O
last O
second. O
You O
will O
still O
get O
another O
driver O
but O
they O
will O
be O
10 O
minutes O
or O
so O
late. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
only O
time O
I O
hear O
people O
having O
trouble O
getting O
rides O
are O
when O
they O
are O
outside O
of O
the O
outer O
belt, O
and O
even O
that O
hasn't O
really O
been O
an O
issue O
recently O
(it O
was O

up O

I O
look O
around O
this O

and O
I O
see O
too O
much O
loneliness. O
In O
truth: O
we O
are O
everyone; O
alone. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
are O
born O
alone O
and O
we O
die O
alone, O
we O
all O
know O
this...but O
being O
"alone" O
and O
being O
"lonely" O
is O
not O
the O
same O
thing....we O
all O
know O
that, O
right? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
can O
feel O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Yeah. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
can O
be O
nice O
and O
perfectly O
fine O
to O
be O
alone...but O
when O
we O
after O
a O
while O
start O
feeling O
lonely, O
and O
even O
lonelier O
- O
our O
mind: O
our O
state O
of O
mind, O
it O
changes. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Many O
of O
us O
lack O
the O
tools O
to O
draw O
force O
and O
energy O
from O
that O
feeling O
of O
loneliness O
and O
it O
grows O
into O
a O
deeper O
feeling, O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
abandonment, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
phase O
on O
that O
interior O
journey O
that O
some O
of O
you O
are O
on, O
where O
I'd O
like O
you O
to O
find O
this O

Breath, O

a O

right O

right O
now: O
a O

inwards, O
towards O
your O
inner O
true O

a O
journey O
where O
YOU O
are O
your O

A O

that O
you O
are O
fully O
capable O
to O
make O
(even O

it) O
and O
that O

you O
might O
not O
yet O
have: O

self-trust. O

What O
we O

take O

something O
if O

Please O
know O

can O
become O
your O

your O

your O

We O
really O
do O

anyone O

it O

actually O
be O
rather O
useless O
to O
"be O
with O
someone O
else" O
before O
we O
have O
"been O
with O
our O

And O
this O
is O

we O
will O
be O
able O

connect O

a O

if O

with O
someone O
that O
also O
"hasn't O
yet O
met O
him/her/themselves/etc", O
no O

connecting O

If O
you O
are O
alone O

I'd O
like O
for O
you O
to O
know O

draw O
wisdom O
from O
knowing O
that O
being O
in O
such O
a O

another O
individual O

100% O
a O

you O

here. O
Does O
anyone O
know O
the O
history O
behind O
CA O
LEOs O
being O
afforded O
special O
privileges O
that O
regular O
Californians O
aren’t. O
Or O
can O
point O
me O
in O
a O
direction O
where O
I O
can O
read O
about O
it? O
[SEP]
Pretty O
sure O
the O
short O
answer O
is O
that O
they O
have O
a O
strong O
union O
that O
can O
heavily O
influence O
policy. O
The O
perceived O
importance O
of O
an O
endorsement O
from O
said O
union O
during O
election O
season O
gives O
them O
a O
decent O
amount O
of O
influence O
(this O
may O
be O
waning O
in O
recent O
years). O
And O
despite O
some O
of O
the O
current O
rhetoric, O
being O
soft O
on O
crime O
still O
hurts O
your O
polling. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
said O
union O
pushed O
for O
LE O
exemptions O
when O
the O
laws O
were O
being O
written. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Someone O
smarter/more O
knowledgeable O
on O
legal O
history O
will O
give O
you O
a O
better O
answer. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
want O
to O
know O
the O
history, O
look O
at O
the O
law O
that O
allows O
it O
and O
find O
that O
law's O
legislative O
history. O
It's O
available O
on O
Lexis O
or O
Westlaw, O
but O
if O
you're O
not O
a O
lawyer O
with O
a O
subscription O
to O
one O
of O
those O
services, O
pop O
down O
to O
your O
local O
law O
library O
and O
ask O
the O
librarian O
to O
help O
you. O
It's O
all O
there. O
[SEP]
modern O
california O

is O
based O
on O
humiliation, O

truth O

[SEP]
A O
lot O
comes O
from O
them O
being O
issued O

not O
available O
to O
civilians O
as O
well O
as O
full O

They O
often O
carry O
at O

the O

Some O

have O
their O

their O
own O

so O
they O
get O
access O
to O
the O
full O

of O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Same O
reason O
why O
LEOs O
must O
be O
20.5 O
years O
old O
before O
starting O
an O

Because O
if O
they O
were O
younger, O
they O
couldn't O
enter O

to O
enforce O
the O

[SEP]
[SEP]
They O
just O
have O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
law, O
and O
it O
was O
easier O
to O
just O
give O
them O
an O
exception O
paragraph O
when O
they O
were O
writing O
the O

[SEP]
I O
think O
a O
big O
part O
of O
it O
is O
"obviously O
the O
dogs O
of O
the O
state O
get O
privileges" O
and O
another O
part O
of O
it O
is, O
"they're O
professionals, O
so O
they O
can O
handle O
it, O
and O
you're O
not". O

it’s O
the O

I O

[SEP]
I'd O

anything O
from O

Did O

If O
so, O
it O
looks O

you O

ask O

or O
the O

if O

[SEP]
Not O
entirely O
. O
We O
were O
using O

our O

but O
as O
that O

being O

I O
also O
did O

I’m O
not O
looking O
to O
get O
anything O
but O
don’t O
want O
to O
give O
up O
half O
of O
what O
we O
have O
when O
he O

this O

We O
previously O
owned B-Finance
our I-Finance

made I-Finance
a I-Finance
little I-Finance

$106,000 I-Finance

so O
I’m O
getting O
used O
to O
my O
living O

being O
much O
lower O
than O
they O
had O
been. O
[SEP]
I O
simply O
wanted O
to O
know O
if O
I O
could O
retort O
about O
the O
possibility O
if O
he O
pushes O
things O
beyond O
reason. O
[SEP]
I O
suppose O
you O
now O
rent O
and O
that O
can O
be O
a O
lower O
standard O
of O
living O
than O
home O
ownership O
that O
you O
once O
had O
during O
a O
portion O
of O
your O
marriage. O
Will O
you O
need O
to O
move O
to O
a O
cheaper O
apt? O
Whereas O
on O
a O
salary O
of O
250k O
he O
can O
much O
more O
easily O
get O
a O
house O
(or O
luxury O
apt O
)and O
build O
equity O
again. O
Doesn’t O
seem O
fair O
that O
you O
cant O
participate O
in O
this O
largesse. O
If O
you O
are O
older O
don’t O
rush O
to O
divorce O
or O
if O
you O
don’t O
like O
your O
job! O
Not O
sure O
if O
the O
split O
is O
mutual. O
He O
seems O
to O
have O
it O
easy, O
not O
working O
for O
years O
and O
then O
being O
able O
to O
secure O
a O
high O
salary O
job O
that O
is O
much O
higher O
than O
his O
previous O
salary. O
The O
much O
higher O
salary O
jump O
seems O
off O
to O
me. O
You O
are O
entitled O
to O
maintain O
your O
same O
standard O
of O
living O
as O
you O
had O
during O
the O
marriage O
- O
that’s O
where O
the O
spousal O
support O
comes O
in. O
Also O
if O
you O
have O
been O
married O
for O
10 O
years O
you O
are O
entitled O
to O
1/2 O
of O
his O
social O
security O
earned O
during O
your O
years O
of O
marriage O
if O
it’s O
higher O
than O
yours O
at O
retirement O
and O
if O
he O
passes O
before O
you, O
you O
get O
his O
full O
social O
security. O
That O
could O
come O
in O
handy O
in O
your O
later O
years O
if O
he O
earned O
more O
than O
you. O
Seems O
like O
to O
me O
if O
you O
wait O
until O
he O
actually O
secures O
his O
job O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
he’ll O
keep O
it O
you O
would O
be O
better O
off O
getting O
some O
spousal O
support. O
You O
must O
have O
good O
health O
care O
too. O
If O
he O
has O
a O
retirement O
plan O
from O
past O
employment O
during O
the O
marriage O
you O
would O
be O
entitled O
to O
share O
in O
that. O
VA O
is O
an O
equitable O
distribution O
state, O
so O
the O
Court O
would O
look O
at O
what O
is O
fair. O
That O
might O
be O
much O
more O
of O
the O
10k O
left O
for O
you O
from O
the O
property O
division. O
Its O
not O
50/50 O
like O
in O

It’s O

from O
what O

can O
glean, O
NZ O

in O

it’s O

If O
you've O

use O
that. O
The O

If O

look O
at O

Thanks O
yeah O
I’ll O
probably O
do O
that. O
There’s O
just O
some O

such O
as O
the O

suddenly O

sometimes O
it O

(though O
the O

I O
was O
hoping O
it O
could O
have O
more O

I’ll O
check O
with O

too, O
if O
any O

the O

I O
am O
90% O
sure O
you O
can O
disable O
all O
those O

with O

It O

(About O

you O

Snorting O
4-ho-met O
doesn't O
make O
it O
stronger. O
None O
of O
the O
psilocin O
analogues O
work O
better O
intranasally. O
Take O
it O
in O
a O
capsule O
or O
roll O
it O
in O
toilet O
paper O
and O
take O
a O
larger O
dose O
if O
it's O
not O
strong O
enough O
for O
you O
instead O
of O
trying O
other O
roas. O
Oral O
bioavailability O
is O
not O
an O
issue O
with O
these O
substances. O
A O
good O
rule O
of O
thumb O
is O
that O
1g O
of O
shrooms O
is O
10mg O
of O
psilocin, O
so O
45mg O
is O
not O
a O
super O
high O
dose O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
psilocin O
analogues. O
Especially O
considering O
that O
I've O
seen O
psilocin O
analogues O
at O
90% O
purity O
and O
there O
could O
be O
even O
worse O
batches O
than O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
would O
say, O
it's O
possible O
your O
issue O
is O
purity O
of O
the O
product, O
but O
Idk O
what O
kind O
of O
tolerance O
you O
have. O
The O
issue O
is O
not O
bioavailability. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
also O
don't O

what O
you O

by O
mild. O
What O

are O
you O
looking O
for? O
I O
don't O
get O
a O
strong O
visual O
experience O
until O
I O
get O
close O
to O
70mg. O
[SEP]
I've O
never O
snorted O
it, O
but O
I've O
taken O
pretty O
high O
doses O
vaped/smoked, O
probably O
over O
100mg. O
No O
matter O
how O
hard O
I O
tried, O
it O
never O
got O
super O
deep. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
MET O
is O
one O
of O
those O
psychedelics O
you O
just O
have O
to O
enjoy O
it O
for O
what O
it O
is. O
A O
zenny O
tactile O
euphoric O
but O
mild O
psychedelic. O
[SEP]
Assume O
you're O
speaking O
of O
4-ho-met. O
Why O
snort O
it? O
Oral O
is O
more O
effective. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
reliable O
is O
your O
source O
and O
how O
positive O
are O
you O
that O
it O
was O
45mg's? O
I O
can O
promise O
you O
that O
an O
accurately O
weighed O
45mg O
dose O
of O
good O
metocin, O
even O
if O
snorted, O
would O
be O
one O
wild O
fucking O
ride. O
In O
fact, O
most O
people, O
including O
me, O
would O
think O
that O
45mg's O
is O
way O
too O
much. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
did O
just O
25mg's O
and O
was O
pretty O
surprised O
at O
how O
intense O
it O
was O
at O
times. O
[SEP]
Some O
mental O
relaxation, O
feeling O
calm, O
and O
bit O
sleepy. O
There O
was O
some O
bodyfeel, O
the O
bodyfeel O
was O
kinda O
is O
kinda O
nice O
and O
was O
the O
nicest O
part O
of O
it, O
but O
it O
was O
also O
moderate O
at O
best, O
and O
only O
for O
short. O
Almost O
no O
visuals O
apart O
from O
a O
bit O
brighter O
colours O
and O
very, O
very O
mild O
psychedelic O
overly O
over O
everything. O
When O
it O
comes O
to O
side O
effects, O
it O
just O
made O
me O
a O
bit O
jittery, O
but O
apart O
from O
that O
pretty O
much O
none, O
not O
even O
nausea. O
Can't O
forget O
about O
the O
smell O
tho, O
that O
was O
the O
biggest O
side O
effect O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
is O
it O
for O
you? O
And O
how O
much O
do O
you O
snort? O
[SEP]
It's O
not O
freebase, O
i O
wouldn't O
snort O
freebase. O
It's O
fumarate. O
Or O
at O
least O
it O
was O
sold O
as O
such... O
[SEP]
I O
am O
skeptical O
about O
boofing O
too. O
[SEP]
Idk O
either, O
but O
snorting O
it O
is O
as O
if O
a O
dead O
fish O
shit O
in O
your O
face O
[SEP]
\#BOOFSQUAD O

[SEP]
Iam O
not O
talking O
about O
4-HO-MET, O
that O
i O
only O
boof, O
works O
the O
best O
that O
way O
imo, O
saves O
a O
lot O
of O
material O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
talking O
about O
MET, O
the O
unsubstituted O
variant, O
related O
to O
DMT. O
Orally O
you O
need O
a O
load O
of O
that, O
like O
120-150mg O
according O
to O
psychonaut, O
if O
i O
remember O
correctly. O
That's O
why O
I O
want O
a O
way O
which O
requires O
less O
material O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
no O
tolerance, O
i O
haven't O
done O
psychedelics O
in O
a O
while. O
It O
might O
be O
purity, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
anymore, O
considering O
someone O
else O
also O
reported O
to O
be O
this O
way O
nasally, O
and O
that O
it O
has O
to O
be O
smoked O
for O
stronger O
effects. O
But O
the O
smell O
is O
really O
fucking O
off-putting O
[SEP]
[SEP]
By O
mild O
i O
mean O
no O
visuals O
apart O
from O
brighter O
colours, O
headspace O
consisting O
only O
of O
inner-peace O
and O
very O
mild O
euphoria/mood O
lift O
and O
mild O
bodyfeel O
(warmness, O
mild O
numbness, O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
tingling, O
feeling O
comfy) O
[SEP]
Okay, O
that's O
kinda O
surprising. O
Good O
to O
know. O
[SEP]
How O
intense O
does O
it O
get O
when O
vaped? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Yeah, O
makes O
sense. O
I O
mean, O
it's O
good, O
just O
not O
what O
I O
expected. O
I O
still O
like O
it O
[SEP]
Nope, O
I O
mean O
MET, O
the O
unsubstituted O
DMT O
relative O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also, O
with O
4-HO-MET, O
i O
would O
recommend O
boofing, O
it's O
considerably O
more O
potent O
than O
oral O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
source O
is O
pretty O
reliable O
and O
i O
weighted O
it O
myself O
with O
a O
pretty O
decent O
scale. O
[SEP]
With O
metocin O
i O
would O
be O
in O
another O
universe O
with O
that O
dose O
lol O
[SEP]
at O
doses O
of O
25-30 O
mg O
i O
get O
some O
nice O
mild O
visuals O
relaxation O
euphoria O
and O
mood O
boost O
i O
used O
these O
doses O
to O
go O
out O
in O
nature O
and O
just O
appreciate O
nature O
more O
i O
wasn’t O
really O
tripping, O
vaped O
the O
visuals O
get O
a O
lot O
stronger O
and O
it O
gets O
trippy O
i O
feel O
like O
snorted O
could O
be O
more O
recreational O
[SEP]
Maybe O
it's O
just O
bad O
quality O
then. O
Boofing O
should O
be O
stronger O
than O
snorting, O
and O
unless O
it O
hurt O
snorting O
it O
shouldn't O
hurt O
either O
when O
boofing. O
So O
maybe O
it's O
a O
better O
way O
but O
probably O
still O
not O
gonna O
be O
anything O
great. O
[SEP]
Ahh, O
sorry. O
Idk O
why O
I O
missed O
that. O
I O
can't O
help O
you O
with O
that. O
[SEP]
Boofing O
is O
life. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
fumarate O
tryptamines O
provide O
relatively O
little O
added O
value O
when O
snorted O
or O
boofed. O
Boofing O
in O
excess O
can O
also O
cause O
some O
legg O
blood O
vein O
damage. O
[SEP]
I'm O
trying O
to O
tell O
you O
it O
never O
really O
gets O
intense, O
maybe O
if O
you O
IV O
it O
but O
fuck O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I've O
put O
mine O
away O
for O
a O
while O
but O
next O
time O
I O
explore O
it O
I'll O
use O
in O
conjunction O
with O
psilocin O
or O
DMT. O
[SEP]
Me O
too, O
it's O
good, O
it O
just O
doesnt O
have O
the O
kick O
that O
some O
do O
[SEP]
Makes O
sense, O
i O
can O
see O
that. O
Maybe O
it's O
just O
different O
than O
i O
expected, O
as O
from O
what O
you're O
saying, O
the O
effects O
i O
got O
don't O
seem O
too O
far O
off. O
I O
just O
expected O
it O
more O
intense. O
I O
wasn't O
really O
tripping O
either, O
while O
I O
did O
expect O
a O
trip. O
And O
i O
mean, O
it O
was O
nice, O
don't O
get O
me O
wrong O
there O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
can O
you O
was O
it? O
The O
smell O
is O
awful O
already O
when O
I O
snort O
it, O
and O
if O
I O
had O
to O
vape O
it... O
Ew O
[SEP]
Also, O
how O
easy O
is O
it O
to O
vape, O
is O
it O
pain O
in O
the O
ass O
like O
DMT? O
[SEP]
That's O
also O
possible. O
Who O
knows. O
It O
hurts O
a O
little O
snorted, O
but O
compared O
to O
other O
shit O
it's O
fine. O
It O
shouldn't O
be O
a O
problem O
boofed. O
I'll O
try O
boofing O
some O
other O
time... O
[SEP]
I O
figured, O
i O
mean, O
if O
it's O
like O
this O
snorted, O
it's O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
that O
much O
better O
boofed, O
but O
still O
worth O
the O
try O
i O
guess. O
Even O
the O
effects O
from O
it O
are O
very O
meh O
[SEP]
No O
worries, O
happens O
[SEP]
Indeed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
does, O
it O
lowers O
the O
dosage O
needed O
tremendously O
[SEP]
Okay, O
i O
must O
have O
misunderstood O
you O
[SEP]
Fuck O
iv O
indeed O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
combo O
sounds O
pretty O
good O
[SEP]
Exactly O
[SEP]
its O
not O
super O
difficult O
to O
vape O
actually O
i O
didn’t O
mind O
the O
taste O
while O
snorting O
and O
vaping O
its O
completely O
fine O
for O
me. O
I B-Other
actually I-Other
like I-Other
the I-Other
effects I-Other
a I-Other
lot I-Other
of I-Other
MET I-Other
it O
grants O
me O
somewhat O
of O
an O
„inner-peace“ O
feeling O
[SEP]
For O
sure. O
I O
am O
curious O
how O
it O
will O
turn O
out. O
Maybe O
MET O
is O
not O
a O
very O
good O
drug O
either. O
Its O
analogous O
compound O
4-HO-MET O
is O
much O
more O
popular O
for O
some O
reason O
haha O
[SEP]
How O
do O
you O
vape O
it, O
with O
what O
method? O
[SEP]
You O
probably O
have O
a O
different, O
better O
batch. O
For O
me O
the O
smell O
is O
very O
much O
not O
okay, O
as O
I O
said, O
it O
smells O
like O
dead O
fish O
shit. O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
i O
like O
that O
too, O
it O
was O
probably O
the O
nicest O
part O
of O
it. O
In O
kinda O
similar O
fashion O
to O
DMT, O
but O
not O
nearly O
as O
strong. O
[SEP]
Looking O
bad, O
it O
was O
actually O
kinda O
good, O
just O
not O
as O
strong O
as O
i O
would O
expect O
[SEP]
Kam O
curious O
too. O
[SEP]
I O
wouldn't O
say O
that O
it's O
bad, O
it O
feels O
good, O
it's O
nice, O
but O
it's O
so O
mild, O
it's O
not O
even O
a O
trip. O
But O
someone O
else O
said O
that O
they O
experience O
something O
similar O
to O
that, O
so O
maybe O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
that O
way O
when O
snorted. O
[SEP]
It O
should O
be O
lit O
more O
intense O
when O
vaped, O
but O
i O
can't O
imagine O
vaping O
that O
putrid O
smelling O
shit. O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
and O
i O
can O
see O
why, O
4-HO-MET O
is O
great. O
One O
of O
my O
favorites O
psychedelics O
[SEP]
i O
even O
vaped O
the O
fumarate O
salt O
just O
put O
it O
in O
a O
oil O
burner O
and O
hit O
it O
[SEP]
Okay, O
cool, O
I'll O
try O
that, O
thanks O
[SEP]
just O
increase O
the O
dose O
too O
MET O
seems O
rather O
forgiving O
like O
it’s O
4-HO O
brother O
does O
too O
[SEP]
I O
would O
increase O
the O
dose O
snorted, O
but O
i O
don't O
have O
much O
of O
it O
and O
don't O
want O
to O
use O
up O
half O
of O
it O
one O
one O
trip, O
so... O
Yeah. O
Glad O
to O
hear O
that O
it's O
so O
forgiving. O

Trevor. O

So O
Trevor’s O
first O
language O
isn’t O
English O
and O
he O
learned O
English O
through O
me O
and O
my B-Family
older I-Family
sister I-Family
who I-Family
used I-Family
to I-Family
live I-Family
abroad I-Family
and O
mostly O
from O
these O
very O
cringey O
YouTubers O
that O
neither O
me O

my O
best O

like. O
Let’s O
just O
say O
they O
aren’t O
the O
best O
examples O
for O

[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
little O
brother O
(10M) B-Age_Gender
is O
my O
pride O
and O
joy O
and O
I O
love O
him O
more O
than O
I O
love O
anything O
else O
in O
the O
world, O
so O
while O
my O
parents O
were O
out O
for O
vacation O
they O
put O
me O
and O
my O
siblings O
in O
the O
care O
of O
my B-Family
uncle I-Family
(a I-Family
doctor) I-Family
my I-Family
grandfather I-Family
(retired I-Family
nurse) I-Family
and O
we O
also O
had O
a O
caretaker O
for O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
been O
with O
us O
for O
four O
years, O
so O
we’re O
doing O
fine. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
here’s O
where O
I O
might O
be O
an O
asshole. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
night O
before O
they O
left, O
my O
brother O
got O
frustrated O
that O
the O
Wi-Fi O
was O
gone O
(we’d O
been O
using O
their O
Wi-Fi O
and O
they O
had O
packed O
it O
up) O
and O
my O
other O
brother O
(16M B-Age_Gender
cerebral B-Health
palsy) I-Health
was O
screaming O
for O
the O
same O
reason. O
My O
little O
brother O
got O
overstimulated O
quickly O
because O
along O
with O
the O
screaming, O
Trevor O
was O
playing O
one O
of O
his O
offline O
games O
and O
raging O
at O
losing O
against O
the O
computer. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
At O
first O
I O
tried O
asking O
Trevor O
to O
turn O
down O
the O
volume, O
and O
explained O
to O
him O
that O
since O
my B-Family
little I-Family
brother I-Family
was I-Family
autistic, I-Family
loud O
noises O
really O
made O
him O
upset. O
Trevor O
agreed O
at O
first, O
but O
quickly O
went O
back O
to O
hurling O
curses O
at O
his O
IPad. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
caretaker O
was O
trying O
to O
help O
as O
best O
she O
could O
to O
her O
credit, O
and O
my O
sister O
was O
trying O
to O
calm O
down O
our O
other O
brother. O
Meanwhile O
Trevor O
was O
making O
these O
monkey O
sounds O
that O
sounded O
like O
he O
was O
mocking O
my O
brother O
who O
was O
at O
the O
time O
curled O
up O
with O
me, O
covering O
his O
ears. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
told O
Trevor O
a O
second O
time, O
more O
forcefully O
to O
please O
stop O
because O
it O
really O
wasn’t O
helping O
the O
situation O
and O
he O
told O
me O
it O
wasn’t O
his O
fault O
my O
brother O
was O
upset. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
tried O
telling O
him O
again O
that O
my B-Family
brother I-Family
was I-Family
special I-Family
needs I-Family
and O
he O
needed O
quiet, O
to O
which O
my O
cousin O
told O
me O
her O
brother O
knows O
that O
but O
he O
can’t O
be O
blamed O
for O
my O
brother’s O
meltdowns. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
To O
her O
credit, O
she O
also O
asked O
Trevor O
to O
either O
stop O
yelling O
or O
turn O
off O
his O
game, O
to O
which O
he O
proceeded O
to O
ignore O
us O
both. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
cousin O
tells O
me O
I O
shouldn’t O
expect O
Trevor O
to O
conform O
to O
our O
rules, O
and O
my O
sister O
says O
it O
isn’t O
my O
brother’s O

his O

out O

[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
no O
other O
advice O
to O
offer O
other O
than O
what O
worked O
for O
me. O
I O
have O
a O
pretty O
checkered O
past O
(that's O
the O
most O
I'm O
willing O
to O
say O
on O
my O
main), O
but O
most O
everything O
but O
some O
financial O
wreckage O
was O
almost O
3 O
years O
in O
the O
past O
when O
I O
went O
through O
a O
public O
trust O
background O
check. O
Different O
animal, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
same O
principles O
apply: O
be O
completely O
honest. O
Don't O
even O
try O
to O
act O
like O
you're O
hiding O
anything O
or O
try O
to O
sugarcoat O
it. O
That O
got O
me O
through. O
I've O
never O
been O
military, O
so O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
penalties O
(beyond O
being O
denied O
a O
clearance) O
you O
might O
or O
might O
not O
be O
facing. O
If O
you O
haven't O
actually O
enlisted O
yet, O
it O
would O
probably O
be O
better O
than O
if O
you O
have. O
If O
you O
can O
still O
back O
out, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
consider O
it. O
That's O
what O
I'd O
do, O
but O
that's O
total O
gut O
reaction O
based O
on O
nothing O
other O
than O
a O
strong O
sense O
of O

I O
was O
searching O
for O
something O
that O
was O
great O
in O
the O
same O
way O
as O
Nine O

and O
have B-Interests
fallen I-Interests
in I-Interests

with I-Interests
Street I-Interests
Sects. I-Interests
I O
like O
the O
anger O
and O
sadness O
that O
permeates O
all O
songs, O
and O
I O
really O
enjoy O
the O
raw O
sound O
which O
blends O
synthesizers O
with O
instruments O
and O
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
industrial O
genre O
but O
with O
a O
modern O
take. O
While O
the O
sound O
is O
raw O
and O
the O
vocals O
are O
often O
screaming, O
the O
songs O
often O
are O
quite O
melodic O
and O
varied O
and O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
progression. O
What O
else O

Edit: O
I O
have O
already O
explored O

but O
I O
felt O
that O
many O
of O
the O
songs O
sounded O
very O
similar, O
and O
I O
had O
hard O
time O
getting O
into O
it. O
They O
have O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
releases O
though, O
so O
I'd O
still O
be O
interested O
in O
recommendations O
of O
a O
good O
place O
to O
start. O
I O
have O
also O
tried O
HEALTH, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
vocals O
are O
too O
anonymous O
and O
monotone O
which O
is O
a O
damn O
shame, O
because O
the O
instrumentals O
are O
otherwise O
superb. O

Program O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
took O
inspiration O
from O
both O
Alex O
and O
Jeff O
in O
making O
the O
routine O
I O
laid O
out O
below. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
went O
with O
a O
torso O
/ O
limb O
split O
since O
that O
allowed O
me O
more O
easily O
to O
allocate O
the O
upper O
body O
volume. O
It's O
basically O
an O
upper O
/ O
lower O
split, O
just O
with O
arm O
work O
on O
leg O
days. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Some O
will O
notice O
the O
leg O
volume O
is O
a O
bit O
lacking, O
I O
started O
low O
on O
purpose, O
because O
I'm O
doing O
a O
bit O
of O
endurance O
work O
on O
the O
side. O
I O
bike O
60 O
minutes O
to O
and O
from O
work O
every O
day O
and O
I O
run O
4 O
times O
per O
week O
and O
hike O
in O
the O
weekend. O
Beyond O
that O
I O
think O
it's O
my O
upper O
body O
that O
needs O
the O
most O
work O
in O
either O
case. O

Thought O
you O
were O
a O
novice O
or O
something O
honestly O
from O
the O
piece O
of O
the O
pic O
shown O
above O
in O
the O
post, O
then O
I O
saw O
your O
lower O
body O
and O
other O
pics.. O
your O
calves O
are O
absolutely O
massive O
very O
impressive.. O
is O
it O
genetics, O
or O
do O
you O
have O
the O
best O
calve O
training O
routine O
in O
history? O
I’d O
love O
to O
know O
what O
you O
do O
for O
them, O
you O
seem O
to O
be O
lower O
body O
dominant O
so O
getting O
yoked O
will O
truly O
round O
you O
out O
imo O
[SEP]
Program O
looks O
solid O
bro, O
run O
it O
and O
keep O
us O
posted O
with O
your O
progress! O
[SEP]
Your O
legs O
are O
looking O
good, O
so O
is O
your O
arms O
and O
delts. O
Middle O
back O
is O
ok O
but O
your O
chest O
and O
lats O
are O
lacking. O
What O
grip O
do O
you O
do O
your O
pull O
ups O
with? O
It O
could O
also O
be O
a O
form O
issue O
for O
why O
you're O
not O
developing O
those O
areas O
more. O
Are O
you O
using O
full O
ROM O
and O
getting O
a O
nice O
stretch O
on O
the O
pull O
ups O
and O
chest O
exercises? O
[SEP]
Your O
frequency O
isn't O
really O
mentioned, O
so O
I'll O
say O
this. O
Arguably O
the O
two O
most O
important O
muscle O
groups O
for O
developing O
the O
"yoked" O
look O
are O
the O
shoulders O
and O
upper O
back. O
Shoulders O
are O
definitely O
emphasized O
in O
your O
program, O
but O
due O
to O
how O
quickly O
shoulders O
recover, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
variables O
in O
training O
them O
is O
going O
to O
be O
frequency. O
Finding O
ways O
to O
increase O
delt O
frequency O
without O
compromising O
joint O
health O
can O
be O
key. O
For O
most O
guys, O
the O
upper O
back O
seems O
to O
be O
able O
to O
handle O
even O
more O
volume O
and O
frequency O
than O
even O
the O
shoulders, O
so O
(and O
again O
being O
mindful O
of O
joint O
health) O
it's O
super O
difficult O
to O
overtrain O
your O
upper O
back, O
and O
if O
we O
want O
it O
to O
grow O
maximally O
we O
should O
probably O
be O
training O
it O
with O
greater O
volume O
and O
frequency O
than O
most O
other O
bodyparts. O
I O
could O
give O
you O
some O
suggestions O
in O
this O
area O
from O
my O
own O
experience O
if O
you'd O
like. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
One O
thing O
I O
noticed O
looking O
at O
your O
pictures O
is O
that O
while O
your O
shoulders O
and O
arms O
do O
look O
pretty O
well O
developed O
already, O
your O
chest O
may O
be O
considered O
a O
weakpoint. O
The O
program O
you've O
written O
disproportionately O
focuses O
on O
upper O
chest O
and O
shoulders, O
but O
seems O
to O
neglect O
the O
greater O
portions O
of O
the O
chest O
which O
for O
most O
people O
are O
more O
receptive O
to O
growth. O
This O
shouldn't O
necessarily O
be O
a O
concern O
depending O
on O
the O
physique O
you're O
going O
for, O
but O
a O
big O
part O
of O
getting O
that O
thick, O
girthy O
look O
is O
developing O
a O
chest O
that O
projects O
away O
from O
your O
body, O
and O
this O
will O
be O
almost O
entirely O
lower O
and O
mid O
pec. O
Again, O
this O
is O
just O
goal O
specific O
so O
feel O
free O
to O
ignore O
[SEP]
Physique O
wise O
I'd O
say O
lats, O
rear O
delts, O
lower O
back, O
and O
neck O
could O
be O
better. O
Chest O
seems O
decent O
but O
you O
can O
never O
have O
too O
big O
of O
a O
chest O
imo. O

Either O
I'm O

my O

or O
my O

I've O

I O
don't O
know O
what O
to O
say O
about O
my O
calves, O
I B-Appearance
guess I-Appearance
being I-Appearance
obese I-Appearance
for B-Time
all I-Time
of I-Time
my I-Time
youth I-Time
helped O
a O
ton O
:D O
Nowadays O
I O
mostly O
run O
and O
skip O
rope, O
but O
that O
can O
still O
give O
a O
good O
burn O
in O
the O
calves O
every O
now O
and O
then. O
[SEP]
I O
vary O
the O
grips O
every O
now O
and O
then. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Last O
8 O
weeks O
were O
chin O
ups O
and O
wide O
grip O
pull O
ups, O
this O
cycle O
it's O
supinated O
pull O
ups O
and O
normal O
grip O
pull O
ups. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don't O
record O
the O
pull O
ups O
that O
often, O
but O
I O
did O
it O
yesterday O
after O
seeing O
this. O
So O
my O
supinated O
form O
looks O
like O
this: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
https://youtube.com/shorts/KtFmdz3J3JQ O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
try O
to O
get O
full O
ROM O
on O
all O
exercises, O
like O
letting O
rows O
and O
pull O
ups O
reach O
the O
bottom O
and O
stretch O
and O
let O
the O
bar O
/ O
dumbbells O
touch O
my O
chest O
when O
benching. O
[SEP]
It's O
a O
ULUL. O
So O
triceps, O
for O
instance, O
are O
getting O
hit O
4 O
times O
per O
week. O
[SEP]
The O
frequency O
is O
essentially O
2x O
for O
most O
muscles O
except O
arms O
that O
is O
4x. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
taking O
your O
points O
about O
frequency O
and O
work O
capacity O
for O
some O
muscles O
to O
heart O
though, O
I O
might O
reconsider O
what O
muscles O
I O
want O
/ O
need O
to O
focus O
on. O
[SEP]
Think O
I O
might O
just O
look O
into O
the O
RP O
Chest O
and O
Back O
specialization O
program O
or O
something O
similar O
now O
that O
all O
agree O
on O
those O
weakpoints! O
[SEP]
Rom O
is O
looking O
good. O
But O
do O
a O
slightly O
narrower O
grip O
to O
target O
the O
lats O
more. O
The O
lats O
get O
better O
leverage O
when O
the O
upper O
arm O
is O
closer O
to O
the O
ribs. O
[SEP]
It's O
not O
an O
upper O
lower O
split, O
but O
there O
are O
also O
upper O
lower O
splits O
with O
A O
and O
B O
days O
which O
have O
different O
frequencies O
[SEP]
Yeah O
that O
sounds O
good,, O
you O
have O
quite O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
the O
"yoked" O
physique O
covered O
already O
and O
you O
look O
good. O
I O
think O
you'll O
get O
there O
man, O
good O
luck O
on O
your O
journey! O
[SEP]
Cheers, O
I O
ended O
with O
this O
grip O
as O
a O
narrower O
grip O
gave O
me O
some O
elbow O
pain, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
about O
getting O
used O
to O
the O
exercise. O
[SEP]
It's O
upper- O
or O
lower- O
weighted. O
You'll O
notice O
squats O
& O
deadliftss O
(lower O
day). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
there's O
not O
big O
upper O
body O
compounds O
on O
this O
day, O
just O
bi-tri O
isolations. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
point O
is O

get O
it O
4 O
times O

university’s O
baseball O
coach. O
I O
might O
end O
up O
playing. O
I O
remember O
you O
got O
upset O
at O
me O
for O
choosing O
you O
over O
sports. O
It’s O
okay; O
I O
was O
happier O
with O
you. O

Mentally, O
I’ve O
been O
doing O
well. O
Therapy O
has O
been O
going O
good. O
Been O
working O
on O
my O
communication, O
especially O
with O
how O
to O
notice O
my O
temper O
or O
my O
impatience O
and O
take O
steps O
back O
to O
just O
breathe O
and O
assess O
situations. O
I O
haven’t O
been O
road O
raging, O
I O
know O
it’s O
a O
miracle O
right? O
Even O
in O
COD, O
I O
still O
play O
CW O
by O
myself O
sometimes. O
Haven’t O
been O
getting O
mad. O
The O
guys O
and O
girls O
have O
been O
wondering O
about O
you, O
since O
you O
haven’t O
been O
speaking O
to O
any O
of O
us O
at O
all O
lately. O
A O
told O
me O
she O
tried O
reaching O
out O
to O
you O
but O
you O
were O
too O
busy. O
They O
were O
a O
bit O
blindsided O
by O
everything O
because O
we O
were O
your O
best O
friends. O
We O
miss O
you, O
miss O
you O
playing O
with O
us, O
the O
car O
rides O
picking O
you O
up O
from O
work, O
getting O
boba, O
KBBQ, O
shoot O
even O
the O
occasional O
beers O
and O
wings. O
Everyone O
is O
wondering O
how O
you’re O
doing, O
and O
no O
they O
didn’t O
pick O
my O
side. O
I O
wanted O
everyone O
to O
be O
neutral O
no O
matter O
how O
close O
you O
thought O
they O
were O
to O
me. O
A O
and O
A O
are O
your O
friends, O
they O
wish O
you’d O
be O
around O
more. O
[SEP]

Oh, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
boba O
spot O
we O
tried O
before O
you O
left. O
The O
one O
on O
San O
Pedro, O
when O
even O
though O
we O
were O
in O
the O
process O
of O
breaking O
up, O
you O
were O
feeding O
me O
the O
Korean O
corn O
dogs O
while O
I O
was O
driving. O
I O
went O
by O
the O
park O
we O
used O
to O
bring O
Pepper O
to, O
just O
to O
shoot O
around O
a O
bit. O
Ran O
into O
some O
of O
the O
other O
dogs O
there. O
How O
has O
Pepper O
been? O
Your O
mom O
hasn’t O
updated O
me O
about O
him. O
I’m O
surprised O
actually, O
considering O
she O
still O
checks O
up O
on O
me. O
I O
hope O
he’s O
not O
too O
depressed, O
he O
was O
really O
unhealthy O
looking O
during O
the O
entire O
breakup O
process. O
I O
hope O
he’s O
been O
getting O
out O
of O
the O
house. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Not O
sure O
if O
you O
saw O
on O
my O
brother’s O
snap O
or O
the O
other O
guy’s O
snaps, O
but O
I O
finally O
got O
that O
other O
piercing O
I O
was O
always O
talking O
about. O
For O
whatever O
reason O
I O
never O
got O
it O
until O
last O
month. O
I O
also O
started O
drafting O
that O
sleeve O
tattoo, O
my O
arms O
got O
a O
bit O
bigger O
so O
I O
was O
thinking O
maybe O
I’ll O
go O
with O
it. O
It’s O
hard O
to O
decide O
on O
what O
tribal O
style O
to O
get, O
and O
what O
baybayin O
script O
to O
put. O
Man O
it’s O
so O
fun O
but O
hard O
to O
decide! O
Switched O
my O
style O
up O
a O
bit, O
was O
getting O
tired O
of O
looking O
really O
bummy O
wearing O
shorts O
and O
hoodies O
all O
the O
time. O
I O
mean O
it O
didn’t O
change O
much, O
but O
I O
got O
a O
bunch O
of O
sweaters O
and O
crew O
necks O
I O
can O
wear O
out. O
I O
think O
you’d O
like O
some O
lol. O
That O
reminds O
me, O
you O
never O
gave O
me O
back O
my O
stuff. O
I O
have O
like O
a O
crap O
ton O
of O
stuff O
there. O
My O
spare O
glasses O
too! O
You O
mentioned O
it O
early O
on O
that O
you’d O
give O
my O
stuff O
back, O
but O
it’s O
been O
like O
7 O
weeks O
since O
then. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Idk O
if O
you’d O
be O
happy O
to O
hear O
this O
or O
not, O
but O
I O
started O
talking O
to O
an O
old O
high O
school O
crush O
and O
went O
on O
a O
couple O
dates. O
Sadly, O
I O
had O
to O
tell O
her O
the O
truth: O
I O
wasn’t O
ready O
to O
move O
forward O
with O
anything. O
I O
wasn’t O
ready O
to O
fully O
commit O
myself O
and O
my O
love O
into O
a O
new O
relationship. O
I O
wouldn’t O
have O
been O
my O
best O
for O
her. O
I O
know O
now O
that O
I’m O
just O
not O
ready O
to O
love O
someone O
else, O
I’m O
still O
working O
on O
myself. O
I O
remember O
how O
you O
didn’t O
like O
when O
I O
got O
attention O
from O
girls. O
It O
was O
always O
a O
cute O
thing O
when O
you O
got O
mad. O
I O
know, O
I O
know, O
I O
shouldn’t O
tease O
about O
it. O
You O
were O
the O
only O
one O
for O
me O
before, O
and O
until O
I O
find O
that O
next O
one, O
you’ll O
still O
have O
a O
place O
in O
my O
heart. O
Now O
I O
understand O
all O
those O
songs O
like O
“My O
Boo” O
and O
stuff. O
It’s O
crazy, O
I’ve O
been O
in O
tons O
of O
relationships O
and O
other O
stuff, O
but O
nothing O
ever O
hurt O
like O
this. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Anyway, O
I O
hope O
you’ve O
been O
taking O
care O
of O
yourself. O
Toward O
the O
end O
of O
the O
relationship, O
you O
weren’t O
doing O
much O
for O
yourself O
aside O
from O
gaming. O
Have O
you O
been O
keeping O
up O
with O
your O
homework O
okay? O
I O
remember O
I O
was O
helping O
you O
with O
some O
of O
your O
business O
assignments O
and O
accounting O
papers. O
I O
wish O
you O
got O
out O
more. O
Just O
take O
care O
of O
yourself O
please. O
I O
know O
you’ve O
been O
home O
from O
the O
Philippines O
for O
about O
a O
week O
now. O
I’m O
glad O
I O
haven’t O
had O
to O
run O
into O
you O
around O
the O
city, O
would’ve O
been O
awkward. O
I O
plan O
on O
meeting O
up O
with O
your O
mom O
when O
she O
gets O
back O
too, O
I O
have O
presents O
from O
my O
family O
to O
you O
and O
yours. O
I O
won’t O
be O
giving O
you O
any O
sadly. O
That’s O
his O
job O
now. O

I O

I O

[SEP]
To O

with, O
I O
am O
\[18M\] B-Age_Gender
and O
is O
quite O
the O
outgoing O
social O
type O
of O

Recently O
this O
college, O
I've O
had O
a O
friend O
whom O
I'll O
call O
King O
\[19M\] B-Age_Gender
have O
a O
crush O
on O
someone O
on O
our O
block, O
let's O
call O
her O
Anne O
\[18M\]. B-Age_Gender
Me O
being O
the O
outgoing O
social O

I O
offered O
to O
help O
King O
have O
a O
chance O
with O
Anne O
by O
first O
befriending O
Anne O
and O
then O
providing O
information O
about O
Anne's O
preferences O
and O
thoughts O
to O
King O
to O
help O
him O
understand O
her O
more. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Long O
story O
short, O
I O
was O
quite O
the O
social O
friendly O
out O
going O
guy O
so O
I've O
managed O
to O
befriend O
Anne O
to O
the O
point O
she's O
comfy O
to O
share O
her O
personal O
secrets O
to O
me. O
You O
could O
say O
I've O
managed O
to O
crack O
her O
guards O
down. O
Just O
to O
add O
Anne O
is O
quite O
the O
introverted O
shy O
person, O
she's O
quite O
secretive O
in O
which O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
King O
struggled O
to O
know O
her O
and O
accepted O
my O
offer O
of O
help. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
I've O
noticed O
that O
the O
longer O
I O
interacted O
with O
Anne O
I O
seem O
to O
have O
gain O
feelings O
for O
her, O
and O
it O
hurts O
me O
and O
my O
conscience O
every O
time O
I O
think O
of O
it; O
I O
feel O
quite O
scummy O
about O
having O
feelings O
for O
her O
as O
originally O
I O
only O
intended O
to O
help O
King O
set O
up O
with O
her. O
At O
first, O
it O
was O
subtle O
it O
was O
probably O
due O
to O
the O
trust O
Anne O
had O
in O
me O
for O
her O
to O
trust O
her O
personal O
secrets O
to O
me O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
warm, O
she's O
even O
quite O
pretty O
to O
speak O
of. O
Normally, O
we O
would O
walk O
together O
after O
college, O
since O
I'm O
the O
only O
guy O
she's O
quite O
comfy O
of O
but O
there O
was O
one O
instance O
where O
King O
and O
Anne O
was O
walking O
together. O
And O
I O
was O
at O
the O
back. O
I O
acted O
I O
supported O
King O
as O
I O
was O
openly O
supporting O
them O
due O
to O
my O
original O
intention O
at O
first O
to O
befriend O
Anne. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
was O
the O
moment, O
I O
realized O
I've O
gained O
feelings O
for O
Anne. O
I've O
never O
felt O
so O
self O
torn O
at O
that O
moment, O
I O
felt O
so O
jealous O
at O
King O
and O
so O
angry O
at O
myself O
for O
having O
feelings O
at O
Anne. O
I'm O
so O
angry O
and O
sad O
for O
why O
did O
I O
even O
fell O
for O
Anne. O
I've O
never O
felt O
so O
scummy O
ever O
before. O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
ruin O
my O
friendship O
with O
King O
just O
to O
have O
chance O
for O
Anne O
and O
I O
don't O
really O
want O
to O
tell O
Anne O
that O
I've O
gained O
feelings O
for O
her. O
I O
do O
not O
have O
any O
idea O
on O
what O
to O
do. O
I O
want O
this O
feeling O
to O
be O
gone O
but O
the O
more O
I O
push O
it O
away O
the O
stronger O
it O
comes O
to O
haunt O
me O
back. O
I O
genuinely O
hope O
for O
this O
feelings O
to O
be O
a O
quick O
happy O
crush O
but O
at O
this O
rate O
I'm O
despairing O
it O
won't O
just O
be O
a O
quick O
happy O
crush. O
I O
genuinely O
do O
want O
to O
ask O
your O
opinion O
on O
how O
should O
I O
proceed O
with O
this. O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
ruin O
my O
friendship O
with O
King O
nor O
do O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
Anne O
that O
I O
have O
feelings O
for O

I O
do O
want O
to O
get O
out O
of O
this O
situation O
but O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
if O
telling O
Anne O
that O
I O
have O
feelings O
for O
her O
is O
the O
only O
way O
out O
of O
the O
hole O
I've O

What O
you O
should O
do O
is O
tell O
King O
that O
you O
have O
feelings O
for O
Anne. O
Then O
decide O
what O
to O
do O
from O
there. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
still O
want O
to O
be O
friends O
with O
King O
then O
don't O
but O
if O
you O
don't O
care O
tell O
Anne O
you've O
been O
telling O
other O
people O
shit O
she O
shared O
with O
you O
and O
see O
how O
it O
works O
out O
[SEP]
Fuck O
king O
go O
for O
it O
[SEP]
I O
would O
rather O
tell O
Anne O
I O
have O
feelings O
for O
her O
than O
King. O
[SEP]
I O
haven't O
shared O
any O
personal O
secrets O
of O
Anne O
towards O
King. O
Actually O
before O
me O
and O
Anne O
got O
friends, O
I O
always O
asked O
her O
what O
she O
thought O
of O
King O
and O
I O
would O
always O
ask O
if O
King O
had O
a O
chance. O
I O
also O
did O
told O
her O
that O
I O
befriended O
her O
due O
to O
King O
and O
I'm O
thankful O
I O
did O
because O
I O
got O
to O
know O
her O
better. O
I O
also O
already O
told O
her O
that O
I O
would O
forward O
to O
king O
what O
Anne's O
preferences O
are O
but O
never O
her O
personal O
secrets. O
[SEP]
I O
am O
such O
a O
coward. O
For O
even O
doing O
this. O
I O
can O
see O
how O
much O
comfortable O
Anne O
is O
with O
me O
and O
it O
makes O
me O
feel O
so O
warm O
whenever O
I O
think O
of O
it. O
She O
used O
to O
sit O
alone O
or O
always O
sit O
randomly O
at O
our O
classes O
but O
now O
she O
always O
sits O
around O
next O
to O
me O
and O
I O
think O
it's O
sweet. O
But O
I O
can't O
just O
be O
a O
scummy O
bastard O
who O
steals O
his O
friend's O
crush. O
[SEP]
So O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
lose O
King O
as O
a O
friend? O
[SEP]
your O
feelings O
are O
a O
little O
inappropriate O
and O
disrespectful O
to O
King. O
is O
King O
even O
your O
friend? O
[SEP]
Shoot O
your O
shot, O
but O
don't O
expect O
king O
to O
stay O
friends O
even O
if O
he O
says O
he O
doesn't O
mind. O
[SEP]
Your O
friend O
is O
the O
coward O
and O
you O
would O
be O
betraying O
her, O
yourself O
and O
probably O
breaking O
her O
heart O
if O
you O
did O
nothing O
and O
left O
her O
to O
that O
idiot O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
know O
man O
King O
is O
quite O
also O
straightforward O
to O
her O
about O
his O
feelings O
its O
just O
that O
Anne O
isn't O
quite O
comfy O
with O
him. O
I O
really O
don't O
want O
to O
fuck O
up O
with O
King O
but O
if O
I O
have O
no O
other O
choice O
I'll O
probably O
talk O
it O
out O
with O
her O
it's O
just O
that O
I'm O
still O
hesitating. O
[SEP]
Just O
tell O
her O
how O
you O
feel, O
if O
she's O
into O
you O
just O
tell O
your O
friend O
you O
tried O
to O
set O
him O
up O
with O
a O
date O
and O
she O
said O
no O
because O
she O

Got O

at O
the O

for O

[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Yesterday O
I O
received O
an O
e-mail O
regarding O
the O
pre-sale O
that O
was O
promised O
by O
Abel O
and O
the O
XO O
team O
for O
previous O
ticket O
owners O
of O
the O
After O
Hours O
tour. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Back O
when O
the O
After O
Hours O
Till O
Dawn O
tour O
was O
announced, O
Abel O
put O
out O
an O
instagram O
post O
in O
which O
he O
explained O
the O
reasoning O
for O
cancelling O
the O
previous O
dates. O
He O
also O
stated O
that O
previous O
ticket O
owners O
would O
receive O
priority O
in O
buying O
tickets O
for O
new O
dates. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
yesterday O
I O
signed O
up O
for O
the O
pre-sale O
link. O
It O
stated O
that O
because O
I O
had O
bought O
tickets O
before O
I O
had O
early O
access O
to O
the O
tickets. O
But O
then O
I O
saw O
a O
TikTok O
add O
from O
Mojo O
(the O
promotor O
of O
the O
tour O
in O
the O
Netherlands), O
which O
stated O
that O
by O
clicking O
the O
link O
and O
signing O
up O
to O
their O
newsletter, O
subscribers O
would O
receive O
the O
link O
to O
the O
pre-sale O
as O
well. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
I O
asked O
my O
friend O
to O
do O
just O
that O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
people O
without O
previous O
tickets O
would O
also O
get O
access O
to O
the O
pre-sale. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
realized O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
hassle O
to O
get O
tickets O
since O
everyone O
had O
access O
to O
the O
pre-sale O
which O
was O
promised O
to O
only O
the O
previous O
ticket O
holders. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
today O
I O
didn’t O
manage O
to O
get O
the O
tickets O
I O
was O
promised O
and O
instead O
was O
waiting O
in O
a O
queue O
behind O
20.000 O
others O
(that O
is O
more O
than O
the O
capacity O
of O
the O
previous O
venue). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It’s O
safe O
to O
say O
I O
am O
deeply O
disappointed O
in O
the O
way O
this O
was O
handled O
and O
I O
honestly O
feel O
betrayed O
by O
the O
XO O
team O
and O
Abel. O
I O
don’t O
know O
how O
much O
they O
could’ve O
done O
about O
this O
and O
if O
this O
was O
truly O
their O
fault, O
but O
they O
failed O
to O
keep O
their O
promises O
and O
I O
am O
gutted. O

As B-Interests
a I-Interests
longtime I-Interests
XO I-Interests
fan I-Interests
this O
was O
my O
first O
time O
seeing O
Abel O
live O
and O
I O
was O
waiting O
in O
excitement O
since O
2020, O
but O
I O
honestly O
don’t O
feel O
like O
going O
through O
this O
process O
again O
tomorrow O
at O
the O
regular O
ticket O
sale. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
sorry O
for O
ranting O
on O
here, O
it O
just O
feels O
as O
though O
there O
is O
no O
real O
place O
to O
address O
this O
to O
the O
XO O
team O
other O
than O
to O
share O
my O
story O
with O
you O
guys. O

If O
anyone O
has O
experienced O
the O
same O
thing O
as O
me, O
then O
please O
let O
me O
know O
in O
the O
thread O
below! O
[SEP]
Bro O
I O
was O
in O
the O
queue O
behind O
22k O
people. O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
to O
the O
end O
they O
put O
me O
back O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
fucking O
queue O
[SEP]
For O
those O
who O
are O
from O
Amsterdam, O
maybe O
you O
could O
buy O
tickets O
for O
Brussels O
in O
Belgium. O
I O
got O
mine O
at O
the O
presales O
and O
I O
just O
checked O
now O
(15.41h) O
and O
there O
are O
still O
tickets O
left O
at O
the O
presale. O
[SEP]
Same O
thing O
happened O
to O
me O
mate. O
I O
even O
had O
3 O
tickets O
secured, O
transferred O
to O
my O
banking O
app O
to O
approve O
the O
payment, O
then O
after O
approving O
ticket O
master O
told O
me O
my O
details O
were O
incorrect. O
This O
happened O
for O
two O
different O
cards. O
I O
lost O
the O
tickets O
and O
now O
there O
aren't O
any O
left O
on O
pre-sale. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
had O
three O
tickets O
bought O
for O
the O
arena O
tour. O
We O
were O
told O
we'd O
be O
given O
priority O
for O
the O
stadium O
tour O
and O
we O
haven't O
been. O
That O
combined O
with O
less O
tour O
dates, O
and O
some O
countries O
that O
had O
dates O
now O
being O
omitted O
from O
the O
tour, O
really O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
the O
mouth. O
[SEP]
Yeah O
that O
priority O
shit O
was O
a O
giant O
scam O
by O
Ticketmaster. O
I O
received O
no O
emails O
about O
a O
presale O
and O
I O
just O
had O
to O
make O
a O
Live O
Nation O
account O
to O
have O
access O
to O
pre O
sale. O
I O
was O
fortunate O
that O
the O
European O
venues O
were O
easy O
to O
get O
tickets O
to, O
but O
its O
absolutely O
horrid O
what O
happened O
in O
UK O
and O
France. O
[SEP]
Contact O
a O
customer O
union, O
get O
info O
on O
your O
local/national O
laws. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Edit O
: O
TicketMaster O
don't O
give O
a O
shit, O
they O
don't O
even O
have O
a O
customer O
support O
in O
my O
country. O
[SEP]
TM O
scammed O
us O
all. O
Went O
through O
a O
20k O
line O
just O
to O
get O
placed O
back O
in O
line. O
Was O
lucky O
and O
tried O
my O
work O
phone O
and O
got O
through O
eventually. O
Paid O
a O
ton O
for O
those O
standing O
tickets O
man. O
Not O
to O
mention O
the O
pricing O
of O
the O
tickets O
in O
general O

What?? O
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 O
[SEP]
This O
is O
the O
exact O
same O
shit O
that O
happened O
with O
Taylor O
Swift O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago. O
Ticketmaster O
doesn’t O
give O
a O
fuck, O
they O
still O
get O
their O
money O
either O
way. O
[SEP]
same O
bro.. O
once O
i O
got O
through O
there O
were O
no O
tickets O
left O
its O
a O
joke O
[SEP]
Same O
here.. O
fucking O
stupid O
😭 O
[SEP]
Same O
[SEP]
also O
for O
those O
in O
Germany O
as O
well, O
try O
getting O
tickets O
to O
Prague. O
There O
are O
still O
places O
available. O
[SEP]
do O
you O
have O
a O
link O
to O
the O
presale O
perhaps? O
[SEP]
yeah.. O
i O
get O
the O
need O
to O
upscale O
to O
stadiums O
but O
the O
fact O
that O
previous O
ticket-holders O
were O
not O
given O
the O
priority O
as O
promised O
really O
hurts O
[SEP]
The O
same O
happened O
to O
me O
got O
denied O
three O
times O
and O
then O
was O
given O
a O
message O
saying O
my O
time O
was O
up, O
luckily O
it O
went O
through O
somehow O
so O
roll O

Wasn’t O
easy O
in O
the O

either O
:/ O
[SEP]
tbh O
don’t O
think O
i O
can O
do O
much, O
since O
we O
did O
get O
our O
tickets O
refunded O
back O
in O
the O
day, O
its O
just O
morally O
wrong O
thats O
all O
[SEP]
What O
a O
fucking O
lie O
that O
was. O
[SEP]
yeah O
happened O
to O
me O
for O
so O
many O
concerts O
🤣 O
[SEP]
true O
[SEP]
Are O
all O
the O
tickets O
gone O

[SEP]
I O
got O
tickets O
today O
during O

but O
the O

are O
not O
very O
good. O
Is O
it O
possible O
that O
I O
can O
get O
better O
seats O
tomorrow O
during O
the O
regular O
sale O
or O
are O
all O
the O
good O
seats O
sold O
during O
the O
presale O
[SEP]
not O
sure, O
i O
also O
don’t O
know O
what O
venue O
ur O
tickets O
are O
for. O
all O
i O
know O
is O
that O
the O
tickets O
being O
sold O
tomorrow O
for O
amsterdam O
are O
behind O
the O
stage O
:/ O
[SEP]
I O
dont O
think O
ticketmaster O
allows O
refunds, O
only O
ticket O
transfers/resale O
to O
other O
people O
[SEP]
Realky? O
How O
do O
you O
know? O
I O
bought O
tickets O
for O
Amsterdam O
today O
[SEP]
A O
resale O
is O
fine O
[SEP]
because O
mostly O
the O
front O
sections O
were O
sold O
during O
the O
pre.. O
but O
i O
might O
be O
wrong! O
[SEP]
They O
only O
have O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
seats O
available O
for O
presale. O
They’ll O
be O
more O
in O

My O
ex O
(27m) B-Age_Gender
and O
I O
(27f) B-Age_Gender
met O
because O
we O
both O
worked/studied O
at O
the O
same O
place. O
He O
had O
been O
there O
a O
lot O
longer O
than O
I O
had, O
everyone O
there O
knew O
him O
and O
loved O
him. O
I O
was O
new, O
and O
still O
making O
an O
impression. O
I O
knew O
I O
loved O
him O
the O
moment O
I O
saw O
him. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
started O
dating O
pretty O
quickly, O
and O
things O
were O
going O
well. O
But O
work O
started O
going O
downhill, O
I O
realised O
that O
one O
of O
my O
managers O
(33f) B-Age_Gender
felt O
competitive O
with O
me O
and O
essentially O
hated O
my O
guts O
for O
no O
reason. O
I O
found O
out O
later O
that O
she'd O
had O
a O
thing O
for O
my O
ex. O
I O
tried O
a O
lot O
of O
mediation O
etc O
to O
get O
her O
to O
work O
with O
me O
in O
a O
civil O
manner, O
but O
that O
ended O
in O
a O
screaming O
match O
with O
her O
yelling O
at O
me O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
hallway O
at O
work. O
This O
happened O
about O
a O
year O
into O
working O
there. O
When O
I O
tried O
to O
seek O
support O
from O
other O
managers O
(37m/55m), B-Age_Gender
I O
was O
told O
that O
I O
was O
being O
selfish, O
two-faced O
and O
money O
driven. O
My O
relationship O
came O
up O
as O
being O
something O
that O
was O
apparently O
distracting O
me O
from O
work. O
I O
was O
incredibly O
damaged O
after O
this O
and O
I O
don't O
think O
I O
processed O
it O
as O
the O
pandemic O
had O
just O
started. O
[SEP]
My O
ex O
and O
I O
moved O
in O
together O
around O
this O
time. O
He O
is O
very O
close O
with O
his O
family O
and O
over O
time O
he O
told O
me O
they O
were O
my O
family O
too. O
For O
context, O
I B-Family
have I-Family
no I-Family
family I-Family
in I-Family
the I-Family
country I-Family
where I-Family
I I-Family
work I-Family
and O
a O
fairly O
small O
friend O
circle. O
He O
became O
my O
world, O
and O
I O
did O
any O
and O
every O
thing O
for O
him O
and O
his O
family. O
I O
could O
feel O
myself O
losing O
bits O
of O
me, O
but O
it O
felt O
easier O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
relationship, O
rather O
than O
deal O
with O
the O
reality O
of O
my O
managers O
at O
work. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
did O
tell O
me O
quite O
early O
on O
into O
moving O
in O
together O
that O
it O
was O
stressful O
for O
him O
to O
be O
around O
me O
because O
I B-Mental_Health
was I-Mental_Health
sad I-Mental_Health
and I-Mental_Health
depressed I-Mental_Health
about I-Mental_Health
work I-Mental_Health
a I-Mental_Health
lot I-Mental_Health
of I-Mental_Health
the I-Mental_Health
time, I-Mental_Health
and O
he O
tried O
to O
leave O
me O
a O
month O
into O
moving O
in O
together. O
(He O
came O
back O
the O
next O
morning O
and O
apologised O
profusely) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
we O
stayed O
together O
for O
2.5 O
years O
after O
moving O
in O
together. O
Yes O
we O
had O
fights O
and O
he O
often O
said O
he O
needed O
space, O
but O
I O
thought O
we O
were O
working O
through O
it. O
He O
kept O
wanting O
me O
to O
be O
around O
his O
family, O
and O
I O
was O
okay O
with O
it, O
even O
though O
at O
times O
I O
felt O
they O
could O
be O
very O
overbearing. O
They O
often O
made O
jokes O
that O
would O
trigger O
my O
anxiety, O
and O
this O
was O
aggravated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
i O
hadnt O
been O
able O
to O
see O
my O
family O
for O
over O
2 O
years O
because O
of O
the O
pandemic. O
His O
family O
became O
my O
family, O
i O
baked O
cakes O
at O
all O
of O
their O
birthdays O
and O
i O
always O
got O
presents O
for O
all O
extended O
family O
members O
at O
Christmas. O
We O
often O
talked O
about O
marriage O
and O
children, O
even O
though O
he O
initially O
said O
he O
didn't O
believe O
in O
it, O
he O
said O
he O
could O
picture O
that O
future O
with O
me. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Earlier O
this O
year, O
I O
got O
a O
new O
part O
time O
job O
that O
I O
really O
loved. O
But O
over O
time, O
I O
realised O
I O
didn't O
fit O
into O
his O
world O
anymore. O
I O
could O
feel O
us O
growing O
distant O
as O
we O
were O
no O
longer O
working O
together, O
and O
he O
wasn't O
very O
supportive O
of O
my O
new O
job. O
Around O
this O
time, O
I O
realised O
how O
much O
the O
incident O
with O
my O
manager O
had O
affected O
me, O
and O
I O
started O
getting O
help. O
My O
ex O
was O
not O
very O
supportive O
of O
my O
mental O
health O
journey, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
because O
he O
had O
become O
numb O
to O
how O
anxious O
and O
depressed O
I O
always O
was. O
Our O
fights O
became O
more O
frequent, O
and O
his O
arguments O
became O
more O
personal O
as O
he O
would O
call O
me O
a O
terrible, O
rude O
person. O
I O
acknowledge O
my O
part O
in O
this O
as O
the O
smallest O
things O
would O
set O
me O
off, O
and O
I O
was O
getting O
angry O
and O
anxious O
at O
things O
that O
usually O
wouldn't O
bother O
me. O
But O
we O
still O
had O
our O
good O
times, O
we O
would O
still O
talk O
about O
our O
future O
together, O
and O
how O
things O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
once O
I O
was O
fully O
wrapped O
up O
at O
my O
old O
job O
and O
settled O
full O
time O
into O
my O
new O
one. O
[SEP]

Fast O
forward O
to O
two O
weeks O
ago, O
all O
my O
hard O
work O
of O
the O
year O
had O
culminated O
into O
a O
big O
week O
of O
events. O
I O
was O
very O
excited O
and O
hopeful O
for O
this O
week, O
as O
it O
was O
huge O
career O
wise O
for O
me. O
There O
was O
also O
going O
to O
be O
a O
party O
at O
my O
old O
work O
place- O
my O
ex's O
workplace O
at O
the O
end O
of O
that O
week O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
go O
and O
say O
goodbye O
to O
my O
old O
colleagues. O
We O
went O
out O
for O
his O
brother's O
birthday O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
that O
week O
and O
had O
a O
lovely O
time, O
I O
felt O
closer O
to O
my O
ex O
and O
his O
family O
than O
I O
have O
in O
a O
long O
time. O
On O
our O
walk O
home, O
my O
ex O
told O
me O
that O
he O
didn't O
want O
me O
to O
go O
to O
the O
party O
at O
his O
workplace O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
enjoy O
himself O
and O
not O
worry O
about O
me O
getting O
anxious. O
I O
was O
upset O
that O
he O
felt O
that O
way, O
and O
the O
fight O
escalated O
until O
he O
said O
he O
hated O
our O
relationship O
and O
didn't O
want O
to O
be O
with O
me O
anymore. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
was O
very O
hurt, O
but O
I O
acknowledged O
his O
feelings O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
take O
our O
space. O
My O
work O
events O
were O
successful, O
but O
I O
couldn't O
enjoy O
them O
because O
I O
was O
so O
devastated. O
He O
moved O
out O
to O
his O
mom's O
house O
after O
that O
week, O
and O
we O
tried O
to O
stay O
in O
touch O
but O
he O
put O
zero O
effort O
into O
keeping O
the O
conversation O
up. O
We O
met O
up O
a O
week O
later O
and O
I O
asked O
what O
was O
going O
on. O
He O
told O
me O
that O
he O
was O
firm O
in O
not O
wanting O
a O
relationship, O
and O
he O
didn't O
love O
me O
the O
way O
he O
should. O
I O
asked O
if O
we O
could O
work O
on O
it O
together, O
and O
he O
said O
no, O
that O
he O
needed O
to O
not O
be O
in O
a O
relationship O
for O
at O
least O
a O
month. O
And O
then O
maybe O
we O
could O
talk O
next O
year. O
I O
slept O
on O
it, O
and O
decided O
that O
it O
was O
unfair O
of O
him O
to O
leave O
me O
hanging O
for O
that O
long. O
I O
asked O
him O
to O
move O
all O
of O
his O
stuff O
out O
and O
I O
haven't O
seen O
him O
since. O
Ive O
said O
a O
lot O
of O
terrible O
things O
out O
of O
anger, O
asked O
to O
go O
NC O
and O
I O
fear O
that O
I've O
ruined O
any O
chances O
of O
reconciliation. O
It's O
been O
a O
week, O
and O
I O
still O
can't O
stop O
crying. O
The O
more O
time O
that O
passes, O
the O
more O
I O
realise O
how O
little O
he O
cared/loved O
me. O
I O
keep O
wishing O
he'll O
text, O
but O
he O
hasn't. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
so O
hurt O
and O
devastated O
that O
it O
ended O
this O
way O
after O
3.5 O
years. O
I O
was O
so O
close O
to O
him O
and O
his O
family, O
and O
I O
feel O
like O
I'm O
losing O
a O
whole O
family O
along O
with O
this O
relationship. O
It's O
his O
birthday O
in O
a O
few O
days O
and O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
I O
should O
wish O
him. O
I O
feel O
so O
hurt O
and O
lost. O
I O
still O
haven't O
recovered O
from O
my O
workplace O
incident O
and O
I O
just O
don't O
know O
if O
I'll O
ever O
be O
okay O
again. O
Part O
of O
me O
wonders O
if O
he O
lost O
love O
and O
respect O
for O
me O
because O
I O
couldn't O
cut O
it O
at O
his O
workplace. O
Feeling O
really O
devastated O
and O
heartbroken- O
I O
gave O
this O
relationship O
my O
all O
when O
I O
had O
so O
little O
to O
give, O
and O
my O
anxiety O
has O
been O
at O
an O
all O
time O
high. O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
he O
even O
misses O
me. O
I O
keep O
blaming O
myself O
for O
the O
breakup O
and O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
to O
stop. O
Sorry O
about O
the O
long O
post, O
I O
just O
needed O
to O
get O
this O
out O

asked O
me O
to O
have O
it O
printed O
24 O
X O
30 O
on O
aluminum. O
I O
delivered O
it. O
He O
opened O
it O

noticed O
a O
couple O
places O
where O
there O
was O
black O
on O
the O

He O
said O
something O

I O
showed O
him O
that O
those O

were O
black O

the O
original O
but O
told O
him O
that O
I O
could O
edit O

I O
told O
him, O

that O
I O
want O
him O

be O
happy O
hanging O

that O
I O
would O

He O
returned O
the O

that O
he O
was O

[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
edited O
the O
piece, O
got O
his O
approval O
and O
sent O
out O
for O
a O
reprint. O
I O
sold O
the O
piece O
for O
$325. O
The O
two O
prints O
together O
will O
cost O
me O
more O

that. O
So, O
last O

I O
sent O
him O
a O

asked O

he'd O
pitch O

He O

make O

[SEP]
If O
the O
piece O
was O
$325 O
and O
the O

costs O
$100, O
you O
should O
have O
told O
the O

“listen, O
here’s O
what O
we’ll O
do. O
A O
reprint O
will O
cost O
$200. O
I’ll O
split O

[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
would O
sound O
like O

[SEP]
Honestly, O
you O
can't O
change O
your O
mind O
on O
the O
price O
after O
the O
fact. O
If O
that O

situation O
were O

happen O
in O

you O
should O

proof O

before O
you O
print O
& O
charge O
more O
for O
the O
reprint O
post O
proof O
approval O
because O
it's O
custom O
work. O
I O
understand O
reprints O
if O
the O
printer O
is O
faulty, O
but O
to O
replace O
a O
perfectly O
good O
piece O
is O
admitting O
fault O
where O
there O
is O
none. O
[SEP]
Thanks O
everyone. O
He O
offered O
to O
chip O
in O
an O
extra O
$50 O
and O
I O
told O
him O
that O
I'd O
stick O
to O
my O
original O
offer. O
The O
prints O
are O
almost O
$200 O
each, O
so O
I'll O
lose O
a O
bit O
on O
this O
sale. O
I'm O
just O
going O
to O
chalk O
it O
up O

a O
learning O
experience. O
[SEP]
You O
can't O
change O
the O
price O
after O
you've O
already O
sent O
out O
the O
piece. O
That's O
very O
odd O
and O
unprofessional. O
Not O
making O
a O
reprint, O
or O
asking O
money O
for O
it O
ahead O
of O
time, O
would O
have O
been O
reasonable. O
But O
once O
you O
agreed O
to O
it, O
you O
can't O
really O
change O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Maybe O
you O
can O
sell O
the O
original O
print O
to O
someone O
else O
and O
recoup O
some O
of O
the O
money O
that O
way? O
Assuming O
the O
customer O
doesn't O
agree O
to O
pay O
your O
new O
price. O

Don't O
edit O
your O
shit O

the O
fact O

All O
sales O
are O

[SEP]
It O
depends. O
If O
the O
customer O
got O
something O
other O
than O
what O
they O
purchased, O
I O
try O
to O
examine O
what O
happened O
and O
eat O
the O
screwup. O
It O
has O
happened O
maybe O
3 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
5 O
years. O
If O
a O

got O
something O

I O
do O
nothing O

it. O

I O
had O
about O
10-11 O
years O

was O
a O
guy O
who O
wanted O
to O
buy O
five O
giclee O
prints O
from O
me. O
Big O
order, O
but O
I O
have O
done O
it O
before. O
He O
wanted O
to O
show O
them O
to O
his O
wife, O
have O
her O
pick O
out O
one, O
and O
then O
return O
the O
other O
4 O
and O
have O
me O
refund O
him O
his O
money. O
I O
told O
him O
these O
were O
all O
print O
to O
order O
and O
my O
business O
policy O
(which O
is O
stated O
on O
my O
website) O
is O
that O
I O
do O
not O
return O
prints O
that O
are O
not O
defective O
(and O
uhhh, O
if O
I O
delivery O
the O
prints O
and O
they O
look O
fine, O
and O
you O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
defective, O
we O
are O
both O
going O
to O
know O
you O
are O
lying). O

He O
responded O
with O
"Well O
you O
know, O
at O
Costco O
you O
can O
return O
stuff, O
I O
don't O
see O
how O
this O
is O
any O
different". O
I O
told O
him O
this O
isn't O
Costco, O
I B-Occupation
am I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
small I-Occupation
business, I-Occupation
I O
do O
not O
have O
warehouses O
for O
inventory, O
he O
wanted O
stuff O
that O
i O
would O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
and O
then O
deal O
with. O
I O
asked O
him O
to O
show O
his O
wife O
pictures O
and O
then O
ask O
which O
one O
she O
wants O
"I O
want O
it O
to O
be O
a O
surprise O
for O
her!, O
you O
know, O
something O
nice". O
I O
explained O
that O
it O
was O
more O
or O
less O
me O
doing O
something O
for O
his O
wife O
as O
I O
would O
have O
to O
eat O
the O
cost. O
These O
were O
people O
who O
were O
probably O
55-60 O
at O
the O
time. O
His O
wife O
is O
an O

She O
can O

which O
one O
she O
wants O
on O
the O

The O

I O

the O
picture. O
Everyone O
loves O
the O
art, O
but O
the O
manager O
wanted O
to O
make O
some O
color O
alterations. O
I O
am O
convinced O
they O
did O
so O
because O
they O
are O
a O
task O
master O
(look O
up O
the O
Bullshit O
Jobs O

for O
the O

Master) O
and O
need O
to O
have O
their O
hands O
on O
everything, O
even O
things O
which O
do O
not O

require O
management. O
His O
job O
wasn't O
to O
make O
sure O
things O
look O
good, O
his O
job O
was O
to O
add O
steps O

it O

it, O
thats O
on O
them. O
Its O
my O
job O
to O
deliver O
what O
they O
ordered, O
not O
to O
cater O
to O
their O
every O
need. O
[SEP]
I O
hate O
to O
say O
it, O
but O
I O
agree, O
you O
can't O
go O
back O
on O
your O
offer. O
That O
said, O
I O
wouldn't O
feel O
too O
bad O
about O
asking, O
they O
might O
have O
been O
happy O
to O
do O
it O
and O
it O
all O
would O
have O
worked. O
You O
could O
now O
recover O
by O
writing O
back O
and O
saying O
after O
you O
had O
a O
minute O
to O
think O
on O
it O
you O
feel O
bad O
about O
asking O
and O
want O
to O
continue O
with O
your O
original O
agreement. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
then O
you O
can O
chalk O
this O
up O
to O
the O
cost O
of O
education. O
Some O
people O
pay O
thousands O
to O
go O
to O
college, O
this O
was O
one O
of O
your O
lessons. O
In O
future O
you'll O
do O
things O
a O
little O
different. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Congrats O
on O
the O
sale! O
[SEP]
Yeah O
I O
have O
had O
this O
happen O
time O
and O
time O
again. O
Sometimes O
I O
worked O
for O
like O
2.5$ O
an O
hour O
if O
you O
count O
it, O
because O
I O
would O
take O
on O
a O
huge O
project O
for O
like O
400$ O
but O
then O
spend O
an O
eternity O
finishing O
the O
piece O
and O
then O
the O
client O
would O
ask O
for O
a O
revision. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Always O
makes O
me... O
aggravated. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
I O
bumped O
up O
the O
prices. O
You O
never O
know O
how O
the O
job O
will O
go O
or O
who O
the O
client O
is O
as O
an O
individual. O
Being O
an O
artist O
is O
a O
great O
journey O
- O
the O
career O
takes O
you O
for O
a O
friggin O
ride. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don't O
think O
any O
of O
the O
Disney O
animators O
thought O
they O
would O
work O
at O
Disney. O
[SEP]
Well, O
I O
wouldn’t O
have O
asked O
for O
payment O
after O
saying O
it O
wasn’t O
required, O
but O
since O
that O
is O
where O
you O
are, O
you O
could O
either O
A. O
Leave O
it O
and O
not O
message O
them O
again O
or O
B. O
Send O
them O
another O
message O
apologizing O
for O
asking O
for O
payment O
and O
telling O
them O
not O
to O
worry O
about O
it, O
you O
can O
try O
to O
make O
up O
something O
about O
extra O
fees O
you O
were O
charged O
that O
you O
didn’t O
expect O
or O
something O
but O
it’s O
a O
bad O
look O
to O
have O
asked O
for O
payment O
after O
saying O
it O
would O
be O
free. O
[SEP]
1. O
Make O
sure O
the O
customer O
has O
access O
to O
very O
clear O
images O
of O
the O
piece, O
from O
multiple O
angles O
if O
necessary O
to O
show O
what O
it O
looks O
like O
with O
light O
reflecting O
off O
of O
it O
if O
that O
makes O
a O
difference, O
which O
in O
this O
case, O
it O
seems O
like O
it O
might. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
2. O
If O
this O
isn’t O
a O
commissioned O
piece, O
don’t O
offer O
to O
edit O
it. O
The O
EXCEPTION O
would O
be O
if O
there’s O
a O
glaring O
issue O
that O
multiple O
customers O
are O
noticing O
and O
pointing O
out. O
The O
customer O
not O
liking O
the O
use O
of O
black O
on O
part O
of O
the O
image O
is O
an O
issue O
with O
the O
customer’s O
personal O
taste, O
and O
not O
your O
work. O
Don’t O
sacrifice O
integrity O
to O
make O
a O
sale. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
3. O
If O
you’ve O
already O
stated O
you’ll O
cover O
the O
cost, O
*cover O
the O
cost.* O
Do O
not O
ask O
a O
buyer O
for O
extra O
money O
after O
you’ve O
stated O
you’ll O
pay O
for O
a O
reprint. O
You’re O
just O
going O
to O
have O
to O
eat O
that O
loss O
at O
that O
point. O
If O
you O
weren’t O
sure O
how O
to O
handle O
this, O
you O
could’ve O
told O
the O
buyer O
“I’ll O
see O
what O
I O
can O
do, O
and O
get O
back O
to O
you.” O
Then O
take O
some O
time O
to O
think O
about O
how O
to O
handle O
the O
situation O
or O
ask O
for O
advice O
if O
needed. O
[SEP]
You O
cant O
ask O
for O
money O
from O
the O
client. O
You O
should O
always O
before O
printing O
get O
a O
client O
to O
sign O
a O
proof O
sheet. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
This O
way O
you O
are O
covered O
for O
this O
very O
situation. O
You'd O
of O
been O
able O
to O
show O
they O
approved O
the O
first O
print O
"as O
is". O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
you O
didn't O
do O
that O
and O
offered O
to O
edit O
and O
reprint O
at O
your O
own O
cost, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
just O
accept O
the O
loss. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
put O
the O
first O
print O
up O
for O
sale O
though O
if O
its O
not O
a O
photo O
of O
the O
client O
themselves O
or O
a O
person O
without O
a O
model O
release. O
[SEP]
It O
happens O
... O
an O
assumption O
of O
fees O
illustrates O
how O
critically O
important O
rates O
are. O
"Let O
me O
verify O
another O
copy O
fee O
and O
shipping O
and O
I'll O
get O
back O
to O
you." O
[SEP]
In O
the O
future O
, O
the O
price O
of O
your O
print O
should O
always O
be O
the O
cost O
x O
2.5. O
This O
allows O
for O
errors O
like O
this, O
while O
adding O
a O
little O
wiggle O
room O
to O
make O
a O
profit O
in O
this O
worse O
case O
scenario. O
[SEP]
Can O
you O
list O
it O
as O
ready O
to O
ship O
holiday O
offer O
and O
try O
to O
get O
a O
sale O
that O
way? O
[SEP]
I O
did O
pay O
thousands O
to O
go O
to O
college O
and O
business O
school O
to O
boot. O
I O
know O
better. O
I'm O
not O
thinking O
straight. O
[SEP]
He O
offered O
to O
kick O
in O
an O
extra O
$50 O
and O
I O
told O
him O
never O
mind. O
[SEP]
In O
fairness O
to O
myself, O
the O
customer O
saw O
the O
piece O
at O
an O
art O
show. O
He O
looked O
at O
it O
for O
a O
good O
ten O
minutes. O
He O
didn't O
take O
that O
physical O
piece O
only O
because O
I'd O
dropped O
it O
and O
there O
was O
chip O
on O
the O
edge O
where O
it O
hit O
the O
pavement O
and O
I O
insisted O
that O
he O
have O
an O
intact O
piece. O
[SEP]
The O
original O
one O
? O
[SEP]
so O
you O
flip O
flop O
on O
him, O
and O
then O
when O
he O
said O
yes, O
you O
flip O
flop O
again. O
and O
entire O
change O
was O
for O
customer O
who O
knew O
what O
they O
had. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
you O
gotta O
stop O
this, O
or O
you O
will O
never O
get O
off O
the O
ground O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
that O
would O
be O
odd, O
then, O
that O
he’d O
complain O
about O
the O
black O
color O
when O
he O
saw O
it O
up O
close O
and O
in O
person! O
[SEP]
I O
can O
try. O
I O
don't O
sell O
a O
ton O
of O
my O
work O
and O
have O
never O
sold O
anything O
online. O
[SEP]
You're O
right. O
I O
messed O
this O
one O
up. O
[SEP]
I O
mean O
you’ve O
got O
nothing O
to O
lose O
[SEP]
don't O
focus O
on O
what O
you O
did O
wrong. O
focus O
on O
what O
you O
did O
right. O
made O
a O

more O
about O
discipline. O
I O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
build O
a O
project O
for O
the O
last O
6 O
months O
but O
still O
don't O
put O
in O
enough O
time O
to O
finish O
it, O
in O
my O
case O
I'm O
just O
a O
lazy O
asshole. O
[SEP]
Have O
you O
thought O
of O
getting O
into O
pmo O
team? O
[SEP]
Hey, O
chill. O
Thats O
exactly O
how O
you O
learn O
and O
improve. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
fuck O
up, O
you O
figure O
out O
what O
went O
wrong, O
and O
see O
what O
can O
be O
improved. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
&#x200B; O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Once O
you O
are O
past O
a O
certain O
point, O
you O
will O
understand O
that O
fuck O
ups O
are O
pretty O
much O
expected, O
which O
is O
when O
you O
start O
pouring O
over O
observability O
and O
alerts. O
[SEP]
Thats O
the O
general O
life O
in O
tech, O
especially O
those O
that O
aren't O
really O
following O
waterfall O
and O
instead O
opting O
for O
agile O
or O
extreme. O

Beating O
yourself O
over O
issues O
that O
came O
up O
is O
absolutely O
wrong. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don't O
know O
your O
circumstances, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
for O
certain O
that O
it O
is O
never O
just O
your O
problem. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
code O
should O
have O
been O
reviewed O
and O
tested O
thoroughly. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
it O
wasn't O
or O
that O
is O
not O
the O
strategy O
your O
org O
uses, O
then O
its O
the O
fault O
of O
the O
management O
who O
have O
such O
a O
system O
in O
place. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
&#x200B; O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Just O
remember O
to O
learn O
from O
this O
[SEP]
[SEP]
&#x200B; O
[SEP]
[SEP]
1. O
Where O
and O
how O
did O
you O
and O
your O

mess O
up. O
[SEP]
2. O
How O
could O
you O
have O
caught O
such O
an O
issue O
earlier. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
&#x200B; O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Generally, O
after O
each O
project, O
its O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
jot O
down, O

what O

what O

blameless O
action-points O
using O
above O
strategy O
on O
improving. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
&#x200B; O
[SEP]
[SEP]
At O
the O
start, O
there O
might O
be O
quite O
a O
few O
in O
the O
didn't O
go O
well O
category, O
but O
over O
time O
if O
you O
learn, O
adapt O
and O
improve, O
then O
you'll O
find O
the O
problems O
in O
that O
list O
starts O
reducing O
and O
the O
problems O
that O
do O
come O
up O
are O
rare O
or O
really O
hard O
to O
catch. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
&#x200B; O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
keep O
improving O
and O
that O
the O
only O
way O
forward. O
[SEP]
>How O
do O
I O
get O
time O
to O
improve O
with O
10+ O
hour O
working O
everyday? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
There O
could O
be O
longer O
days O
and O
shorter O
days O
depending O
on O
the O
nature O
of O
work O
during O
those O
days. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
may O
be O
wrong, O
but O
from O
what O
I O
recollect, O
you O
are O
not O
familiar O
with O
this O
tool O
and O
that O
could O
probably O
be O
the O
reason O
why O
it O
takes O
10+ O
hours. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
your O
productivity O
is O
fine O
then O
u/raddiwallah O
is O
spot O
on O
[SEP]
I O
checked O
your O
profile O
seems O
like O
you O
have O
been O
struggling O
since O
many O
months. O
stop O
working! O
seriously. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
In O
my O
experience, O
companies O
don’t O
deliberately O
exploit O
people O
but O
people O
literally O
surrender O
and O
open O
their O
arms O
for O
exploitation. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
7 O
years O
in O
witch O
here, O
today O
I O
will O
watch O
topgun O
mavericks O
in O
office O
time, O
not O
bragging O
just O
to O
give O
you O
a O
reality O
check. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Its O
up O
to O
you O
if O
you O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
same O
situation O
or O
not. O
I O
have O
seen O
some O
folks O
stuck O
in O
similar O
situation O
since O
a O
decade. O
Yeah O
sure O
they O
can O
say O
manager O
is O
asshole O
but O
question O
is O
why O
couldn’t O
they O
just O
move O
on. O
I O
think O
they O
themselves O
don’t O
believe O
that O
there O
is O
any O
hope O
left. O
Please O
don’t O
be O
like O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can’t O
change O
things O
in O
your O
current O
project O
so O
its O
time O
to O
move O
on. O
And O
stop O
working, O
do O
bare O
minimum. O
Take O
leaves O
when O
you O
feel O
like O
it. O
Trust O
me O
your O
company O
wont O
do O
jack O
shit O
unless O
you O
literally O
commit O
a O
crime O
like O
data O
leak. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
should O
try O
to O
switch O
to O
other O
witch O
with O
minimum O
hike O
expectations O
so O
you O
can O
get O
an O
offer O
or O
go O
for O
any O
small O
company. O
And O
then O
just O
focus O
on O
interviews O
completely. O
Good O
luck. O
[SEP]
see O
the O
best O
way O
to O
not O
get O
in O
trouble O
is O
always O
informing O
stakeholders O
aboutt O
blockers O
[SEP]
[SEP]
a O

Better O
to O
not O
respond, O
and O
keep O
your O
sanity O
rather O
than O
keep O
wasting O
time O
for O
a O
manager/company O
that O
doesn't O
give O
two O
shits O
about O
you O
or O
the O
development O

Investing O
time O
in O
studying O

trying O
to O
switch O
would O
be O
much O
better. O
[SEP]
Working O
hours O
are O
generally O
9-6. O
Be O
responsive O
then. O
Outside O
of O
these O
hours O
they O
have O
no O
business O
demanding O
anything O
off O
you. O
[SEP]
they'll O
act O
like O
it's O
a O
big O
issue O
but O
they O
can't O
do O
shit O
if O
they're O
trying O
to O
contact O
you O
after O
work O
hours. O
especially O
freshers O
they O
try O
to O
take O
advantage O
since O
they're O
new O
to O
work O
culture O
and O
not O
seniors O
since O
they O
don't O
give O
a O
shit. O
also O
if O
you O
feel O
any O
meetings O
and O
working O
happens O
during O
personal O
time O
bring O
to O
manager. O
any O
half O
decent O
ones O
worth O
their O
salt O
will O
help O
you. O
[SEP]
Got O
it. O
Thanks. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
replying. O
[SEP]
To O
be O
honest, O
that's O
a O
very O
scary O
thing O
to O
do, O
to O
not O
respond O
even O
if O
it O
is O
after O

but O
I'll O

Anyway, O
yesterday O
I O
receive O
a O
phone O
call O
from O
a O
man O
who O
said O
he O
was O
from O
the O
umbrella O
company O
who O
worked O
with O
my O
agency O
and O
wanted O
to O
talk O
me O
through O
a O
couple O
of O
different O
methods O
of O
payment O
before O
my O
first O
wage O
comes O
through O
this O
Friday. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
proceeds O
to O
offer O
me O
two O
options, O
please O
bare O
in O
mind O
I O
am O
not O
clued O
on O
on O
tax O
so O
if O
this O
does O
not O
make O
much O
sense O
it O
may O
be O
because O
I O
have O
not O
remembered O
the O
info O
correctly. O
He O
tells O
me O
the O
first O
option O
and O
leads O
with O
the O
amount O
I’ll O
be O
getting O
paid O
which O
was O
around O
£1150 O
per O
week. O
At O
this O
point O
alarm O
bells O
are O
already O
ringing O
as O
it O
is O
significantly O
higher O
than O
what O
I O
have O
worked O
out O
I O
should O
be O
taking O
home O
myself. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
tells O
me O
all O
I O
need O
to O
do O
is O
put O
aside O
£72 O
per O
week O
and O
when O
HMRC O
come O
around O
in O
April O
I O
will O
pay O
them O
the O
money O
I’ve O
put O
aside O
and O
explained O
that O
this O
was O
just O
the O
accounting O
side O
of O
things O
(didn’t O
make O
sense O
to O
me O
but O
he O
carries O
on) O
he O
then O
says O
they O
will O
need O
to O
pay O
me O
into O
two O
separate O
bank O
accounts, O
one O
will O
have O
around O
750 O
paid O
into O
it O
and O
the O
other O
will O
have O
around O
350 O
paid O
into O
it O
and O
explained O
that O
1 O
of O
the O
payments O
is O
‘profit’ O
(I O
don’t O
understand O
what O
this O
means O
either?). O
He O
said O
if O
I O
choose O
this O
route O
they O
will O
send O
me O
a O
contract O
to O
sign O
- O
baring O
in O
mind O
I O
have O
already O
signed O
a O
contract O
when O
I O
first O
started O
with O
my O
agency. O
He O
also O
said O
I O
might O
prefer O
this O
route O
because O
I O
wouldn’t O
have O
to O
make O
any O
student O
loan O
contributions. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
then O
said O
that O
the O
second O
option O
entails O
me O
being O
paid O
into O
1 O
bank O
account O
and O
coming O
out O
with O
around O
£850 O
per O
week, O
my O
student O
loan O
contributions O
will O
be O
made O
and O
it O
is O
through O
a O
‘PAYE’ O
method. O
He O
also O
said O
I O
will O
also O
be O
optics O
into O
a O
pension O
scheme O
which O
I O
can O
opt O
out O
of. O
This O
option O
seemed O
far O
less O
complicated O
and O
aligned O
with O
what O
I O
had O
already O
pre-empted O
my O
pay O
to O
be. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
told O
him O
I O
would O
have O
a O
think O
and O
let O
him O
know O
what O
I O
would O
prefer O
in O
the O
morning. O
I O
have O
done O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
googling O
and O
have O
spent O
most O
of O
last O
night O
and O
this O
morning O
learning O
about O
umbrella O
companies O
and O
the O
horrendous O
loan O
charge O
scandal. O
From O
what O
I O
had O
learnt O
I O
felt O
option O
2 O
would O
be O
the O
legit O
way O
and O
rang O
him O
this O
morning O
to O
say O
I O
would O
like O
to O
take O
the O
lower O
amount O
and O
make O
my O
student O
loan O
contributions O
he O
said O
this O
was O
fine O
and O
was O
polite O
enough. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
first O
question O
is, O
is O
what O
they O
are O
offering O
illegal? O
My O
second O
is O
should O
I O
change O
umbrella O
companies O
completely? O
I’m O
fairly O
certain O
they O
are O
dodgy O
but O
I O
feel O
confident O
I O
have O
chosen O
the O
right O
option, O
I O
just O
don’t O
want O
to O
experience O
any O
trouble O
with O
HMRC O
later O
down O
the O
line O
from O
the O
collateral O
of O
any O
potential O
trouble O
my O
umbrella O
company O
might O
find O
themselves O
in. O
This O
is O
my O
first O
role O
outside O
of O
a O
perm O
contract O
and O
I B-Occupation
am I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
fairly I-Occupation
young I-Occupation
social I-Occupation
worker I-Occupation
(24) B-Age
this O
job O
is O
all O
I O
have O
ever O
done O
since O
graduating O
and O
I O
am O
passionate O
about O
it O
so O
do O
not O
want O
to O
do O
anything O
that O
might O
risk O
my O
career O
or O
future. O

Option O

would O

Its O
up O

if O
you O
want O

option O

are O
happy O

the O
amount O
I O

2. O

the O
contract O

2 O

actually O

you O
regardless O
of O
what O

says O

do O
this O
every O

regardless... O
HMRC O
have O
made O
it O
quite O
plain O
in O
the O
past O
that O
if O
they/you O
have O
been O
scammed O
out O
of O
your O
tax O
money O
they O
don't O
care O
and O
want O
it O
anyway O
from O
you O
pronto O
- O
with O
the O
dodgy O
options O
your O
being O
presented O
I O
would O
disengage O
from O
this O

immediately... O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
a O
side O
note O
I've O
used O
NASA O
in O
the O
past O
and O
they O
paid O
my O
taxes O
- O
notice O
I O
didn't O
say O
they O
were O
good... O
all O
umbrellas O
should O
really O
all O
be O
the O
same O
as O
you O
are O
essentially O
buying O
a O
payroll O
service O
thats O
it.. O
[SEP]
Option O
2, O
just O
make O
sure O
you're O
receiving O
your O
holiday O
pay O
and O
they're O
not O
skimming O
it O
off. O
[SEP]
Worthwhile O
staying O

[SEP]
OP, O
you've O
got O
your O
head O
screwed O
on O
just O
right. O
If O
an O
offer O
seems O
"too O
good O
to O
be O
true" O
then O
it O
usually O
is. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
the O
end O
client O
is O
in O
the O
public O
sector O
then O
I'd O
suggest O
letting O
them O
know. O
I O
am O
not O
clued O
up O
enough O
on O
tax O
to O
know O
what O
ruse O
the O
brolly O
is O
pulling, O
but O
it O
feel O
pretty O
shady. O
[SEP]
I O
hope O
I O
am O
not O
too O
late. O
Do O
not O
go O
with O
option O
one! O
An O
umbrella O
company O
that O
suggests O
paying O
money O
in O
2 O
different O
bank O
accounts O
smell O
really O
bad... O
period. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
is O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
Umbrella O
Companies O
don't O
have O
"a O
statutory O
definition" O
for O
HMRC. O
Therefore O
as O
long O
as O
HMRC O
is O
aware, O
an O
Umbrella O
Company O
is O
like O
a O
normal O
permanent O
employer. O
So O
it O
is O
different O
because O
you O
are O
now O
an O
agency O
worker O
but O
how O
you O
will O
be O
paid O
shouldn't. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
created O
this O
calculator O

you O

Umbrella O
Pay O
very O
accurately: O
[https://payslipbuddy.co.uk/umbrella-company-calculator](https://payslipbuddy.co.uk/umbrella-company-calculator) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
the O
money O
you O
receive O
is O
way O
higher O
than O
what O
was O
returned O
to O
the O
calculator, O
I O
would O
advise O
you O
to O
run. O
But O
anyway, O
based O
on O
what O
they O
suggested, O
I O
would O
leave O
them O
anyway. O
I O
can't O
see O
how O
option O
1 O
is O
not O
a O
DR O
Scheme. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
next O
thing O
you O
should O
do O
is O
create O
your O
tax O
account O
on O
the O
HMRC O
website. O
A O
few O
workers O
know O
this, O
but O
all O

can O
create O
a O

Ok? O
And O
you O
think O
posting O
here O
is O
a O
way O
to O
fix O
mental O
health? O
The O
problem O
is O
psychological O
and O
we O
aren’t O
experts O
on O
fixing O
your O
psychology. O
I O
have O
empathy O
for O
you, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
exactly O
you’re O
waiting O
for O
someone O
here O
to O
say O
that O
will O
help O
you O
like O
a O
beam O

from O
God O

If O
you’ve O
been O
seeing O
a O
therapist O
like O
you O
say O
you O
have, O
then O
that’s O
where O
you O
say O
these O
thoughts O
you O
have. O
If O
your O
therapist O
is O
a O
Muslim, O
you’ve O
got O
the O
wrong O
therapist. O
I O
really O
wish O
we O

you O

you’re O

how O
can O
we O

**Question** O
\- O
I O
must O
travel O
outside O

next O

I O
think O
exiting O
the O
Netherlands O
with O
my O
other O
non-EU O
passport O
should O
be O
ok O
- O
I O
don't O
think O
they O
care, O
but O
how O
does O
it O
work O
when O
I O
want O
to O
enter O
the O
country O
again? O
Can O
they O
decline O
my O
entry? O
*(I O
should O
note O
that O
I O
have O
never O
entered O
the O
EU O
with O
my O
non-EU O

so O
If O
I O
leave O
now, O
they O
will O
only O
see O
that O
somehow, O
I'm O
in O

now, O
trying O
to O
leave O
it O

no, O

idea O
to O
leave O
the O
country O
with O
a O
non-EU O

so O
I O
decided O
not O
to O
risk O
it. O
Missed O
a O
flight, O
spammed O
the O
embassy O
with O
calls O
until O
I O
got O
my O
EU O

back, O
and O
booked O
a O
new O
flight. O
(Spent O
a O
few O
hundreds O
extra O
in O
the O

gotta O
love O
these O
unplanned O
spendings O
:)). O
[SEP]
You O
will O
have O
have O
an O
issue O
leaving O
Netherlands O
as O
you O
do. O
not O
have O
an O
entry O
stamp O
in O
your O
Non O
EU O
passport. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
With O
Schengen O
zone O
as O
there O
is O
controlled O
entry O
ie O
everyone O
scanned O
in O
& O
out O
, O
it’s O
essential O
same O
passport O
is O
used O
. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
only O
had O
to O
leave O
once O
without O
same O
passport O
and O
we O
had O
a O
police O
report O
that O
the O
original O
passport O
that O
was O
used O
had O
gone O
missing. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Maybe O
if O
you O
show O
some O
documentation O
that O
passport O
is O
being O
kept O
for O
a O
visa O
( O
not O
sure O
if O
they O
will O
care O
) O
likely O
you O
could O
be O
detained O
for O
further O
questioning O
and O
possibly O
miss O
flight O
or O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
exit. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Get O
to O
airport O
early. O
Possibly O
call O
dutch O
immigration O
and O
ask O
what O
if O
anything O
can O
be O
done O
[SEP]
Contact O
your O
embassy O
for O
advice. O
Everyone O
here O
is O
trying O
to O
help O
but O
your O

might O
even O
be O
able O
to O
give O
you O
an O

resolve O

This O
is O

I've O
had O
the O

It O
has O
nothing O

two O

is O
actually O
very O
handy O
in O
this O

so O
you O
are O
never O
without O
one. O

Very O
true, O
it O
can O
be O
handy O
- O
and O
I O
don't O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
the O
fact O
they O
had O
to O
keep O
my O
passport. O
I O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
them O
being O
unprofessional O
- O
they O
said O
they O
need O
15 O
working O
days O
to O
process O
visa. O
Out O
of O
nowhere, O
they O
started O
making O
up O
some O
new O
rules O
and O
said O
it O
will O
be O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
instead O
and O
would O
not O
return O
any O
of O
my O
calls/emails O
since. O
[SEP]
Yes O
you O
can O
definitely O
do O
that. O
Problem O
is O
if O
you O
didn’t O
enter O
on O
it O
, O
and O
now O
need O
to O
leave O
& O
don’t O
have O
the O
EU O
one O
in O
hand O
or O
EU O
Id O
card O
to O
exit O
the O
schengen. O
Trust O
me O
the O
border O
guards O
are O
not O
happy O
when O
the O
entry O
and O
exit O
stamps O
don’t O
match O
up O
[SEP]
Please O
don't O
do O
this. O
Your O
original O
passport O
will O
be O
invalidated. O
You're O
better O
off O
going O
to O
the O
South O
African O
embassy, O
withdraw O
your O
visa O
application O
and O
retrieve O
your O
passport. O
[SEP]
Usually O
we O
don’t O
plan O
travel O
using O
a O
passport O
that’s O
being O
sent O
for O
a O
visa. O
[SEP]

Has O
happened O
to O
me, O
i’m B-Race_Nationality
british I-Race_Nationality
and O
will O
almost O
always O
enter O
Uk O
on O
my O
british O
one O
, O
but O
have O
a O
second O
one O
so O
if O
one O
is O
getting O
a O
visa O
I B-Race_Nationality
use I-Race_Nationality
my I-Race_Nationality

to O
enter O

I O
knew O
they O
will O
take O
my O
passport O
so O
I O
planned O
my O
travels O
accordingly. O
However, O
I O
did O
not O
anticipate O
the O
embassy O
would O
close O
completely O
for O
2 O
weeks O
telling O
me O
I O
might O
get O
my O
passport O
back O
only O
in O
January, O

start O

I O
am O
pretty O
sure O
I B-Health
have I-Health
autism, I-Health
but O
I O
don’t O
want O
to O
get O
an O
official O
diagnosis. O
[SEP]
I B-Age
am I-Age
19, I-Age
since B-Time
age I-Time
17 I-Time
I B-Health
started I-Health
thinking I-Health
I I-Health
could I-Health
be I-Health
autistic. I-Health
Now O
after O
two O
years O
I O
think O
it’s O
pretty O
certain O
that O
I O
am. O
People O
around O
me O
think O
so O
too O
except O
my O
parents O
who O
are O
against O
diagnoses O
of O
anything O
that O
isn’t O
“physical O
health O
issues”. O
They O
said O
I O
am O
too O
capable O
to O
have O
autism. O
Well, O
the O
whole O
thing O
is O
autism O
resources O
have O
saved O
my O
life. O
And O
understanding O
that O
I O
perhaps O
wasn’t O
weird O
and O
just O
a O
little O
difference O
made O
me O
feel O
a O
lot O
more O
confident O
after O
years O
of O
school O
bullying. O
But O
I O
don’t O
want O
an O
official O
diagnosis. O
I O
don’t O
want O
medical O
help O
because O
doctors O
are O
often O
rude O
or O
invalidating O
and O
I O
am O
sensitive. O
I O
also O
don’t O
want O
it O
because O
I O
don’t O
want O
it O
to O
bother O
my O
future O
jobs. O
I O
don’t O
know. O
I O
function O
decently O
because O
I O
have O
a O
support O
system O
that O
helps O
me O
a O
lot. O
But O
yeah. O

Side O

That O
being O

you’re O
still O
welcome O

I O
just O
got O
mine O
a O

it O
also O
took O
me O
a O

that O
to O
even O
decide O

I O
wanted O
one. O

I O

the O

self O

the O
awkward O

My O
therapist O
who O
diagnosed O
me O
advised O
me O
not O
to O
get O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
as O
it O
can O
limit O
my O
future, O
such O
as O
if O
I O
want O
to O
adopt O
or O
foster O
or O
move O
to O
another O
country. O
She O
said O
only O
if O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
need O
the O
help. O
It’s O
sad O
that O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
is O
so O
limiting O
😞 O
[SEP]
I O
tried O
to O
get O
diagnosed O
but O
my O
mom O
said O
there O
was O
nothing O
weird O
about O
me O
growing O
up O
at O
all O
meanwhile O
she O
is O
probably O
autistic O
too, O
but O
my O
doc O
was O
just O
like O
🤷‍♀️ O
you O
seem O
normal! O
[SEP]
After O
the O
immigration O
to O
New O

stuff O
coming O
out O
I've O
personally O
decided O
against O
it. O
Not O
that O
that's O
in O
the O
plans O
at O
all, O
but O
I'm O
sure O
there O
are O
many O
more O
ableist O
policies O
we O
don't O
know O
about. O

If O
I O
need O
accommodations O
I O
think O
any O
company O
that O
requires O
proof O
instead O
of O
just O
listening O
to O
me O
isn't O
really O
something O
I O
want O
to O
support. O
Though O
if O
it's O
for O
official O
reasons O
and O
not O
a O
reflection O
of O
the O
employer O
themselves, O
I O
have O
my O
adhd O
diagnosis O
that O
I O
can O
use. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Idk, O
just O
seems O
like O
the O
world O
is O
against O
us O
no O
matter O
what O
we O
do, O
we O
just O
get O
to O
pick O
the O
flavour O
of O
discrimination. O
[SEP]
This O
happened O
with O
a O
weird O
number O
of O
parents O
at O
the O
school O
I O
used O
to O
teach O
at. O
Refusing O
to O
let O
their O
kids O
access O
help O
and O
resources O
but O
only O
about O
autism O
and O
adhd. O
Depression O
and O
other O
mental O
health O
was O
helped O
with, O
but O
not O
these. O
So O
much O
ableism. O
You O
don't O
need O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
to O
say O
you O
are O
autistic O
in O
my O
opinion, O
if O
you've O
really O
looked O
into O
it O
and O
the O
words O
"autism O
resources O
have O
saved O
my O
life" O
sounds O
like O
you O
have. O
I O
have O
a O
diagnosis O
and O
I O
think O
it's O
gatekeeping O
bullshit O
and O
I O
was O
only O
able O
to O
access O
those O
services O
when O
telehealth O
exploded O
thanks O
to O
COVID. O
Since O
things O
like O
parents, O
bias, O
money, O
health O
insurance, O
lack O
of O
resources, O
racism, O
sexism, O
all O
make O
the O
system O
ineffective O
and O
inequitable, O
and O
traumatizing, O
requiring O
someone O
to O
go O
through O
that O
system O
to O
have O
an O
outsider O
judge O
their O
inner O
experience O
and O
life O
is O
morally O
wrong, O
in O
my O
opinion. O
Does O
that O
mean O
maybe O
sometimes O
people O
will O
claim O
they're O
autistic O
and O
not O
be? O
Yeah. O
Yes, O
absolutely, O
people O
will O
be O
wrong O
and O
incorrectly O
diagnose O
sometimes. O
I O
don't O
care, O
because O
the O
alternative O
is O
more O
autistic O
people O
suffering O
without O
resources O
and O
validation, O
which O
is O
what O
we O
have O
now O
and O
it O
sucks. O
We O
have O
rampant O
misdiagnosis O
and O
prejudice O
by O
out-of-date O
'experts'. O
It's O
a O
mess. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
need O
what O
resources O
are O
being O
kept O
away O
from O
you, O
then O
you O
can O
decide O
if O
you O
want O
to O
wade O
into O
the O
morass. O
But O
if O
you O
want O
one O
for O
permission O
to O
recognize O
your O
identity O
and O
your O
needs? O
You O
don't O
need O
one, O
you're O
autistic, O
and O
you O
already O
sound O
like O
you O
are O
on O
the O
right O
path O
to O
understanding O
that O
and O
finding O
resources. O

My O

I O

my O

my O

about O
as O
well O
as O
I O

Parents O
think O
they O

more O

they O
do O

just O
remember O
that O
you O

My B-Family
dad I-Family

the O

from O
the O

my O

You O
are O
totally O

Many O
do O

both O

All O
the O

people O
thinking O
I O
was O
"weird", O
the O
social O
difficulties O
I've O
had O
(and O
still O
have), O
the O
way O
I O
was O
speech O

the O
extreme O
strife O
going O

Anyway. O
I O
still O
don't O
know O
if O
I O
will O

an O
official O

I O
hear O
such O
horror O
stories O
about O

I O
was O
19. O
Unfortunately, O
like O
most O
people, O
my O

was O
limited. O

then O
again, O
it's O
only O
been O
recently O
that O
we've O
had O
more O
studies O
done O

it O

it's O
a O

ableism O

internalised O
ableism O
prevent O
people O
from O
seeking O

it O
is O
a O
very O
real O

if O

you're O

a O

can O

depending O

your O

it O
could O
unfortunately O
also O

do O

okay O
too! O
if O
you O
find O
you O
don't O
need O
the O

it O
will O
hinder O

you're O

do O

for O
two O
and O
a O
half O
years O
that O
I O
have O
autism, O
but O
I O
don't O
want O
a O
formal O
diagnosis. O
The O
reasons O
are: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
\- O
I B-Location
live I-Location
in I-Location
the I-Location
US I-Location
and O
a O
diagnosis O
is O
really O
expensive, O
even O
with O
health O
insurance O
[SEP]
[SEP]
\- O
It O
seems O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
psychiatrists O
that O
have O
an O
outdated O
view O
of O
autism, O
especially O
autism O
in O
women O
or O
any O
traits O
that O
don't O
fit O
the O
Rain O
Man O
sort O
of O
stereotypes, O
and O
don't O
want O
someone O
uninformed O
invalidating O
my O
experience O
[SEP]
[SEP]
\- O
My O
therapist O
is O
an O
autistic O
woman O
who O
specializes O
in O
autism O
and O
agrees O
that O
I'm O
autistic O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
have O
plenty O
of O
time O
to O
get O
diagnosed O
if O
you O
want O
to. O
Many O
people O
get O
diagnosed O
later O
in O
life, O
even O
in O
middle O
age O
or O
old O
age. O
The O
actor O
Anthony O
Hopkins O
got O
diagnosed O
in O
his O
70s. O
I'd O
say O
take O
it O
slow O
and O
don't O
do O
anything O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
just O
because O
of O
societal O
pressure O
or O
ignorant O
people O
who O
look O
down O
on O
self O
diagnosis. O
[SEP]
You O
don’t O
have O
to O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
if O
you O
don’t O
want O
to! O
There’s O
not O
a O
massive O
benefit O
to O
having O
an O
autism O
diagnosis O
in O
the O
UK, O
because O
it O
doesn’t O
get O
you O
any O
help O
or O
medication O
whereas O
an O
ADHD O
assessment O
lets O
you O
get O
access O
to O
medication. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
lot O
of O
professionals O
are O
also O
pretty O
late O
to O
the O
autism O
research O
party. O
They O
still O
think O
to O
be O
autistic O
you O
have O
to O
be O
an O
non O
verbal O
boy O
who O
is O
aggressive. O
You O
could O
end O
up O
getting O
assessed O
by O
an O
old O
school O
psych O
who O
might O
end O
up O
invalidating O
you O
and O
making O
you O
feel O
worse. O
Self O
diagnosis O
is O
valid O
in O
the O
autistic O
community, O
I O
work O
in O
mental O
health O
and O
we O
assume O
anyone O
referred/asked O
for O
an O
assessment O
has O
autism O
because O
it’s O
very O
hard O
to O
get O
an O
assessment O
on O
the O
NHS, O
so O
self O
diagnosis O
is O
also O
valid O
in O
healthcare O
settings O
too. O
I O
think O
as O
long O
as O
you O
know O
yourself O
and O
you’re O
happy O
to O
not O
have O
a O
professional O
confirm O
it O
for O
you O
then O
I O
think O
you O
should O
use O
the O
autism O
label O
if O
you O
feel O
it O
fits O
you! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
NHS O
psychiatrist O
diagnosed O
me O
but O
he’s O
not O
a O
neurodevelopmental O
specialist O
so O
I O
still O
need O
an O
“official O
assessment.” O
I’m O
not O
going O
to O
bother O
because O
it O
won’t O
get O
me O
anything O
extra. O
In O
fact O
during O
COVID O
our O
government O
used O
having O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
autism/any O
major O
disability O
like O
Down O
syndrome O
as O
a O
reason O
to O
stop O
disabled O
people O
getting O
ventilators. O
I’m O
also O
assuming O
in O
the O
US O
or O
any O
other O
insurance O
based O
country O
having O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
could O
make O
your O
insurance O
more O
expensive? O
[SEP]
I O
feel O
the O
same O
way. O
I O
function O
with O
support O
and O
fortunate O
circumstances O
[SEP]
Personally O
I O
see O
no O
need O
for O
a O
medical O
diagnosis O
unless O
it O
is O
necessary O
for O
government O
aid. O
What O
I O
DO O
suggest O
is O
finding O
a O
good O
therapist O
who O
is O
also O
ND/Autistic O
to O
help O
you O
navigate O
a O
world O
built O
for O
neurotypicals. O
My O
life O
has O
been O
made O
infinitely O
easier O
for O
mine! O
[SEP]
I O
am O
self O
diagnosed. O
My O
father O
was O
diagnosed O
late O
in O
life. O
I O
started O
suspecting O
that O
I O
was O
when O
he O
received O
his O
diagnosis. O
My O
confirmation O
came O
when O
my O
daughter O
was O
up O
for O
an O
updated O
eval O
for O
her O
adhd O
diagnosis. O
The O
doctor O
removed O
her O
adhd O
diagnosis O
and O
diagnosed O
autism. O
When O
the O
doctor O
was O
going O
through O
her O
autistic O
traits O
I O
could’ve O
cried. O
One O
because O
I O
always O
knew O
she O
was O
autistic O
and O
two O
because O
all O
of O
the O
listed O
traits O
are O
traits O
my O
daughter O
shares O
with O
me. O
[SEP]
A O
lot O
of O
the O
signs O
of O
autism O
are O
also O
signs O
of O
other O
neurological O
conditions. O
ADHD O
and O
schizophrenia O
as O
2 O
examples. O
Find O
a O
psychologist O
you O
click O
with O
and O
work O
through O
things O
with O
them O
to O
get O
an O
outside O
opinion O
[SEP]
The O
amount O
of O
times O
I’ve O
been O
told O
“really? O
I O
would O
have O
never O
guessed” O
by O
people O
I’ve O
told O
about O
my O
diagnosis, O
it’s O
happened O
so O
many O
times. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
don't O
want O
a O
diagnosis, O
that's O
entirely O
your O
choice. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
me O
personally, O
it O
was O
a O
relief. O
But O
I O
can O
see O
where O
it O
could O
make O
things O
more O
difficult O
for O
me, O
too. O
But O
that's O
okay. O
I'll O
get O
to O
where O
I O
need O
to O
be. O
Whatever O
your O
choice O
is, O
it's O
completely O
valid, O
and O
you're O
welcome O
to O
be O
here O
as O
a O
fellow O
autist O
with O
or O
without O
diagnosis O
:) O
[SEP]
Self-diagnosis O
is O
absolutely O
valid O
& O
is O
supported. O
I’m O
formally O
diagnosed O
& O
I O
wish O
I O
never O
had O
been O
as O
I O
experienced O
severe O
discrimination O
& O
bullying O
for O
it, O
even O
as O
an O

whether O

'okay' O
for O

even O

myself O

such, O
even O
though O
I've O
strongly O
suspected O
I O
am O
for O
almost O
10 O
years O
now... O
And O
moreso O
the O
experiences O
of O
being O
autistic O
have O
strongly O
resonated O
with O
me O

my O

Curious- O
how O
is O
moving O
to O
another O
country O
limited O
by O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
of O
autism? O
Also, O
are O
autistic O
adults O
not O
allowed O
to O
adopt O
in O
the O
U.S.? O
[SEP]
Same O
I B-Family
noticed I-Family
my I-Family
parents I-Family
have I-Family
autistic I-Family
traits I-Family
as I-Family
well. I-Family
Like O
they O
always O
get O
the O
weird O
stares O
at O
dinner O
parties… O
and O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
bad O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
think O
being O
autistic O
is O
all O
about O
being O
and O
acting O
weird. O
Our O
daughter O
is O
actually O
more O
normal O
than O
most O
children O
her O
age, O
I’m O
guessing O
you O
could O
say O
that’s O
strange! O
She O
can O
seem O
a O
bit O
aloof O
and O
watches O
them O
and O
shakes O
her O
head O
watching O
many O
children. O
[SEP]
When O
I O
talk O
with O
my O
daughter O
she O
is O
eloquent O
and O
smart O
and O
seems O
very O
normal. O
I O
think O
it’s O
many O
times O
about O
autistic O
people O
understanding O
themselves O
in O
a O
world O
that O
seems O
very O
weird O
[SEP]
Wow, O
that O
got O
quite O
dark. O
It's O
not O
who O
I O
usually O
am O
but O
idk O
the O
topic O
just O
gets O
to O
me O
[SEP]
Our O
child O
is O
amazing, O
we O
now O
know O
she O
is O
autistic O
because O
we O
took O
an O
interest O
in O
finding O
out O
what O
autism O
truly O
was O
in O
girls O
and O
women. O
I O
was O
very O
dismissive O
of O
her O
initial O
cry’s O
for O
help O
because O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
autism O
was O
but O
she O
did O
as O
an O
11 O
year O
old O
girl. O
It’s O
all O
about O
the O
research O
daddy O
😂 O
we O
now O
understand O
researching O
is O
part O
of O
her O
autism. O
We B-Location
live I-Location
in I-Location
the I-Location
uk I-Location
and O
the O
help O
you O
can O
get O
here O
is O
non O
existent, O
in O
fact O
it’s O
so O
backwards O
you O
have O
to O
fight O
for O
any O
recognition. O
We O
are O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
into O
self O
diagnosing O
her O
autism O
and O
we O
have O
another O
two O
years O
waiting O
for O
an O
official O
stamp. O
[SEP]
Our O
gp O
said O
my O
daughter O
can’t O
be O
autistic O
because O
she O
looked O
him O
in O
the O
eyes O
😂 O
we O
spent O
many O
hours O
teaching O
her O
to O
look O
at O
peoples O
shoulders O
or O
just O
above O
the O
head O
[SEP]
The O
main O
thing O
preventing O
me O
is O
my O
fear O
of O
having O
a O
traumatic O
experience O
with O
the O
doctor O
doing O
my O
assessment. O
I O
have O
had O
very O
traumatic O
medical O
situations O
before. O
I O
will O
try O
to O
work O
that O
idea O
in O
my O
mind O
and O
see O
when O
I O
feel O
ready. O
Because O
I O
do O
want O
to O
get O
an O
assessment O
done, O
I O
am O
just O
scared. O
Thank O
you. O

[SEP]
I O
100% O
agree O
self O
diagnosis O
is O
valid O
and O
it’s O
nice O
to O
hear O
a O
medical O
professional O
agreeing! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
An O
autism O
diagnosis O
via O
NHS O
in O
U.K. O
got O
me O
the O
following: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Access O
to O
disability O
support O
services O
which O
is O
a O
lovely O
lady O
that O
came O
and O
essentially O
fixed O
my O
life O
(I O
had O
debt O
and O
calls/letters O
that O
needing O
chasing, O
she O
sorted O
it O
all), O
[SEP]
Access O
to O
PiP O
which O
gives O
me O
an O
extra O
£500 O
per O
month O
none O
means O
tested O
to O
make O
life O
a O
little O
easier, O
[SEP]
Access O
to O
long O
term O
disability O
benefits O
if O
I O
find O
myself O
out O
of O
work O
(don’t O
need O
it O
rn O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
ASD O
end O
up O
without O
work), O
[SEP]
Free O
and O
easy O
access O
to O
an O
NHS O
dentist O
(there’s O
a O
community O
care O
dentist O
in O
every O
major O
city O
that O
you O
have O
to O
be O
disabled O
to O
access), O
[SEP]
Easier O
access O
to O
therapies O
tailored O
to O
ASD O
and O
also O
medications O
(I’m O
given O
argument O
free O
diazepam O
to O
use O
when O
I O
see O
fit O
whereas O
that’s O
usually O
difficult O
to O
obtain, O
I O
use O
it O
sparingly O
for O
high O
anxiety O
situ), O
[SEP]
Priority O
register O
with O
energy O
companies O
so O
if O
the O
power O
goes O
out O
I O
get O
it O
back O
quickly/if O
works O
are O
planned O
I O
get O
advanced O
notice O
etc O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
may O
not O
need O
any O
of O
that O
but O
I O
think O
it’s O
really O
important O
that O
people O
know O
that O
that’s O
available O
to O
them. O
I O
honestly O
need O
some O
of O
that O
but O
I O
think O
my O
son O
is O
getting O
the O
real O
benefit. O
He’s O
14, O
diagnosed O
at O
10 O
and O
wow, O
I O
got O
him O
an O
EHCP O
(education O
healthcare O
plan) O
with O
the O
local O
council O
so O
he O
gets: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
placement O
at O
a O
local O
ASD O
school O
with O
12 O
kids O
per O
class O
and O
4 O
teachers O
(wtf O
right?!), O
[SEP]
No O
bullying O
ever O
cus O
his O
schoolmates O
are O
like O
him O
and O
omg O
did O
I O
mention O
the O
12 O
kids O
per O
class?! O
That O
place O
is O
Hogwarts, O
[SEP]
Access O
to O
PiP O
also O
which O
is O
around O
£450 O
per O
month O
rn O
and O
will O
increase O
and O
be O
paid O
to O
him O
direct O
when O
he O
turns O
16 O
regardless O
of O
income, O
[SEP]
Advanced O
support O
on O
the O
transition O
from O
school O
to O
college O
including O
an O
offered O
placement O
at O
an O
ASD O
college O
which O
has O
lines O
of O
ASD O
friendly O
businesses O
connected O
waiting O
to O
employ O
them, O
[SEP]
Extensive O
support O
when O
he O
chooses O
to O
join O
university O
(the O
list O
I O
saw O
was O
crazy, O
from O
extra O
financial O
aid, O
free O
computers O
and O
extra O
time O
for O
tests), O
[SEP]
Lastly O
he’ll O
have O
the O
supports O
I O
have O
but O
getting O
all O
this O
support O
early O
really O
gives O
him O
a O
leg O
up O
[SEP]
My O
psychotherapist O
who O
I've O
been O
with O
for O
a O
few O
years O
now O
alerted O
me O
to O
being O
autistic O
recently, O
and O
from O
there O
everything O
has O
fallen O
into O
place O
and O
it's O
been O
a O
journey O
of O
self O
acceptance O
to O
say O
the O
least. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
an O
NHS O
assessment O
but O
the O
wait O
is O
over O
18 O
months O
and O
going O
private O
costs O
2K, O
but O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
am O
less O
valid O
in O
people's O
eyes O
if O
I O
don't O
have O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
(also O
imposter O
syndrome), O
so O
I O
am O
probably O
going O
to O
fork O
out O
the O
money. O
It O
sucks. O
[SEP]
No O
I O
didn't O
silence O
anything. O
I O
routinely O
paste O
this O
link O
because O
reddit O
population O
is O
so O
changing, O
new O
people O
are O
here O
every O
hour, O
I O
suspect. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
it O
is O
really O
important O
that O
a O
major O
USA O
uni O
is O
taking O
this O
stance. O
[SEP]
So? O
[SEP]
There O
was O
a O
thread O
this O
week O
about O
how O
an O
autism O
diagnosis O
can O
limit O
immigration O
- O
a O
lot O
of O
"developed" O
countries O
consider O
autism O
a O
reason O
to O
reject O
your O
application. O
I O
was O
specifically O
interested O
in O
Australia O
- O
apparently O
they O
rejected O
a O
kid O
bc O
of O
their O
autism, O
but O
gave O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
kid's O
family O
entry, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
bc O
of O
international O
outrage O
that O
the O
kid O
was O
accepted. O
So O
yeah, O
any O
musings O
about O
official O
diagnosis O
have O
officially O
gone O
out O
the O
window O
for O
me O
:') O
[SEP]
There O
was O
a O
post O
about O
this O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago, O
specifically O
about O
New O
Zealand. O
I O
think O
it O
was O
here O
but O
I'm O
not O
100% O
sure. O
Sorry, O
I O
don't O
feel O
like O
fishing O
for O
it O
right O
now, O
but O
yeah, O
sadly O
not O
BS. O
Certain O
countries, O
certain O
states O

Yeah O
weird O
isn't O
quite O
the O
right O
word O
but O
she O
told O
me O
doctor O
there O
was O
absolutely O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
in O
any O
way O
about O
me. O
Like O
she O
couldn't O
come O
up O
with O
anything O
at O
all O
that O
might O
interest O
him. O
Which O
doesn't O
make O
sense O
because O
she O
told O
me O
plenty O
of O
stories O
of O
my O
behavior O
as O
a O
child O
that O
seemed O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
to O
me. O
Her O
favorite O
thing O
to O
describe O
me O
as O
was O
"an O
old O
soul" O
because O
of O
how O
unchildlike O
I O
acted, O
and O
she O
did O
not O
mention O
that O
at O
all O
to O
the O
doctor. O
[SEP]
No O
of O
course O
I’m O
glad O
you O
commented O
because O
I O
didn’t O
know O
that O
was O
all O
available! O
Like O
at O
all??? O
I’m O
actually O
in O
shock!! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
well O
aware O
that O
getting O
diagnosed O
as O
early O
as O
possible O
for O
children O
is O
so O
important O
as O
that O
obviously O
unlocks O
support O
in O
schools O
etc O
so O
if O
OP O
wasn’t O
already O
an O
adult O
I’d O
have O
100% O
suggested O
going O
for O
an O
assessment. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
in O
the O
NHS O
trust O
I O
work O
for O
there O
doesn’t O
seem O
to O
be O
anything O
available O
to O
those O
who O
have O
level O
one/mild O
severity O
autism. O
As O
the O
NHS O
diagnosed O
me O
it’s O
just O
not O
from O
the O
“official” O
autism O
psychiatrist, O
it O
is O
on O
my O
notes O
and O
things O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
basically O
treated O
as O
if O
I O
have O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
as O
my O
GP, O
LMHT, O
crisis O
team O
etc O
all O
recognises O
it. O
As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
professionally O
and O
what O
I O
have O
been O
offered O
there’s O
nothing O
in O
terms O
of O
massive O
support O
network O
or O
therapy O
offered O
which O
is O
tailored O
to O
ASD. O
Any O
clients, O
both O
on O
the O
wards O
and O
in O
the O
community O
with O
ASD O
have O
only O
been O
offered O
CBT O
which O
isn’t O
great O
for O
ND O
people. O
I O
applied O
for O
PIP O
and O
was O
awarded O
enhanced O
rates O
for O
ASD O
despite O
not O
having O
an O
“official” O
diagnosis O
so O
I O
have O
that O
but O
other O
than O
that O
I O
haven’t O
seen O
any O
benefits. O
My O
LMHT O
told O
me O
the O
neurodevelopmental O
special O
services O
in O
my O
city O
offer O
support O
once O
diagnosed O
but O
when O
I O
spoke O
to O
them O
they O
told O
me O
they O
do O
the O
assessment O
and O
discharge O
you O
without O
further O
support. O
Unless O
you O
have O
ADHD O
and O
they O
will O
keep O
you O
on O
through O
medication O
titration. O

The O
dentist O
thing O
has O
especially O
blown O
my O
mind! O
I’m O
terrified O
of O
the O
dentist O
and O
have O
only O
had O
one O
procedure O
without O
full O
on O
sedation. O
I O
asked O
both O
my O
LMHT O
and O
my O
dentist O
if O
there O
is O
a O
service O
for O
people O
with O
autism O
and O
sensory O
issues O
to O
get O
sedation O
done O
quicker/free O
and O
I O
was O
told O
there’s O
nothing! O
I O
even O
posted O
in O
the O
DWP O
Reddit O
asking O
if O
PIP O
allows O
you O
access O
to O
dental O
surgeries O
and O
everyone O
said O
not O
really O
no. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
actually O
shocked! O
In O
work O
we O
help O
people O
apply O
for O
PIP O
and O
such O
and O
that’s O
all O
we O
suggest O
other O
than O
a O
referral O
to O
adult O
social O
care. O
I O
guess O
it O
really O
is O
an O
NHS/social O
care O
lottery. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
glad O
you O
have O
got O
so O
much O
out O
of O
the O
diagnosis O
and O
it’s O
allowed O
you O
to O
set O
up O
things O
for O
your O
son. O
I O
genuinely O
didn’t O
think O
it O
did O
much O
because O
where O
I O
am O
it O
really O
doesn’t O
seem O
to! O

ETA: O
I’ve O
been O
prescribed O
diazepam O
for O
stressful O
life O
events O
a O
few O
times O
but O
that O
was O
all O
pre O
diagnosis. O
As O
far O
as O
I’m O
aware O
and O
from O
what O
my O
psych O
said O
there’s O
no O
meds O
specifically O
for O
autism O
and O
wouldn’t O
prescribe O
anything O
for O
my O
intense O
anxiety O
😟 O
[SEP]
I O
so O
get O
you, O
I O
do O
really O
struggle O
with O
imposter O
syndrome O
too. O
I O
have O
to O
regularly O
look O
at O
my O
clinic O
letter O
from O
my O
psychology O
where O
it O
says O
I O
have O
“probable O
autism O
of O
mild O
severity” O
under O
my O
working O
diagnosis. O
I’ve O
just O
put O
the O
deposit O
down O
for O
a O
private O
ADHD O
assessment O
because O
although O
my O
psychiatrist O
thinks O
I O
have O
it, O
as O
they’re O
not O
working O
for O
the O
neurodevelopmental O
service O
and O
they’re O
controlled O
drugs O
he O
can’t O
prescribe O
the O
medication O
for O
me O
and O
I O
didn’t O
want O
to O
wait. O
So O
deffo O
understand O
your O
pain. O
Just O
remember O
you’re O
valid O
even O
if O
one O
day O
they O
assess O
you O
and O
for O
some O
reason O
you O
don’t O
get O
the O
diagnosis! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Still O
apply O
for O
PIP O
though O
with O
autism O
as O
a O
diagnosis! O
I B-Health
was I-Health
awarded I-Health
PIP I-Health
for I-Health
my I-Health
autism I-Health
with O
just O
that O
letter O
and O
you O
could O
put O
your O
psychotherapist O
down O
and O
they O
can O
contact O
them O
for O
clarification. O

I O

much O
about O
the O
doctors, O
from O
my O
experience O
they O
don’t O
seem O

be O
to O
smart. O
My O
ex O
was O
a O
gp O
and O
a O
surgeon O
and O
she O
told O
me O
never O
trust O
the O
word O
of O
a O
doctor. O
I O
think O
that O
speaks O
volumes O
😂 O
[SEP]
I’m O
so O
glad O
you O
help O
people O
apply O
for O
PiP. O
That O
thing O
is O
life O
changing O
and O
so O
damn O
hard O
to O
get O
without O
a O
professional O
to O
help O
and O
validate O
your O
claim. O
I O
hope O
you O
know O
how O
appreciated O
that O
is, O
I O
was O
nervous O
about O
being O
weird O
when O
my O
nurse O
hooked O
me O
up O
but O
I O
wanted O
to O
cry O
and O
hug O
her! O

I O

it’s O
an O

it O
is O
an O

I’m O
amazed O
you O
can O
get O
PiP O
that’s O
awesome!! O
I O
honestly O
thought O
you O
had O
to O
have O
a O
concrete O
diagnosis O
cus O
they O
had O
me O
show O
them O
our O
papers O
when O
I O
applied, O
thank O
you O
for O
that O
I O
know O
a O
couple O
of O
ppl O
irl O
that O
that’s O
going O
to O
help! O

The O

that O
diagnosed O
me O
(LANC O

basically O
gave O
me O
my O
papers O
and O
said O
off O
you O
pop! O
Super O
helpful… O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’ve O
found O
a O
lot O
of O
places O
offered O
support/concessions O
without O
an O
official O
diagnosis O
cus O
it’s O
not O
like O
they’re O
going O
to O
ask O
to O
see O
your O
papers O
so O
I O
always O
tell O
autistic O
peeps O
I O
know O
to O
just O
say O
they O
are O
if O
self O
diagnosed O
as O
they’ll O
still O
have O

won’t O
due O

the O

I O
can O

I O
wouldn’t O

it O

[SEP]
Just O
what O
the O

I'm O

specifically O
to O
women's O

because O
I'm B-Gender
a I-Gender

[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
specific O
questions O
are: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
much O
of O
your O
arm/ O
leg O
do O
you O
need O
to O
cover, O
e.g. O
are O
three-quarter O
sleeves O
ok? O
Is O
exposing O
your O
feet O
(as O
in, O
by O
wearing O
sandals) O
ok? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Is O
visible O
jewellery O
okay? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
your O
face O
looks O
prettier O
than O
an O
average O
person's O
face, O
to O
the O
point O
where O
it O
can O
attract O
attention O
on O
its O
own, O
is O
this O
tabarruj? O
[SEP]
The O
minimum O
is O
that O
the O
whole O
body O
needs O
to O
be O
covered O
up, O
including O
feet, O
except O
for O
the O
face/hands O
(even O
though O
there O
is O
a O
difference O
of O
opinion O
about O
niqab, O
which O
I O
should O
point O
out). O
So O
three O
quarter O
sleeves O
and O
showing O
your O
feet O
do O
not O
meet O
the O
criteria. O

The O
same O
thing O
happens O
to O
me. O
The O
problem O
is O
that O
I B-Health
have I-Health
a I-Health
slight I-Health
hearing I-Health
loss I-Health
since B-Time
I I-Time
was I-Time
little I-Time

I O
started O
daydreaming, O
I O
couldn't O
stop O
putting O
my O
headphones O
on O
withthe O
music O
at O
maximum O
volume O
and O
that O
is O
very O
dangerous O
for O
me. O
I O
haven't O
lost O
more O
hearing, O
but O
I O
started O
to O
hear O
a O
ringing O
in O
my O
ear O
that O
I O
think O
is O
tinnitus. O
It O
has O
been O
very O
hard O
for O
me, O
but O
every O
time O
I O
try O
to O
resist O
and O
turn O
down O
the O
volume O
of O
the O
music, O
but O
sometimes O
I O
put O
the O
music O
at O
maximus O
volume O
again, O
but O
now O
it O
doesn't O
happen O
that O
much. O
I O
have O
the O
same O
fear O
you O
have O
because O
I'm O
also O
a O

I O
love O
music O
and O
I O
can't O
live O
without O
it. O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
advice O
I O
could O
give O
you, O
but O
I O
sometimes O
try O
to O
hide O
my O
headphones O
to O
avoid O
picking O
them O
up, O
but O
I O
know O
it's O
really O
hard. O
Also O
I O
think O
other O
thing O
that O
helped O
me O
was O
watching O
the O
movie O
Sound O
of O
Metal O
which O

realize O

[SEP]
I’ve O
noticed O
for O
awhile O
but O
never O
thought O
much O
because O
I O
was O
always O
smoking O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
true O
sent O
comparedto O
someone O
who O
is O
not O
smoking. O
I B-Other
recently I-Other
stopped I-Other
smoking I-Other
and O
everytime O
someone O
walks O
by O
smoking O
makes O
me O
not O
wanting O
go O
back O
ever. O
Doesn’t O
smell O
like O
the O
weed O
I O
remember O
before O
it O
went O
legal O
doesn’t O
smell O
right O
smells O
off. O
And O
everywhere O
I O
go O
everyone O
smoking O
has O
that O
same O
scent O
of O
burnt O
rubber. O
I O
looked O
it O
up O
and O
they O
that O
smell O
is O
neem O
oil O
that O
is O
used O
to O
kill O
mites O
when O
there O
is O
an O
infestation. O
I’ve B-Other
been I-Other
smoking I-Other
for B-Time
15 I-Time
years I-Time
and O
never O
smelled O
this O
before O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
weed O
downs O
not O
smoke O
heavy O
very O
light O
smoke O
when O
you O
take O
a O

also O
it O
hard O

a O

I’ve O
tried O
all O
the O

all O
the O

all O
the O

all O
the O
quarters.I O
remember O
an O
old O
man O
telling O
me O
to O
watch O
out O
with O
the O
weed O
once O
the O
government O
takes O
over O
there O
never O
in O
the O
business O
of O
bettering O
people O
just O
destroying O
them. O
I O
remember O
seeing O
a O
documentary O
where O
they O
took O
bunch O
different O
weed O
to O
the O
laboratory O
to O
check O
for O
thc O
and O
cbd O
percentage. O
They O
said O
that O
cbd O
is O
naturally O
occuring O
in O
marijuana O
to O
counter O
balanxce O
the O
schizophrenia O
that O
weed O
causes O
the O
test O
came O
back O
with O
0% O
cbd O
on O
all O
the O

that O
it O

out O

it’s O
out O

is O

It's O
a O

reasonable O

at O

price. O
[SEP]
That's O
the O
half O
oz O
price. O
[SEP]
Wish O
I O
could. O
I O
unfortunately O
live O
in O
a O

Tried O
growing O
outdoor O
a O
couple O

it O
was O

Berry O
Smasher! O
I O

Edit: O
the O

closed O
when O
I O

there O
so O
I O
hit O
up O
a O
Value O
Buds O
(gross, O
I O
know) O
and O
grabbed O
two O
half O
oz’s O
of O
Red O
Fatso O
from O
Doja. O
Definitely O
spent O
more O
than O
I O
wanted, O
but O
I’m O
feelin’ O
preeetttty O
glonky O
right O
now. O
[SEP]
Bought O
the O
Berry O
Smasher O
120 O
plus O
tax O
and O
found O
it O
alot O
better O
than O
the O
cheaper O
100 O

Ive O
been O
smoking. O
[SEP]
Can O
confirm O
Berry O
Smasher O
is O
pretty O
good. O
A O
little O
larfy O
(well O
more O
“airy”) O
but O
very O
good O
stuff O
for O
the O
price. O
I O
too O
got O
sick O
of O
BBOB O
Pink O

(and O
I O
loved O
it O
at O

the O

I O
work O
through O

somehow O

I’ve O

dry, O
kernels O

I’ve O
tried O
most O

my O
point O
is O
that O
the O

is O
way O
off. O
[SEP]
pink O

from O

[SEP]
Pink O
Cookies, O

to O
be O
honest O
I'm O
off O
the O
BBOB O
wagon. O
The O
last O

I O
got O
were O
VERY O
harsh. O
The O

there. O

the O

for O

[SEP]
How O
is O
it?? O
How O
does O
it O
compare O
to O
Pink O
Cookies? O
[SEP]
True, O
but O
the O
average O
(good/fire) O
ounce O
shouldn’t O
be O
$180+. O
If O
you’re O
talking O
about O
quads/quads+ O
then O
I O
understand. O
But, O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
bud O
at O
110-120 O
could O
be O
lowered. O
It’s O
because O
of O
the O
major O
overhead O
the O
companies O
have O
(employees, O
buildings, O
taxes, O
licenses, O
etc). O
They’re O
for O
profit, O
so O
if O
they O
can O
squeeze O
$10 O
out O
of O
you O
they O
will. O

why O

That's O
what O
I O
really O
like O
about O
legal O
market. O
I O
go O
for O
the O

when O
I O
can O
so O
I O
KNOW O
it's O
grown O
well. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don't O
need O
the O

So O
long O
as O
theres O
a O

retailer O
or O
even O
in O

nowhere O
I O
could O
mail O

it, O

I O

Thc O

mean O
very O
little O

the O

It’s O
a O
small O
part O
of O
the O
big O
picture. O
And O
yea O
Chads O
vary O
in O
quality O
greatly O
haha. O
There O
are O
many O
illegal O

that O
put O
as O
much O
care O
and O
attention O
to O
detail O
into O
their O
bud O
as O
high O

legal O

do. O
And O
then O
of O
course O
there’s O
absolute O
garbage O
chads O
lol. O
But O
I’d O
rather O
order O
from O
a O
high O
end O
chad O
then O
smoke O
PSF O
any O
day. O
I O
understand O
some O
people O
are O
willing O
to O
compromise O
on O
quality O
and O
value O
by O
settling O
for O
the O
low-end O
legal O
offerings O
because O
it O
feels O
safer O
to O
them, O
but O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
seasoned O
smokers O
that O
stuff O
just O
doesn’t O
cut O
it. O
[SEP]
Then O
why O
you O
buying O

at O
all? O

it O

if O

I O
only O
expect O

nothing. O

Sugarbud O
(RIP), O
Distinkt, O

are O
all O

growers O
with O

much O
better O

Me O
too. O
I O

after O

it’s O
no O

the O
results O
are O
so O
awesome. O
[SEP]
Actually, O
it’s O
about O
the O
same O
from O
legal O

illegal O

Some O
companies O
had O
lied O
to O
Health O
Canada O
about O
what O
they O
were O
using O
and O
hid O
them O
from O
Health O
Canada O
during O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Honestly, O
the O
best O
way O
to O
go O
if O
you O
can, O
growing O
yourself. O
[SEP]
If O
what O
they're O
producing O
is O
*so O

why O

they O
gone O
legit O

scaled O

No O

all O

to O
what O

on O

If O
they O

created O
more O

everything O

a O

[SEP]

in O
the O

is O
to O

They O
could O
make O
stricter O
rules/regulations O
for O
LP’s/labs O
for O

Can O
also O
have O
more O

The O

made O

you O

and O
that O
pure O

is O
better O

I’m O
going O
to O
answer O
your O
stupid O
question O
with O
a O
slightly O
less O
stupid O
question. O
[SEP]
The O

Here's O

we'll O

not. O
The O
latter O

they're O

I'd O
rather O

with O
no O
gatekeeping O

[SEP]
I'm O
perfectly O
happy O
without O

Give O
me O
regulated, O
tested, O
consistent O
mid O

for O
100$ O
everyday O
of O
the O

Then O
i O
have O
my O

also O

could O

any O

All's O
I'm O
saying O
is O
if O
their O
weed O
is O
good, O
clean O
and O
they're O
not O
fucking O
criminals, O
they'd O
go O
legit. O

Not O
any O

any O

yea. O
I’ll O
still O
buy O
some O
cheap O
legal O

just O
for O

It O
is O
nice O
to O
just O
go O
to O
the O
store O
and O
know O
exactly O
what O
I’m O
getting. O
But O
I O
do O
feel O
the O
legal O
market O
is O
just O
sort O
of O
weak O
in O
the O
budget O
oz O
sector. O
And O
did O
you O
smoke O
weed O
pre-legalization? O
Every O
experienced O

was O
a O
“fuckin O

at O

good O
clean O

little O
you O
know… O
Bought O
their O

3 O

was O

twice, O
it O

$10 O
oz O
I O
bought O
in O
Mexico O
[SEP]
Yes, O
I O
smoked O
for O
many O
years O
before O

I O
also O
had O
a O

[SEP]
I O
can't O
speak O
to O

I O
can O
say O
that O
in O
the O
Australian O
job O
market O
you're O
not O
really O
going O
to O
be O
competing O
against O
Ivy O
League O
graduates O
often O
because O
the O
ivy O
league O
doesn't O
exist O
here. O
I O
think O
in O
general O
we O
care O
a O
lot O
less O
about O
University O
rankings. O
I'm O
not O
saying O
it O
doesn't O
matter O
at O
all, O
just O
that O
it O
doesn't O
matter O
that O
much. O
I O
think O
in O
general O
both O
in O
and O
out O
of O
Australia, O
people O
are O
more O
interested O
in O
the O
work O
you've O
done. O
If O
you O
have O
good O
work O
and O
good O
publications O
nobody O
will O
carr O
about O
your O
institution, O
and O
after O
your O
first O

they'll O
care O
even O
less. O
Also O
Swinburne O
isn't O
bad. O
And O
Melbourne O
is O
a O
great O
city. O
And O
those O
funded O
positions O
are O
competitive O
so O
it's O
an O
achievement O
in O
and O
of O
itself O
to O
get O
that. O
If O
you O
like O
the O
course, O
the O
professor, O
and O
the O
city, O
I O
really O
really O
wouldn't O
stress O
about O
the O
prestige. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
the O
common O
advice O
is O
usually O
worry O
more O
about O
the O
advisor O
than O
the O
school. O
That O
being O
said, O
I O
know O
PhDs O
from O
the O
ivy's O
and O
from O
regular O
schools O
and O
it's O
clear O
that O
the O

get O
preference O
for O
all O

Has O
anyone O

Also, O
any O

on O

we O

no O

a O

if O

where O

comes O
from. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Further, O
DFAS O
doesn't O
even O
know O
what O
her O
retired O
pay O
will O
be O
yet O
because O
those O
calculations O
are O
done O
after O

you O
can O
kind O
of O
do O
the O
math O
yourself O
and O
ballpark O
it O
based O
off O
her O

DD-214 O
but O
you O
won't O
the O
final O
answer O
until O
she O
either O
gets O
her O
first O
ERAS O
or O
the O
payment O
hits O
the O

That O
is O
the O
ay O
it O
worked O
when O
I O
retired. O
I O
want O
to O
say O
DFAS O
has O
up O
to O
60 O
days O
to O
start O
paying O
you. O
The O
final O

AD O

is O
held O
pending O
the O

from O
DFAS, O
mine O
was O
released O
45 O
days O
after O
my O

In O
my O
case O
I O
got O
my O
retirement O
check O
the O
following O
month O
but O
I O
know O
guys O
who O
did O
not. O
[SEP]
Might O
be O
some O
confusion O
on O
this. O
I O
believe O
the O
letter O
they O
are O
asking O
for O
is O
to O
see O
if O
you O
need O
to O
pay O
the O
funding O
fee O
or O
not. O
My O
bank O
didn't O
ask O
for O
this O
when O
I O
was O
retiring, O
with O
a O
pending O
disability O
claim, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
pay O
the O
funding O
fee. O
A O
VSO O
might O
be O
able O
to O
help O
get O
this O
letter. O
It O
should O
only O
state O
that O
you O
have O
a O
pending O
claim, O
and O
are O
expected O
to O
get O
10% O
or O
more. O
This O
only O
applies O
if O
you O
are O
closing O
after O
your O
date O
of O
separation, O
not O
if O
you O
are O
closing O
while O
on O
active O
duty, O
because O
your O
date O
of O
disability O
will O
be O
after O
your O
separation O
date. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
they O
are O
asking O
for O
this O
to O
get O
a O
loan O
approval O
they O
are O
wrong, O
this O
is O
only O
used O
for O
closing O
costs(funding O
fee). O
[SEP]
VA O
pays O
for O
disabilities, O
not O
retirement. O
[SEP]
Even O
if O
you O
get O
someone O
to O
answer O
whatever O
phone O
number O
you O
are O
calling, O
VA O
can’t O
give O
you O
a O
letter O
like O
that. O
VA O
is O
not O
part O
of O
the O
military O
so O
won’t O
give O
her O
that O
information. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Get O
a O
different O
bank O
that O
actually O
knows O
what O
they O
are O
doing. O
[SEP]
The O
bank O
wouldn't O
use O
my O
future O
(retiring O
in O
1 O
month) O
retirement O
pay O
as O
it O
had O
not O
happened O
yet. O
We O
had O
to O
find O
another O
way. O
Total O
shit O
[SEP]
Why O
does O
the O
bank O
need O
to O
know O
she O
is O
retiring? O
Not O
what O
you O
asked O
but O
have O
you O
considered O
calling O
a O
mortgage O
broker O
(one O
who O
works O
with O
many O
banks) O
for O
a O
better O
rate/deal? O
[SEP]
The O
bank O
wants O
proof O
of O
income. O
Pretty O
common O
issue O
with O
military O
retiring. O
[SEP]
Yeah O
I O
can O
understand O
that O
but O
what O
if O
the O
member O
is O
not O
gonna O
retire? O
Like O
say O
they O
got O
19 O
years O
and O
they O
wanna O
stay O
until O
26-30 O
years. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Not O
to O
mention O
its O
not O
a O
secret O
how O
military O
retirement O
is O
calculated. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
guess O
I'm O
not O
surprised, O
banks O
have O
definitely O
learned O
from O
the O
housing O
crisis O
15 O
years O
ago. O
[SEP]
If O
they O
aren’t O
going O
to O
retire, O
the O
LES O
would O
reflect O
a O
future O
date. O
[SEP]
Not O
true, O
prior O

if O

High O
insulin O
during O
a O
lifetime O
is O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
causes O
of O
insulin O
resistance. O
Continuing O
to O
shoot O
insulin O
makes O
type O
2 O
a O
progressive O
disease. O
Using O
an O
insulin O
pusher O
(a O
drug O
that O
makes O
the O
pancreas O
produce O
more O
insulin) O
does O
the O
same O
thing. O
Just O
stop O
eating O
carbohydrates O
and O
watch O
your O
BG O
fall. O
I O
can O
say O
this O
from O
experience. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
20 O
years O
ago O
and O
took O
the O
advice O
of O
physicians O
with O
whom O
I O
worked. O
They O
all O
told O
be O
the O
same O
thing, O
"Stop O
eating O
carbohydrates. O
But, O
I O
am O
not O
your O
physician O
and O
did O
not O
tell O
you O
this". O
20 O
years O
later O
I O
am O
still O
on O
an O
extremely O
low O
carb O
diet. O
I O
eat O
about O
20 O
grams O
per O
day. O
I O
started O
this O
diet O
journey O
by O
stopping O
all O
carbohydrates. O
I O
went O
through O
withdrawal O
for O
3 O
days. O
It O
felt O
awful. O
After O
3 O
days O
it O
was O
like O
a O
miracle. O
I O
felt O
better O
than O
I O
had O
in O
so O
many O
years. O
It O
was O
like O
I O
had O
20 O
years O
taken O
off O
my O
age. O
I O
felt O
so O
good O
that O
it O
was O
a O
long O
time O
before O
I O
would O
even O
eat O
anything O
green. O
You O
need O
to O
drink O
100 O

of O
water O
per O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Metformin O
to O
help O
with O
your O
journey. O
I O
prefer O
the O
ER O
version. O
It O
is O
cheap O
and O
has O
proven O
itself O
over O
the O
decades. O
Metformin O
does O
not O
allow O
you O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
eat O
carby O
stuff O
that O
is O
bad O
for O
you. O
It O
just O
helps O
perhaps O
with O
most O
people O
by O
knocking O
off O
10 O
points O
from O
your O
BG O
meter. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Use O
your O
meter O
often! O
believe O
your O
meter. O
If O
you O
want O
to O
know O
how O
a O
food O
affects O
your O
BG, O
you O
need O
to O
eat O
a O
portion O
that O
you O
would O
normally O
eat O
and O
then O
measure O
every O
15 O
minutes O
for O
2 O
to O
3 O
hours. O
You O
need O
to O
detect O
the O
spike. O
Spikes O
count. O
Any O
reading O
over O
140 O
begins O
irreversible O
cellular O
damage. O
Taking O
your O
BG O
2 O
or O
3 O
hours O
after O
you O
eat O
does O
not O
tell O
you O
what O
you O
need O
to O
know O
in O
order O
to O
stay O
healthy O
and O
expect O
the O
same O
lifespan O
as O
a O
non-diabetic. O

[SEP]
Continuing O
to O
eat O
carbohydrates O
and O
covering O
it O
with O
insulin O
or O
a O
pusher, O
will O
eventually O
cause O
serious O
complications O
and O
effect O
your O
quality O
of O
life O
in O
a O
seriously O
negative O
way. O
[SEP]

something O

Question O
[SEP]
I O
am O
fairly O
new O
to O
spark O
and O
have O
a O
question O
for O
those O
who O
have O
been O
doing O
this O
for O
a O
while... O
Orders O
with O
multiple O
deliveries, O
what O
is O
your O
process? O
I B-Possession
drive I-Possession
a I-Possession
Toyota I-Possession
Prius. I-Possession
I O
recently O
had O
two O
orders O
and O
the O
loader O
asked O
which O
order O
I O
wanted O
in O
my O
trunk, O
one O
was O
a O
small O
order O
the O
other O
a O
medium. O
When O
I O
told O
him O
both, O
he O
questioned O
me O
as O
to O
how O
I O
would O
know O
which O
was O
for O
each O
order. O
Told O
him O
the O
smaller O
order O
was O
to O
go O
in O
my O
vmcatering O
bag O
and O
the O
bigger O
one O
out O
if O
the O
bag. O
(I O
was O
planning O
on O
packing O
the O
other O
order O
in O
bigger O
bags O
to O
make O
delivery O
easier, O
just O
wasn't O
trying O
to O
hold O
up O
the O
loader). O
But, O
it O
got O
me O
thinking O
if O
I O
was O
to O
take O
one O
of O
the O
orders O
that O
have O
9-12 O
deliveries, O
even O
though O
most O
were O
one O
or O
two O
items, O
the O
sticker O
would O
be O
on O
that O
single O
bag, O
but O
there O
were O
some O
that O
obviously O
would O
be O
multiple O
bags. O
I O
feel O
slowing O
the O
loader O
down O
while O
I O
pack O
in O
seperate O
"delivery" O
bags O
is O
not O
the O
right O
thing O
to O
do... O
Do O
you O
all O
use O
those O
multiple O
compartment O
trunk O
dividers? O
Any O

be O
greatly O

are O
usually O
in O

with O
one O

you. O
It's O
much O
easier O
to O
keep O
them O
separated O
(one O
in O
the O

one O
inside O

The O

are O
not O

Curbside O
grocery O
picks O
are O
always O
only O
1 O

2 O

Thats O
why O
when O

the O
bigger O
on O
goes O
in O
the O

one O
in O

into O

None O

have O
had O

with O
this, O
so O
far. O
I O
can O
see O
they O
mark O
one O
order O
for O
the O
trunk O

one O
for O

on O

For O

if O

eight O

I O
actually O
alphabetize O
them O
in O
my O
trunk/cargo O

after O
the O

has O
finished. O
Makes O
it O
super O
easy O

grab O
the O
one O
I O
want O

if O
somebody O
has O

hunt O

As O
far O
as O
the O
crap O
in O
your O
backseat, O
you O
need O
to O
take O
it O
out O
when O
you're O
sparking. O
The O
loaders O
have O
good O
reason O
to O
not O
want O
to O
put O
other O
people's O
groceries O
in O
with O
your O
stuff, O
because O
of O
hygiene O
concerns O
and O
also O
because O
they O
don't O
want O
it O
getting O
lost O
in O
the O

All O
my O

goes O
in O
the O
front O
passenger O

[SEP]
Thank O
you. O
My O
back O
seat O
I O
had O
a O
carseat O
and O
all O
my O
"delivery"/reusable O
grocery O
bags O
that O
I O
normally O
keep O
in O
my O
trunk O
but O
wanted O
out O
of O
the O
way O
for O
the O
orders. O
I O
did O
that O
because O
I O
had O
read O
on O
another O
post O
how O
a O
loader O
complained O
about O
stuff O
being O
the O
a O
drivers O
trunk, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
like O
a O
crate O
of O
necessities O
in O
a O
car- O
jumper O
cables, O
etc. O
So O
because O
of O
that, O
I O
didn't O
think O
putting O
an O
order O
in O
the O
back O
seat O
would O
be O
"approved" O
with O
my O
personal O
items O
there. O
But O
I O
appreciate O
your O
info, O
thank O
you. O
It O

Ok, O
That O
makes O
sense, O
I O
have O
seen O
some O
white O
with O
yellow O
packaging O
that O
resembled O
the O
Amazon O
gray O
plastic O
bags. O
I O
am O
assuming O
that O
is O
what O
you O
mean O
as O
packed O
like O
Amazon. O
Then O
each O
on O
of O
those O
packages O
has O
its O
own O
sticker O
even O
if O
you O
have O
multiple O
ones O
going O
to O
the O
same O
address? O
This O
makes O
more O

in O
my O

now. O
I O
had O
been O
scared O

accepting O
any O
and O

how O
it O

So O
sick O
all O
the O
time. O
[SEP]
I O
JUST O
started O
this O
job O
at O
a O
daycare. O
I'm B-Occupation
a I-Occupation
floater/assistant I-Occupation
I've O
been O
working O
with O
the O
babies O
and O
it O
seems O
that O
this O
is O
the O
season O
for O
everyone O
to O
be O
sick. O
The O
problem O
is, O
I'm O
also O
getting O
sick. O
Ive O
only O
been O
there O
for O
three O
weeks O
and O
each O
week O
I've O
actually O
caught O
what O
the O
babies O
had. O
First O
two O
weeks O
I O
had O
a O
fever O
for O
a O
few O
days O
and O
now O
I've O
caught O
the O
stomach O
bug. O
I O
havent O
stopped O
throwing O
up O
for O
two O
days O
and O
could O
barely O
see O
straight. O
I've O
finally O
caught O
my O
breath O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
it O
has O
me O
thinking O
a O
lot. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Is O
this O
job O
even O
worth O
it? O
I O
love O
the O
babies O
dearly O
already O
and O
my O
coworkers O
think O
I'm O
a O
great O
team O
player. O
I O
just O
can't O
believe O
I've O
been O
this O
sick O
already O
and O
I O
feel O
so O
freaking O
guilty O
not O
being O
there. O
They're O
understanding O
but O
how O
understanding O
are O
they O
going O
to O
be? O
I O
just O
want O
some O
second O
opinions. O
Is O
it O
worth O
waiting O
for O
my O
immune O
system O
to O
toughen O
up? O
I'm O
thinking O
I O
should O
just O
quit O
at O
this O
point, O
I O
can't O
keep O
getting O
sick O
and O
I O
can't O
keep O
calling O
out O
and O
leaving O
people O
hanging. O
[SEP]
So, O
I O
think O
it's O
a O
misconception/myth O
that O
your O
"immune O
system O
gets O
stronger" O
the O
more O
you O
work O
with O
children. O
While O
it's O
true O
that O
your O
body O
will O
develop O
antibodies O
whenever O
it's O
exposed O
to O
a O
virus O
(like O
the O
cold O
or O
flu), O
there O
are O
hundreds O
upon O
hundreds O
of O
viruses O
that O
effect O
humans, O
that O
the O
likelihood O
of O
becoming O
immune O
to O
all O
of O
them O
is O
low. O
And O
everyone's O
immune O
response O
is O
going O
to O
be O
different O
-- O
if O
you're O
immune O
compromised, O
being O
exposed O
to O
more O
viruses O
can O
actually O
be O
harmful. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
To O
answer O
your O
question O
-- O
I O
don't O
know. O
But O
from O
my O
experience, O
you O
don't O
stop O
getting O
sick. O
Some O
viruses O
may O
be O
less O
intense O
than O
others, O
but O
after O
13+ O
years, O
I'm O
still O
getting O
sick. O
The O
only O
thing O
that O
has O
prevented O
illness O
is O
wearing O
a O
mask O
for O
me. O
So O
after O
4 O
different O
bouts O
of O
illness O
this O
school O
year, O
I've O
put O
my O
mask O
back O
on O
so O
that O
I O
can O
enjoy O
the O
holidays O
with O
my O
family. O

How's O
the O
culture O
around O
masking O
where O
you O
work? O
I've O
gone O
back O
to O
wearing O
them O
after O
getting O
really O
sick O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
a O
couple O
years. O
I'll O
probably O
wear O
it O
for O
cold O
and O
flu O
season O
then O
drop O
them O
again O
when O
things O
get O
better. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
also O
found O
the O
younger O
the O
kids O
I O
work O
with O
the O
more O
often O
I O
get O
sick. O
Babies O
are O
literally O
on O
you O
all O
the O
time, O
not O
to O
mention O
having O
to O
wipe O
their O
noses O
all O
day. O
I O
stopped O
getting O
as O
sick O
when O
I O
started O
working O
with O
an O
older O
age O
group O
so O
maybe O
keep O
that O
in O
mind O
for O
down O
the O
road? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
do O
feel O
you O
though, O
I O
got O
pneumonia O
TWICE O
the O
first O
year O
I B-Occupation
worked I-Occupation
in I-Occupation
ECE. I-Occupation
It O
does O
get O
better O
but O
you'll O
never O
dodge O
illness O
completely O
on O
our O
field. O
[SEP]
Do O
you O
wear O
a O
mask O
at O
work? O
I O
also O
work O
with O
infants O
and O
wearing O
a O
mask O
has O
I O
think O
prevented O
me O
from O
getting O
sick O
so O
far. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
haven’t O
worked O
without O
one; O
so O
not O
sure O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
I O
didn’t, O
I O
assume O
I’d O
be O
getting O
sick. O
[SEP]
I O
literally O
came O
back O
to O
this O
sub O
just O
to O
see O
if O
anyone O
else O
was O
struggling O
with O
this. O
I O
am O
sick O
again O
for O
the O
fifth O
or O
sixth O
time O
within O
the O
span O
of O
like O
two O
months O
and O
it’s O
EXHAUSTING. O
The O
fact O
that O
if O
you O
were O
to O
take O
time O
off O
every O
time O
you O
got O
sick, O
you’d O
barely O
be O
there, O
makes O
it O
some O
much O
more O
frustrating. O
It’s O
like O
you O
have O
to O
wait O
until O
you’re O
actually O
incapable O
of O
functioning O
to O
take O
a O
single O
day O
off. O
I O
adore O
the O
kids O
i O
work O
with O
too O
so O
I O
don’t O
think O
I O
could O
bring O
myself O
to O
leave, O
but O
every O
time O
I O
feel O
that O
sore O
throat O
coming O
on, O
I O
definitely O
rethink O
it O
for O
a O
minute. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day, O
we’ve O
all O
got O
to O
take O
care O
of O
our O
health. O
A O
coworker O
of O
mine O
left O
suddenly O
without O
giving O
notice O
because O
she O
kept O
getting O
sick O
too. O
It O
just O
depends O
on O
how O
you O
feel O
and O
if O
you O
and O
your O
health O
can O
handle O
it O
all. O

a O

Me O

were O

together. O
We O
constantly O
were O
on O
facetime, O
hung O
out O
near O
to O
every O
day O
and O
NEVER O
had O
a O
falling O
out. O
[SEP]
In O
october O
2021 O
Rachel O
met O
her O
boyfriend O
i O
will O
be O
calling O
Kyle O
(m17). B-Age_Gender
Kyle O
never O
liked O
me O
very O
much O
but O
we O
still O
managed O
to O
be O
civil O
and O
would O
speak O
on O
nights O
out. O
In O
november O
2021 O
Rachel O
sent O
a O
picture O
to O
Kyle O
of O
me O
slapping O
her O
ass. O
I O
would O
like O
to O
preference O
this O
by O
saying O
i B-Sexual_Orientation
am I-Sexual_Orientation
gay I-Sexual_Orientation
and O
she O
told O
me O
to O
do O
it O
as O
it O
would O
be O
funny. O
After O
this O
we O
got O
dressed O
and O
went O
to O
a O
party O
not O
checking O
our O
phones. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
we O
both O
checked O
our O
phones O
to O
see O
Kyle O
had O
text O
both O
of O
us O
giving O
out O
and O
being O
quite O
agressive, O
Rachel O
crying O
and O
me, O
being O
drunk, O
sent O
him O
a O
voice O
message O
explaining O
i O
don’t O
understand O
why O
he O
is O
so O
angry O
at O
us O
seeing O
as O
i’m B-Sexual_Orientation
gay I-Sexual_Orientation
and O
have O
been O
friends O
with O
Rachel O
for O
4 O
years O
and O
have O
always O
done O
stupid O
stuff O
like O
this O
and O
have O
never O
had O
any O
relationship O
(even O
before O
coming O
out). O
Kyle O
finally O
calmed O
down O
a O
few O
weeks O
later O
and O
it O
was O
all O
ok O
again. O
[SEP]
This O
past O
March O
me, O
Kyle O
and O
Rachel O
went O
to O
a O
bar O
with O
a O
few O
of O
our O
friends O
for O
drinks. O
The O
night O
went O
well O
and O
no O
drama O
happened O
the O
whole O
night. O
As O
i O
was O
leaving O
i O
hugged O
Rachel O
goodbye O
and O
left O
with O
Kyle O
and O
a O
few O
of O
our O
mutual O
friends O
to O
go O
home. O
Kyle O
never O
said O
anything O
to O
me O
and O
it O
all O
seemed O
ok. O
the O
next O
morning O
i O
woke O
up O
to O
being O
given O
out O
to O
by O
both O
Kyle O
And O
Rachel O
for O
trying O
to O
get O
in O
between O
them. O
i O
obviously O
confused O
said O
i O
didn’t O
no O
what O
they O
ment O
yet O
they O
both O
blocked O
me O
and O
he O
was O
threatening O
to O
beat O
me O
up O
[SEP]
me O
and O
Rachel O
stopped O
talking O
for O
a O
few O
months O
and O
i O
was O
devestated O
because O
i O
lost O
my O
best O
friend. O
[SEP]
2 O
months O
ago O
Kyle O
and O
Rachel O
broke O
up. O
She O
rang O
me O
crying O
over O
it O
and O
i O
cheered O
her O
up. O
Later O
that O
day O
while O
hanging O
out O
with O
friends O
i O
saw O
that O
Rachel O
had O
added O
me O
on O
snapchat O
and O
we O
started O
talking O
as O
we O
used O
to. O
[SEP]
4 O
days O
later O
Rachel O

Kyle O
got O
back O
together O
but O
Rachel O
promised O
she O
would O
tell O
Kyle O
to O
be O
nice O
to O
me O
and O
we O
will O
continue O
to O
be O

[SEP]
last O
week O
i O
saw O
that O
Rachel O
had O
blocked O
me O
on O
snapchat O
for O
no O
apparent O
reason. O
i O
confronted O
her O
about O
it O
and O
she O
said O
her O
phone O
must O
have O
glitched. O
she O
added O
me O
back O
but O
about O
2 O
hours O
later O
she O
had O
blocked O
me O
again. O
The O
next O
day O
at O
school O
i O
asked O
her O
again O
if O
it O
was O
Kyles O
fault O
i O
was O
blocked O
again O
and O
she O
immediately O
got O
defensive, O
she O
said O
the O
reason O
she O
blocked O
me O
is O
because O
i O
was O
annoying O
and O
a O
bitch. O
this O
set O
me O
off O
and O
i O
blew O
up O
at O
her O
for O
still O
[SEP]
being O
with O
Kyle O
and O
being O
to O
pussy O
to O
stand O
up O
for O
herself. O
i O
told O
everyone O
about O
how O
toxic O
she O
had O
been O
and O
then O
leaked O
all O
our O
chats O
of O
her O
being O
rude O
and O
a O
video O
of O
her O
and O
Kyle O
making O
out. O
Everyone O
laughed O
about O
it O
and O
everyone O
is O
saying O
i’m O
in O
the O
right O
except O
my O
group, O
they O
are O
saying O
i’m O
being O

to O
reach O
a O
goal O
weight, O
I O
have O
a O
ton O
of O
NSVs O
I O
can't O
wait O
to O
check O
off, O
but O
reaching O
a O
certain O
weight O
isn't O
one O
of O
them. O
Is O
this O
normal? O
The O
more O
I O
think O
about O
it, O
the O
more O
it's O
bothering O
me. O
Everyone O
on O
here O
seems O
so O
excited O
to O
reach O
onederland, O
should O
I O
be O
looking O
forward O
to O
that? O
If O
I O
don't O
have O
a O
goal O
weight O
and O
honestly O
tell O
that O
to O
my O
psychologist, O
will O
that O
be O
a O
reason O
to O
not O
approve O
me O
or O
something? O
Should O
I O
put O
a O
number O
and O
just O
keep O
my O
NSV O
list O
to O
myself? O
[SEP]
I O
just O
want O
to O
feel O
better O
about O
myself. O
Put O
on O
jeans O
that O
fit O
(everywhere)... O
Go O
bike O
riding O
with O
my O
son. O
Overall, O
I O
want O
to O
teach O
him O
better O
food O
and O
exercise O
habits. O
I O
know O
these O
are O
good O
things, O
but O
it's O
okay O
for O
these O
to O
be O
my O
goals, O
right? O
Not, O
just O
a O
number...? O
[SEP]
I O
sure O
hope O
it’s O
normal O
because O
I O
definitely O
don’t O
have O
a O
number O
in O
mind. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
thought O
is O
that O
I’m O
going O
to O
do O
what O
I O
can O
to O
take O
care O
of O
myself O
as O
best O
I O
can. O
I’m O
going O
to O
lose O
weight O
in O
that O
process, O
but O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
much O
or O
when O
that O
weight O
will O
come O
off. O
In O
fact, O
it’s O
impossible O
for O
any O
of O
us O
to O
know. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
what O
they’re O
looking O
for O
on O
some O
form O
is O
that O
your O
number O
is O
realistic. O
Do O
you O
weigh O
293 O
pounds O
and O
want O
to O
get O
down O
to O
95? O
That’s O
probably O
not O
realistic O
or O
healthy. O
[SEP]
My O
goal O
weight O
is O
fitting O
on O
a O
rollercoaster. O
I O
don’t O
have O
a O
weight O
in O
mind, O
but O
my O
ideal O
size O
is O
a O
size O
12/14. O
But O
I’d O
be O
happy O
at O
a O
16 O
as O
well. O
I O
have O
large O
hips O
that O
I O
want O
to O
keep. O
[SEP]
I O
only O
have O
a O
number O
goal O
because O
there O
is O
a O
weight O
limit O
to O
sky O
diving O
[SEP]
I'm O
kind O
of O
in O
the O
same O
boat. O
If O
I O
can O
get O
under O
300, O
I'll O
be O
thrilled. O
But O
a O
number O
isn't O
really O
what O
I'm O
shooting O
for. O
I O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
fly O
on O
a O
plane O
without O
a O
seatbelt O
extender. O
I O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
shop O
for O
clothes O
somewhere O
other O
than O
the O
Big O
& O
Tall O
stores. O
I O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
climb O
more O
than O
two O
flights O
of O
stairs O
without O
needing O
to O
stop O
for O
breath. O
I O
guess O
the O
goal O
weight O
is O
just O
more O
of O
a O
concrete O
victory O
to O
strive O
for, O
but O
all O
the O
other O
little O
things O
are O
going O
to O
mean O
far O
more O
to O
me O
as O
they O
happen. O
[SEP]
I O
never O
had O
a O
goal O
weight O
either O
and O
really O
believe O
that O
is O
the O
healthier O
approach. O
I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
I O
want O
to O
do O
to O
enjoy O
the O
full O
capabilities O
of O
my O
body O
that O
only O
weightloss O
will O
provide, O
but O
saying O
I O
want O
to O
weigh O
120 O
and O
be O
a O
size O
4 O
is O
not O
an O
approach O
that O
I O
am O
willing O
to O
take. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
you O
should O
have O
a O
preliminary O
goal O
(like O
losing O
70% O
of O
excess O
weight) O
but O
I O
don’t O
think O
anyone O
can O
have O
a O
final O
goal O
because O
most O
of O
us O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
it O
would O
be O
because O
we’ve O
been O
so O
far O
away O
for O
most O
or O
all O
of O
our O
adult O
lives. O
My O
preliminary O
goal O
is O
to O
lose O
the O
excess O
then O
I’ll O
reassess. O
I O
want O
to O
get O
to O
a O
lifestyle O
that O
has O
balance O
and O
isn’t O
all O
or O
nothing. O
[SEP]
I O
hope O
it's O
normal O
because O
I O
don't O
either O
lol. O
[SEP]
I B-Appearance
was I-Appearance
200 I-Appearance
lbs I-Appearance
at B-Age
10 I-Age
years I-Age
old, I-Age
so O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
adult O
me O
is O
supposed O
to O
weigh O
or O
what O
is O
realistic. O
[SEP]
I O
agree O
with O
everyone O
else, O
I O
think O
it's O
more O
about O
having O
a O
healthy O
goal. O
[SEP]
I O
loved O
going O
based O
on O
NSV O
as O
opposed O
to O
an O
overall O
end O
goal. O
I O
also O
don’t O
have O
a O
number O
and O
my O
surgeon O
didn’t O
either. O
He O
cares O
about O
my O
overall O
health. O
I O
am O
almost O
2 O
years O
post O
op O
and O
at O
my O
18 O
month O
Check O
up O
he O
said O
to O
match O
the O
BMI O
range O
I’d O
have O
to O
lose O
20 O
more O
pounds O
but O
he O
doesn’t O
care O
about O
that. O
He O
is O
so O
happy O
with O
my O
progress O
and O
now O
wants O
me O
focusing O
on O
building O
muscle O
for O
better O
overall O
health. O
So O
I O
have O
no O
actual O
stated O
goal O
weight O
from O
my O
surgeon O
and O
I O
have O
never O
really O
cared O
about O
one. O
I B-Appearance
started I-Appearance
this I-Appearance
journey I-Appearance
at I-Appearance
314+ I-Appearance
pounds I-Appearance
and I-Appearance
am I-Appearance
hovering I-Appearance
around I-Appearance
175 I-Appearance
right I-Appearance
now I-Appearance
so O
I’m O
just O
pleased O
overall! O
I O
love O
not O
having O
a O
goal O
weight. O
[SEP]
My O
surgeon O
asked O
me O
what O
my O
goal O
weight O
was, O
on O
my O
1 O
year O
anniversary. O
I O
straight O
up O
told O
him O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
be O
defined O
by O
a O
number. O
I O
can O
walk O
without O
a O
cane, O
do O
stuff O
without O
being O
out O
of O
breath. O
That O
is O
my O
goal. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Plus O
I O
really O
hate O
buying O
clothes O
lol. O
[SEP]
Eh O
I O
don’t O
have O
a O
hard O
number. O
I O
had O
a O
loose O
one O
where O
I O
hit O
milestones O
with O
each O
birth/pregnancy O
of O
my O
kids. O
So O
far O
I’m O
down O
to O
birth O
of O
2nd O
kid. O
Still O
need O
to O
work O
down O
to O
1st O
kid. O
If O
I O
get O
that O
far O
maybe O
weight O
at O
enlistment? O
[SEP]
The O
only O
numerical O
goal O
I O
have O
is O
to O
get O
into O
the O
100's O
again, O
but O
I O
don't O
have O
a O
goal O
weight. O
I O
think O
wanting O
to O
be O
and O
live O
healthy, O
and O
feel O
better, O
is O
a O
good O
enough O
goal. O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
have O
a O
weight O
goal. O
A O
few O
years O
ago O
I O
managed O
to O
lose O
50 O
lbs. O
Played O
the O
best O
golf O
of O
my O
life O
that O
summer, O
then O
gained O
it O
back. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
walk O
18 O
with O
my O
son O
with O
no O
foot, O
knee O
or O
back O
pain O
and O
maybe O
even O
be O
able O
to O
beat O
him O
on O
occasion. O
[SEP]
I O
think O
you O
have O
a O
very O
healthy O
perspective. O
[SEP]
My O
consultant O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
had O
any O
more O
questions O
and O
then O
said O
oh O
you O
should O
loose O
about O
85kg, O
most O
people O
ask O
that O
question, O
I O
didn't O
know O
hiw O
much O
that O
was O
( O
from O
UK O
and O
use O
stones O
and O
lbs) O
but O
smiled O
and O
said O
great O
[SEP]
I O
never O
wrote O
down O
or O
spoke O
a O
goal O
weight O
because O
I O
mentally O
did O
not O
want O
to O
put O
pressure O
on O
myself O
or O
end O
up O
feeling O
failure O
if O
I O
did O
not O
get O
there. O
I O
know O
there O
is O
a O
weight O
above O
an O
ideal O
weight O
that O
I O
would O
be O
comfortable O
and O
healthier O
at. O
Would O
I O
like O
to O
get O
to O
my O
ideal O
weight O
sure O
but O
I O
focused O
more O
on O
following O
a O
healthier O
eating O
and O
lifestyle O
and O
let O
the O
results O
be O
what O
they O
are. O
I O
had O
also O
read O
that O
on O
average O
people O
lose O
a O
percentage O
of O
their O
“excess” O
weight. O
Something O
like O
75 O
percent. O
But O
anyway O
the O
inverse O
of O
that O
is O
that O
people O
still O
keep O
a O
percentage O
of O
their O
excess O
weight O
so O
I O
didn’t O
want O
to O
create O
an O
unrealistic O
scenario O
that O
would O
trigger O
me O
to O
feel O
as O
though O
I O
failed O
[SEP]
Also O
don't O
have O
one O
but O
a O
ton O
of O
different O
goals. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
have O
an O
end O
goal… O
I O
have O
“little” O
goals O
along O
the O
way… O
I’m O
down O
160 O
lbs O
and O
about O
10 O
lbs O
away O
from O
actually O
being O
what O
my O
driver’s O
license O
says O
I O
weight… O
that O
was O
a O
goal O
for O
me. O
I O
also O
want O
to O
weigh O
less O
than O
my O
husband O
(about O
50 O
lbs O
away O
right O
now). O
But O
my O
next O
dr O
visit O
I O
plan O
on O
asking O
what O
a O
realistic O
goal O
weight O
for O
me O
will O
be O
because O
I O
know O
I’m O
gonna O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
excess O
skin O
weight. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
have O
a O
goal O
weight. O
My O
goals O
are O
to O
bring O
my O
blood O
sugar O
levels O
down, O
I’m O
a O
type O
2 O
diabetic, O
and O
just O
overall O
have O
a O
more O
healthy O
body. O
[SEP]
My O
take O
on O
that O
question O
(goal O
weight) O
is O
that O
they O
want O
to O
be O
sure O
your O
aim O
isn’t O
unreasonable. O
Imagine O
putting O
down O
a O
number O
so O
low O
that, O
for O
an O
person O
who’s O
never O
dealt O
with O
weight O
issues, O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
achieve. O
I O
think O
it’s O
fair O
to O
say O
“I’d O
expect O
to O
feel O
comfortable O
in O
my O
body O
at O
X O
weight, O
but O
what O
my O
real O
goal O
is O
to O
ride O
a O
bike O
without O
my O
joints O
hurting, O
be O
able O
to O
play O
with O
my O
kids O
without O
being O
too O
out O
of O
breadth, O
etc.” O
As O
everyone O
alludes O
to O
- O
it’s O
a O
major O
mental O
challenge, O
so O
you’re O
head O
has O
to O
be O
in O
a O
reasonable O
space. O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
have O
a O
goal O
weight O
and O
never O
have. O
Told O
my O
surgeon, O
my O
nutritionist, O
my O
psychologist, O
everyone, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
fine O
with O
it. O
[SEP]
It's O
pretty O
simple, O
find O
the O
weight O
that O
puts O
you O
in O
the O
healthy O
BMI O
range O
..there's O
the O
goal. O
[SEP]
For O
sure O
normal! O
I O
didn’t O
have O
one O
at O
first O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
feel O
better O
and O
fit O
in O
clothes O
I O
liked. O
Then O
I O
got O
under O
200 O
and O
was O
like O
hey O
170 O
sounds O
like O
a O
good O
place O
cause O
it’s O
a O
“normal” O
BMI O
weight O
for O
my O
height. O
Now O
I’m O
under O
170 O
and O
I’m O
like O
hey O
150 O
would O
be O
cool! O
Who O
knows O
if O
I’ll O
have O
a O
new O
one O
at O
150 O
when O
I O
get O
there. O
Just O
going O
with O
the O
flow O
and O
what O
feels O
good O
for O
my O
body. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
it O
can O
also O
be O
discouraging O
in O
the O
beginning O
to O
have O
a O
“goal” O
cause O
it O
seems O
so O
far O
away, O
hundreds O
of O
pounds O
away O
and O
before O
surgery O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
like O
I’ll O
never O
get O
there O
so O
why O
even O
try. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
have O
a O
goal O
weight O
either, O
but O
if O
I O
can O
get O
down O
close O
to O
200lbs O
I’ll O
be O
happy. O
My O
“healthy” O
weight O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
134 O
and O
I O
don’t O
think O
that’s O
realistic O
for O
me, O
so O
my O
dad O
and O
I O
agree O
that O
we O
hope O
I O
can O
get O
down O
to O
200 O
at O
least. O
Doctor O
never O
mentioned O
a O
goal O
weight O
for O
me O
though O
[SEP]
I O
never O
really O
had O
a O
goal O
weight, O
but O
a O
goal O
range. O
I O
am O
now O
in O
that O
range O
and O
just O
work O
maintaining O
that O
3-5 O
pound O
range. O
[SEP]
So O
if O
they O
need O
a O
definitive O
answer O
look O
up O
the O
weight O
for O
the O
ideal O
bike O
u O
want O
to O
ride O
or O
the O
weight O
of O
a O
typical O
person O
who O
wears O
whatever O
size O
jeans O
u O
want O
to O
get O
into? O
[SEP]
Yeah O
the O
scale O
number O
is O
not O
everything. O
BMI O
is O
also O
not O
really O
a O
good O
indicator, O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
also O
building O
muscle. O
I O
don’t O
have O
a O
weight O
goal, O
but O
more O
of O
a O
weight O
“range” O
because O
I O
know O
that O
I’m O
building O
muscle O
in O
the O
process O
and O
muscle O
weighs O
more O
than O
fat. O
Someone O
could O
look O
really O
fit O
and O
have O
muscle O
on O
them O
and O
the O
bmi O
calculator O
will O
tell O
them O
that O
they’re O
overweight O
lol. O
Body O
fat O
percentage O
is O
probably O
a O
better O
measure… O
[SEP]
My O
goal O
weight O
is O
to O
get O
down O
to O
wearing O
2XL O
shirts O
again, O
don't O
know O
what O
number O
that'll O
be O
for O
me. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
have O
a O
goal O
weight, O
either. O
I O
think O
I’ll O
know O
it O
when O
I O
get O
there O
n O
[SEP]
Echoing O
other O
responses. O
I O
just O
kind O
of O
guessed O
based O
on O
what O
I O
think O
I O
may O
have O
weighed O
at O
a O
reasonable O
place O
in O
history. O
I O
emphasized O
to O
my O
surgeon O
I O
was O
more O
interested O
in O
certain O
activities, O
not O
a O
weight. O
I O
care O
more O
about O
body O
composition O
than O
scale. O
Guess O
those O
were O
acceptable O
answers! O
Haha O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Good O
luck! O
:) O
[SEP]
Is O
it O
normal… O
absolutely. O
Everyone O
should O
have O
a O
goal O
but O
it’s O
not O
necessary. O
Your O
doctor/surgen/ O
primary O
provider O
can O
set O
one O
for O
you O
but O
it’s O
up O
to O
you O
to O
decide O
whether O
it O
works O
for O
you O
or O
you O
go O
beyond O
that. O
Either O
way, O
trust O
the O
process O
and O
you O
will O
be O
successful O
[SEP]
I O
just O
said O
154 O
because O
that’s O
the O
weight O
that O
put O
me O
at O
“normal” O
bmi. O
I O
just O
want O
to O
be O
healthy O
and O
able O
to O
do O
stuff O
with O
my O
family. O
50 O
pounds O
down O
at O

just O
at O

more I-Appearance
weight I-Appearance
and I-Appearance
tipped I-Appearance
at I-Appearance
296. I-Appearance
it O
was O
a O
wake O
up O
call O
for O
me. O
when O
i O
saw O
the O
doctor O
i O
was O
286. O
goal O
weight O
for O
surgery O
was O
271. O
made O
it. O
had O
surgery O
oct. O
19 O
2022. O
now O
im O
232. O
what O
pushed O
me O
to O
have O
this O
surgery O
was O
that O
i O
wanted O
to O
be O
a O
better O
me, O
for O
myself, O
my O
husband, O
and O
my O
daughter. O
i O
want O
to O
be O
at O
a O
healthy O
bmi O
so O
i O
can O
live O
longer O
since O
i O
already O
have O
health O
issues, O
i O
also O
want O
to O
have O
a O
healthy O
pregnancy O
when O
it O
comes O
time O
for O
the O
2nd O
baby. O
:) O
i O
have O
multiple O
goals, O
first O
goal O
is O
to O
get O
under O
200lb. O
i O
would O
be O
thrilled. O
2nd O
goal O
is O
healthy O
bmi O
which O
is O
150-160lb. O
if O
you O
dont O
have O
a O
goal O
in O
mind O
thats O
fine, O
just O
strive O
to O
be O
a O
better O
and O
healthier O
you O
:) O
[SEP]
I O
didn't O
have O
a O
goal O
weight. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Honestly, O
I O
thought O
this O
surgery O
would O
be O
just O
another O
thing O
that O
didn't O
work O
for O
me, O
so O
even O
if O
I O
put O
in O
the O
work O
(and O
I O
did O
do O
the O
work) O
- O
I O
just O
didn't O
want O
to O
be O
let O
down O
when O
the O
weight O
didn't O
drop O
like O
everything O
else O
I O
had O
tried. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I've O
been O
pleasantly O
surprise O
and O
have O
lost O
over O
100 O
lbs O
9 O
months O
out. O
[SEP]
I O
sure O
hope O
it’s O
normal O
because O
I O
definitely O
don’t O
have O
a O
number O
in O
mind. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
thought O
is O
that O
I’m O
going O
to O
do O
what O
I O
can O
to O
take O
care O
of O
myself O
as O
best O
I O
can. O
I’m O
going O
to O
lose O
weight O
in O
that O
process, O
but O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
much O
or O
when O
that O
weight O
will O
come O
off. O
In O
fact, O
it’s O
impossible O
for O
any O
of O
us O
to O
know. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
what O
they’re O
looking O
for O
on O
some O
form O
is O
that O
your O
number O
is O
realistic. O
Do O
you O
weigh O
293 O
pounds O
and O
want O
to O
get O
down O
to O
95? O
That’s O
probably O
not O
realistic O
or O
healthy. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
That O
definitely O
makes O
sense O
now! O
[SEP]
I O
love O
this! O
I O
haven't O
even O
thought O
about O
it, O
but O
riding O
a O
roller O
coaster O
again O
sounds O
like O
an O
amazing O
goal. O
I'm O
definitely O
adding O
that O
to O
my O
list O
now! O
I O
used O
to O
live O
going O
to O
amusement O
parks, O
but O
hell, O
being O
big O
and O
overweight O
walking O
in O
those O
parks O
is O
no O
joke! O
Ahhhh, O
I'm O
excited O
all O
over O
again O
to O
do O
this! O
Thank O
you! O
[SEP]
I've O
never O
been! O
I've O
been O
scuba O
diving, O
but O
never O
sky O
diving! O
I O
might O
have O
to O
look O
into O
this! O
[SEP]
I O
agree, O
the O
other O
little O
things O
I O
hope O
are O
going O
to O
be O
so O
much O
more O
worth O
it O
when O
I O
reach O
them! O
[SEP]
It O
helps O
knowing O
I'm O
not O
the O
only O
one! O
Thank O
you! O
[SEP]
Same. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
want O
this O
weight O
loss O
journey O
to O
be O
100% O
diff O
than O
all O
others O
I’ve O
been O
down O
before. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
not O
going O
to O
weigh O
for O
40 O
days. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Working O
with O
a O
therapist O
and O
dietician O
to O
change O
my O
thought O
patterns O
around O
weight O
and O
numbers O
etc. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Best O
of O
luck O
to O
us O
all. O
[SEP]
That's O
my O
thoughts O
now! O
I O
am O
looking O
at O
a O
healthy O
weight O
based O
on O
my O
height, O
and O
I O
just O
can't O
imagine O
being O
that O
little! O
Hell, O
I O
don't O
think O
I've O
ever O
been O
that O
small. O
I'm O
pretty O
sure O
I O
just O
sailed O
right O
over O
that O
healthy O
range O
into O
being O
over. O
[SEP]
I'm O
in O
this O
boat. O
Overweight O
my O
entire O
life. O
No O
specific O
goal O
in O
my O
head. O
It O
just O
seems O
unrealistic O
[SEP]
Thank O
you. O
It's O
hard O
to O
imagine O
reaching O
other O
goals O
I've O
set O
for O
myself. O
[SEP]
I O
love O
this. O
Reading O
the O
goal O
weight O
for O
my O
height O
feels O
almost O
unreal! O
[SEP]
I O
know, O
I'm O
excited O
to O
for O
into O
jeans O
comfortably, O
but O
that O
definitely O
doesn't O
mean O
I'll O
enjoy O
going O
to O
buy O
them O
lol O
[SEP]
That's O
a O
great O
way O
to O
look O
at O
it. O
I'd O
love O
to O
be O
what O
I O
was O
before O
I O
had O
my O
son... O
you O
know, O
back O
when O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
sooo O
fat. O
🙄 O
[SEP]
I O
like O
how O
you O
said O
that, O
just O
a O
general O
goal O
number O
range. O
I O
think O
I O
might O
put O
something O
like O
that! O
I'm O
scouring O
over O
what O
is O
considered O
a O
healthy O
5 O
based O
on O
my O
height. O
Tbh, O
they O
so O
sound O
so O
little. O
I O
can't O
imagine O
ever O
being O
that O
tiny! O
[SEP]
My O
main O
diving O
force O
is O
to O
spend O
more O
quality O
active O
time O
with O
my O
son. O
I O
can't O
wait O
to O
feel O
good O
while O
doing O
activities O
with O
him, O
again. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
More O
often O
than O
not, O
I O
see O
number O
weight O
posts O
on O
here, O
and O
I'm O
truly O
excited O
for O
others, O
but O
when O
asked O
directly O
about O
mine... O
I O
panicked. O
[SEP]
Other O
than O
telling O
me O
I O
can't O
gain O
weight O
while O
in O
the O
program, O
numbers O
haven't O
really O
been O
discussed O
with O
my O
doctor. O
[SEP]
Wow. O
That's O
really O
deep, O
fam. O
Never O
would've O
thought O
as O
it O
being O
that O
way, O
either. O
I O
would O
definitely O
be O
in O
the O
group O
to O
label O
myself O
as O
a O
failure, O
if O
I O
didn't O
reach O
the O
goal. O
[SEP]
Have O
you O
had O
your O
surgery O
yet? O
[SEP]
Even O
while O
reading O
all O
these O
it O
never O
occurred O
to O
me O
to O
ask O
my O
doctor.. O
duh! O
[SEP]
That's O
it! O
I O
just O
want O
to O
be O
healthy. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
I O
know O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
mental O
undertaking O
that O
I'm O
sure O
I O
won't O
fully O
understand O
until O
I'm O
there O
and O
in O
the O
thick O
of O
it. O
[SEP]
This O
makes O
me O
feel O
so O
much O
better! O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
my O
healthy O
weight O
starts O
in O
the O
double O
digits O
for O
my O
height O
and O
ends O
around O
125... O
I O
can't O
imagine. O
[SEP]
How O
did O
you O
come O
up O
with O
your O
range? O
[SEP]
I O
just O
want O
to O
fit O
into O
jeans O
that O
are O
comfortable O
all O
over! O
[SEP]
This O
never O
crossed O
my O
mind O
when O
it O
should O
have, O
thank O
you O
for O
the O
tip! O
I O
definitely O
want O
to O
get O
back O
into O
weight O
lifting, O
like O
I O
did O
some O
in O
high O
school. O
[SEP]
I O
just O
want O
jeans O
that O
aren't O
huge O
at O
my O
feet O
and O
too O
tight O
at O
my O
waist. O
Or O
maybe O
a O
comfortable O
pair O
that O
aren't O
spandex! O
[SEP]
I O
feel O
like O
this O
is O
me! O
I O
have O
so O
many O
little O
things O
that O
I O
think O
I'll O
notice, O
I'm O
hoping O
I O
just O
reach O
a O
point O
where O
I'm O
just O
not O
tired. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
I'm O
just O
so O
ready O
for O
the O
surgery O
or O
even O
to O
get O
a O
date O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
mess O
anything O
up! O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
I'm O
certainly O
excited O
to O
trust O
the O
process, O
just O
this O
waiting... O
[SEP]
I O
just O
can't O
imagine O
being O
as O
small O
as O
what O
my O
"normal" O
says! O
I O
know O
it's O
possible, O
just O
hard O
to O
imagine. O
[SEP]
I O
love O
reading O
other O
people's O
NSV, O
especially O
ones O
like O
this! O
[SEP]
That's O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
my O
mindset. O
I O
don't O
want O
this O
to O
be O
another O
letdown O
in O
my O
life. O
I O
have O
NSVs O
I O
want O
to O
obtain, O
but O
my O
heart O
just O
isn't O
going O
to O
be O
set O
until O
they O
happen. O
I O
hope O
the O
work O
I O
put O
in O
pays O
off, O
just O
how O
it O
appears O
everyone O
else's O
has O
that O
I've O
seen O
on O
here! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Congratulations O
on O
your O
100lbs! O
Dropping O
that O
much O
will O
put O
me O
in O
my O
healthy O
BMI O
range, O
and O
that O
would O
be O
amazing! O
[SEP]
You’re O
welcome! O
I O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
went O
to O
the O
amusement O
park O
and O
gave O
up O
after O
the O
5th O
ride O
I O
couldn’t O
fit O
on. O
I O
used O
to O
go O
at O
least O
5-6 O
times O
a O
year. O
I O
haven’t O
been O
since O
and O
it’s O
been O
15 O
years. O
[SEP]
Same, O
I O
was O
always O
to O
heavy. O
Now O
it’s O
a O
goal! O
[SEP]
Yeah O
it’s O
absolutely O
insane, O
and O
impossible O
unless O
we O
are O
like O
skin O
and O
bones! O
I’m O
very O
happy O
where O
I O
am O
and O
I O
know O
once O
I O
get O
my O
skin O
removal O
(I O
have O
a O
ton O
from O
my O
previous O
apron O
belly) O
I O
will O
see O
a O
movement O
on O
the O
scale O
but O
I O
don’t O
really O
care O
about O
that. O
[SEP]
Haha O
yes! O
[SEP]
No, O
next O
Thursday! O
:D O
[SEP]
I O
didn't O
mean O
that O
comment O
to O
say O
that O
HAS O
to O
be O
your O
goal, O
i O
just O
meant O
when O
psych O
and O
docs O
ask, O
that's O
a O
good O
number O
to O
give. O
[SEP]
Girl! O
I O

u O

this O
to O
happen O
for O
u!! O
[SEP]
Oh, O
goodness! O
Good O
luck! O
Did O
you O
have O
to O
do O
the O
psych O
consult, O
too? O
[SEP]
Oh, O
I O
know! O
I O
really O
hadn't O
thought O
about O
looking O
at O
a O
healthy O
BMI O
to O
put O
a O
number O
down O
until O
it O
was O
suggested. O
Then, O
when O
I O
did, O
I O
was O
a O
little O
freaked O
out. O
I O
know O
it's O
the O
"healthy" O
range, O
and O
being O
totally O
healthy O
is O
my O
goal, O
but O
those O
numbers O
just O
seemed O
low. O
I O
picked O
the O
higher O
end O
of O
my O
healthy O
range O
and O
used O
that O
number! O
My O
healthy O
range O
begins O
at O
98lbs, O
and O
well, O
that O
kind O
of O
number O
NEVER O
crossed O
my O
mind. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you! O
❤️ O
[SEP]
It’ll O
be O
awhile, O
but O
I’m O
hoping O
maybe O
(Six O

Chicago) O
Fright O
Fest O
2023. O
Maybe O
not O
the O
Raging O
Bull, O
because O
my O
hips O
are O
big, O
but O
my O
first O

Batman O
the O
Ride. O
If O
not O
Fright O
Fest, O
I’ll O
definitely O
be O
ready O
for O
summer O
2024. O
Maybe O
even O
by O
then O
I’ll O
have O
had O
my O
apron O
removal. O
[SEP]
Yes O
multiple.consults, O
it O
was O
a O
drag O
but O
I O

it's O

to O
get O

[SEP]
Holy O
shit O
that O
is O
low! O
[SEP]
A O

I'm O
going O

if O
it O
takes O
that O
long! O
[SEP]
Yeah O
I O
was O
kind O
of O
blown O
away O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
know O
what O
country O
you O
are O
in O
but O
this O
is O
the O
case O
in O

[SEP]
Kentucky, O
in O
the O
US. O
I O
just O
have O
to O
be O
cleared O
with O
an O
EGD, O
cardiologist, O
and O
psych. O
Unfortunately, O
all O
those O
appointments O
are O
so O
backlogged O
that O
it O
can O
take O
a O
long O
time. O
[SEP]
Yeah O
thats O
also O
the O
case O
here. O
I O
can't O
blame O
them O
but O

feels O

I O
don’t O
understand O
why O
this O
is O
so O
difficult O
but O
it’s O
f’d O
up O
for O
the O
artists O
to O
the O
nth O
degree! O
We O
get O
paid O
$200 O
for O
20k O

for O
God’s O
sake..we O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
promote O
our O
release O
date O
for O
our O
song O
and O
then O
have O
it O
up O
on O
the O
platforms O
that O
very O
day, O
not O
early, O
not O
late! O
I B-Occupation
am I-Occupation
currently I-Occupation
with I-Occupation
UnitedMasters I-Occupation
but O
am O
going O
to O
switch O
because O
of O
this O
issue O
among O
other O
issues. O
But O
when O
I O
was O
looking O
this O
up, O
I O
can’t O
seem O
to O
find O
anyone O
saying O
that O
any O
certain O
one O
will O
reliably O
distribute O
on O
time. O
I O
get O
things O
like O
“tunecore O
typically O

in O
3-5 O
days” O
etc. O
[SEP]
I O
need O
one O
with O
better O
customer O
service O
than O
UnitedMasters, O
and O
comes O
through O
for O
me O
on O
release O
day O
reliably!! O
I’m O
also O
quite O
broke O
so O
it O
can’t O
be O
expensive O
really. O
Like O
no O
more O
than O
$100/yr. O
Help! O
Am O
I O
looking O
for O
something O
that O
doesn’t O
exist? O
If O
so, O
how O
do O
you O
promote O
an O
upcoming O
single O
when O
you O
don’t O

Hi O
there! O
I’m O
so O
sorry O
to O
hear O
this O
is O
happening. O
Maturation O
arrest O
is O
such O
an O
annoyance. O
I O
had O
it O
start O
after O
I O
got O
clear O
of O
cystic O
acne O
during B-Other
my I-Other
pregnancy, I-Other
when O
I O
was O
post-partum O
it O
developed O
and O
I’ve O
been O
trying O
to O
deal O
with O
it O
since. O
Face O
reality O
products O
helped O
me O
a O
lot O
with O
both, O
if O
you O
have O
access O
to O
an O
esthetician O
I O
would O
recommend O
seeing O
one O
for O
it O
as O
it O
is O
incredibly O
stubborn. O
I O
actually O
think O
my O
esthetician O
incorrectly O
increased O
the O
intensity O
of O
my O
products, O
when O
often O
maturation O
can O
be O
the O
result O
of O
the O
wrong O
products. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
use O
an O
app O
called O
“acne O
safe” O
to O
check O
the O
ingredients O
of O
all O
my O
products, O
so O
for O
your O
current O
routine O
I O
would O
check O
them O
out O
to O
make O
sure O
there O
is O
nothing O
comedogenic. O
During O
your O
pregnancy O
incorporating O
some O
mandelic O
acid O
or O
benzoyl O
peroxide O
might O
help O
if O
it O
is O
severe. O
At O
this O
point O
I O
only O
use O
a O
salicylic O
toner O
and O
occasional O
retinol O
or O
benzoyl O
peroxide, O
I O
found O
that O
with O
the O
right O
hydrating O
products O
and O
exfoliating O
a O
few O
times O
a O
week O
my O
skin O
responded O
better O
than O
when O
using O
actives O
several O
times O
a O
day. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Paula’s O
choice O
also O
has O
some O
good O
products O
that O
shouldn’t O
make O
the O
maturation O
worse. O
Good O
luck O

I’m O

there O
are O
similar O

I O
can O

I’d O

• O
Handel's O
other O
oratorios O
and O
operas. O
I O
like O
Rodelinda. O
Of O

in O
the O
operas O
it's O
more O
solo O
arias O
and O
the O
occasional O
duet O
or O
trio. O
Not O
so O
many O
choirs O
as O
in O
the O

[SEP]
[SEP]
• O
If O
you O
like O
the O
choirs O
in O
Handels O
Messiah, O
then O
you O
definitely O
should O
listen O
to O
**Bach**s O
cantatas O
and O
oratorios. O
I O
like O
BWV O
198, O
BWV O
34, O
BWV O
11 O
and O
many, O
many O
others, O
and O
would O
recommend O
those. O
Specifically O
for O
great O
choirs O
I'd O
mention O
the O
opening O
movements O
of O
BWV O
248, O
BWV O
72, O
BWV O
63, O
BWV O

the O

If O
you O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
it's O
not O
only O
very O
good, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very O
accessible, O
listen O
to O
Mozart's O
requiem O
if O
you O
haven't O
already. O
And O
to O
a O
lesser O
extent O
Pergolesi's O
Stabat O

[SEP]

• O
Other O
composers O
that O
you O
might O
want O
to O
try: O

• O
Thomas O
Linley O
the O

There's O

I O
also O

"Lasset O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Edit: O
forgot O
to O
mention O
Homilius, O
whose O
solo O
arias O
sometimes O
have O
a O
Handel-like O
quality. O
[SEP]
Gratius O
agimus O
tibi! O
[SEP]
Handel's O
setting O
of O
*Dixit O
Dominus* O
very O
much O
sounds O
like O
a O
proto-Messiah. O
Lots O
of O
musical O
ideas O
that O
are O
going O
to O
make O
much O
more O
developed O
appearances O
in O

in O
their O
early O
stages. O

Never O
mind O
the O
why O
and O
wherefore! O
[SEP]
I O
second O
this. O
Period O
recordings O
of O
baroque O
and O
classical O
period O
pieces O
have O
a O
light O
bright O
feel, O
very O
characteristic O
of O
the O
piece. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
Trevor O
Pinnock's O
version. O
[SEP]
Thanks! O
I O

Oh O
damn, O

Sixteen O

my O
go O
to O

[SEP]
[SEP]
But, O
the O
Matthias O
Passion O
is O
great, O
but, O
the O
Messe O
in O
h-moll O
is O
the O
best O
composition O
ever. O
😄 O
[SEP]
No O
BWV O
140? O
[SEP]
My O
pleasure! O
:) O
[SEP]
A O
lot O
of O
people O
think O
h-moll O
is O
#1. O
My O
argument O
for O
why O
st O
Matthew O
is O
higher O
is O
that O
the O
libretto O
is O
the O
greatest O
story O
ever O
told O
and O
the O
most, O
well, O
passionate O
- O
the O
passion O
of O
Christ. O
And O
its O
longer O
and O
it O
has O
a O
larger O
variety O
in O
its O
music. O
There O
are O
chorales, O
arias, O
recitativos, O
and O
combinations O
of O
the O
three. O
The O
mass O
only O
has O
arias O
and O
chorales. O
[SEP]
It's O
not O
in O
my O
top O
10 O
of O
favorite O
Bach O
cantatas, O
but O
the O
real O
reason O
I O
didn't O
mention O
it O
is O
I O
didn't O
think O
it O
would O
be O
useful O
to O
give O
a O
list O
of O
*35 O
cantatas O
you O
absolutely O
should O
listen O
to*. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
you're O
right O
that O
BWV O
140 O
maybe O
has O
more O
of O
a O
Messiah-vibe O
than O
some O
of O
the O
ones O
I O
did O
list. O
[SEP]
Oh O
I O
take O
your O
point, O
the O
Passion O
tells O
an O
amazing O
story O
(even O
if O
you're O
not O
a O
believer, O
it's O
a O
story O
of O
betrayal, O
suffering, O
sacrifice, O
and O
redemption), O
the O
same O
story O
the O
B-minor O
mass O
tells O
("Gloria O
in O
excelsis O
Deo", O
"Et O
resurrexit", O
etc.), O
but O
in O
a O
much O
more O
visceral O
way. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But... O
there's O
an O
amazing O
variety O
of O
styles O
in O
the O
B-minor, O
and O
Gratias O
agimus O
tibi.... O
[SEP]
[SEP]
😄 O
[SEP]
I'm O
going O
to O
listen O
to O
what O
you've O
listed! O
[SEP]
I O
suppose O
my O
main O
point O
is O
that O
the O
mass O
is O
only O
a O
musical O
work O
whereas O
the O
passion O
is O
a O
musical O
work O
with O
elements O
of O
other O
arts O
in O
it O
like O
theater O
and O
even O
painting O
if O
you O
include O
the O
music's O
ability O

paint O
a O
picture O

your O

house O
and O
7-8 O
times O
at B-Education
college. I-Education
Without O
eating O
any O
food! O
Also O
I’m O
gassy O
all O
the O
time O
whether O
I O
stoped O
eating O
or O
not. O
That’s O
why O
I O
can’t O
attend O
classes. O
cuz O
even O
if O
I O
went O
to O
the O
bathroom O
the O
min O
I O
get O
out O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
wanna O
shit O
myself O
again. O
So O
I O
go O
back O
and O
this O
feeling O
won’t O
go! O
And O
being O
gassy O
it’s O
the O
worse O
in O
high O
school O
students O
and O
even O
teachers O
used O
to O
complain O
about O
the O
smell! O
So O
I O
can’t O
do O
this O
anymore.. O
that’s O
why O
I O
need O
to O
take O
online O
classes O
and O
I O
need O
to O
make O
them O
understand O
and O
make O
them O
accept O
it! O
[SEP]
Also O
Sometimes O
I O
get O
constipated O
which O
make O
it O
worse O
more O
gassy O
and O
stomach O
ache… O
[SEP]
But O
yk O
I O
can’t O
say O
these O
words O
knowing O
all O
of O
the O
teachers O
will O
know O
this.. O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
I O
need O
to O
make O
them O
understand O
that O
I O
literally O
can’t O
go O
to O
classes.. O
can O
you O
give O
me O
some O
words O
or O
a O
way O
to O
say O
it O
better? O
[SEP]
I’d O

[SEP]
Earlier O
this O
year O
I O
discovered O
that O
all O
the O
things O
I O
thought O
made O
me O
so O
different O
the O
way O
I O
experience O
the O
world O
was O
just O
because O
I'm B-Health
an I-Health
HSP I-Health
(about O
20% O
of O
the O
population O
is!). O
But O
now O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
identify O
why O
I O
experienced O
the O
world O
a O
certain O
way, O
I O
realized O
most B-Mental_Health
of I-Mental_Health
my I-Mental_Health
anxiety, I-Mental_Health
social I-Mental_Health
anxiety, I-Mental_Health
and I-Mental_Health
depression I-Mental_Health
came O
from O
this. O
Just O
wondering O
if O
anyone O
who's O
an O
HSP O
tried O
this O
drug O
and O
has O
has O
success O
in O
being O
able O
to O
manage O
their O
anxiety. O
I'm O
on O
day O
2, O
and O
so O
far O
so O
good, O
no O
changes O
but O
I O
didn't O
expect O
any O
just O
yet. O
[SEP]
Yes, O
high O

I O
am O

the O

blunt O

Yes, O
I'm B-Health
an I-Health
HSP I-Health

and O
will O
be O

soon. O
I'm B-Occupation

I O
found O
that O
zoloft O
balances O
my O

just O
kinda... O
chills O
me O
out O
more. O
I O
also O
feel O

more O

and O
greater O

Hope O
you O

a O

Expect O
some O
weirdness O
in O
the O

with O

but O
most O
should O
diminish O
with O

I’d O

I O

I’m O
not O
feeling O

I O
feel O

It’s O

I O
never O

wait O
to O
feel O

not O

Now O
that O

somehow O
I’m O

Zoloft I-Health

how O
I O

Zoloft O
simply O
lowered O

excessive O

I O
must O
say O
the O
first O
pill O
I O
took O
I O
felt O
immediately O
(within O
10 O
minutes) O
working O
in O
on O
my O

Right O
now O
I O
feel O
a O
little O
dizzy O
and O
out O
of O
this O

but O
I O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
support O
from O
my O
wife O

colleagues O
at O
work, O
as O
I O
need O
to O
talk O
about O
my O

all O
the O

I O
gave O
it O
a O
lot O

consideration O
but O
at O
some O
point O
I O
had O
to O
draw O
the O
line O

accept O
the O
fact O
that O
doing O
nothing O

down O
the O

I O

How O

play O
atm? O
[SEP]
When O
I O
used O

his O
kit O
was O
very O
narrow, O
but O
I B-Interests
am I-Interests
a I-Interests
huge I-Interests
history I-Interests
nerd I-Interests
which O
drew O
me O
to O
the O
game O
in O
the O
first O
place, O
and O
LB O
had O
the O
most O
"realistic" O
knightly O
moves O
and O
theme. O
Warden's O
kit O
revolved O
around O
his O
shoulder O
charge O
move O
and O
it O
looks O
silly O
to O
me. O
[SEP]
Even O
though O
LB O
moves O
were O
limited, O
he O
had O
a O
high O
HP O
pool, O
so O
to O
get O
better O
at O
him O
you O
had O
to O
be O
creative O
with O
baiting O
trades O
and O
mixups, O
and O
I O
grew O
to O
love O
that O
playstyle. O
[SEP]
Does O
lawbringer O
still O
play O
like O
this? O
If O
he O
was O
changed, O
what's O
his O
current O
playstyle? O
[SEP]
Are O
there O
any O
other O
characters O
that O
play O
similarly? O
[SEP]
He’s O
still O
the O
old O
defensive O
character. O
His O
shove O
is O
very O
safe O
to O
land, O
meaning O
it O
can’t O
be O
punished. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Hell, O
All O
of O
Lawbringers O
moves O
can’t O
be O
punished. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
try O
to O
dodge O
his O
heavy O
to O
guardbreak O
him, O
he’ll O
use O
his O
second O
chain O
heavy/light. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Even O
if O
you O
try O
to O
dodge O
his O
unblockable O
heavy O
and O
try O
to O
guardbreak O
him, O
he’ll O
follow O
that O
up O
with O
a O
shove. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Lawbringer O
is O
a O
mad O
defensive O
character…and O
his O
mighty O
catchphrase(Ad O
Mortem O
Inimicus) O
is O
still O
uttered O
gloriously O
on O
dominion. O
[SEP]
He's O
literally O
the O
same. O
No O
good O
openers. O
A O
decent O
dodge O
bash O
that O
recovers O
fast O
enough O
to O
allow O
him O
to O
punish O
some O
slow O
dodge O
attacks. O
Lower O
damage O
all O
around O
but O
his O
light O
parry O
still O
deals O
a O
lot O
compared O
to O
other O
heroes. O
He's O
pretty O
much O
the O
only O
turtle O
left O
in O
the O
game. O
[SEP]
Depending O
on O
when O
you O
last O
played O
he's O
either O
completely O
different O
or O
still O
the O
same. O
Right O
now O
he O
isn't O
very O
viable O
competitively O
because O
his O
offense O
is O
rather O
lacking O
as O
he O
has O
a O
hard O
time O
initiating O
offense O
and O
getting O
to O
his O
finishers. O
However O
his O
parry O
punishes O
are O
still O
really O
good. O
But O
this O
means O
that O
you O
are O
basically O
forced O
to O
play O
defensively O
as O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
characters O
have O
gotten O
better O
offense O
over O
time. O
But O
his O
core O
playstyle O
design O
has O
stayed O
the O
same. O
You'll O
just O
have O
to O
adjust O
to O
everything O
else O
that's O
been O
changed. O
[SEP]
LB O
hasn't O
changed O
much O
at O
all O
in O
recent O
years. O
The O
only O
change O
I O
can O
remember O
since O
his O
ancient O
rework O
is O
that O
he O
lost O
the O
hyperarmor O
on O
his O
shove. O
What O
has O
changed, O
though, O
is O
the O
game O
itself. O
Moves O
are O
faster, O
with O
much O
more O
of O
a O
focus O
given O
to O
making O
reads O
as O
opposed O
to O
just O
reacting O
to O
what O
an O
enemy O
is O
going O
to O
do. O
It O
may O
take O
some O
getting O
used O
to, O
but O
by O
and O
large, O
FH O
these O
days O
is O
much O
more O
offensive, O
whereas O
lawbringer O
back O
in O
the O
day O
was O
designed O
to O
be O
defensive, O
so O
he's O
a O
fairly O
weak O
character O
in O
the O
current O
meta. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
said, O
most O
of O
the O
balance O
in O
this O
game O
is O
pretty O
decent, O
so O
you O
can O
certainly O
use O
him O
to O
good O
effect. O
It's O
just, O
that O
thing O
you O
mentioned O
about O
having O
to O
bait O
people O
into O
things O
and O
punish O
them O
for O
it? O
That's O
now O
a O
much O
larger O
part O
of O
the O
game, O
rather O
than O
just O
a O
LB O
thing. O
You'll O
be O
doing O
that O
no O
matter O
who O
you O
play. O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
the O
game O
is O
in O
a O
good O
spot O
balance O
wise. O

it's O

I O
never O

[SEP]
I B-Occupation
currently I-Occupation
work I-Occupation
in I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
proprietary I-Occupation
Software I-Occupation
Support I-Occupation
role I-Occupation
for I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
large I-Occupation
company, I-Occupation
I O
am O
due O
a O
raise O
and O
review O
in O
January O
and O
have O
been O
given O
responsibility O
over O
some O
automation O
options O
and O
analysis O
of O
our O
chat O
bot. O
I O
have O
been O
given O
an O
offer O
that O
I O
must O
respond O
to O
in O
48 O
hours O
for O
a O
Help O
Desk O
position O
at O
a O
large O
government O
contractor. O
The O
new O
role O
Would O
shift O
to O
general O
help O
desk, O
offer O
a O
2.5k O
raise, O
maintain O
my O
current O
benefits, O
support O
a O
secret O
clearance O
(biggest O
deal O
for O
me) O
but O
I O
would O
also O
could O
very O
likely O
end O
up O
at O
3rd O
shift O
or O
other O
similarly O
odd O
hours. O
My O
questions O
are O
as O
follows: O
[SEP]
1. O
Is O
the O
new O
experience O
worth O
the O
switch? O
[SEP]
2. O
Would O
my O
current O
job O
be O
better O
for O
a O
future O
in O
development? O
[SEP]
3. O
How O
valuable O
is O
experience O
with O
government O
work O
at O
a O
secret O
clearance O
level? O
[SEP]
4. O
Should O
I O
speak O
to O
my O
current O
manager O
about O
the O
possible O
raise O
and O
review? O
[SEP]
5. O
Should O
I O
worry O
about O
failing O
to O
receive O
the O
clearance O
and O
therefore O
having O
left O
my O
job O
for O
no O
reason? O
[SEP]
6.Is O
there O
any O
more O
information O
I O
could O
gather O
that O
could O
help O
my O
decision? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
to O
anyone O
who O
reads O
and O
replies. O
I’m O
at O
a O
loss. O
[SEP]
To O
me O
it O
sounds O
like O
the O
job O
you O
have O
is O
better O
than O
the O
one O
you're O
going O
for O
(you O
can O
probably O
get O
a O
2.5k O
raise O
in O
the O
review), O
but O
there O
is O
value O
in O
having O
a O
security O
clearance. O
You O
can O
always O
take O
the O
new O
job, O
work O
for O
a O
short O
period O
then O
apply O
to O
better O
positions O
such O
as O
something O
in O
development O
if O
you O
like. O
Having O
the O
clearance O
makes O
finding O
better O
and O
higher O
paying O
jobs O
easy, O
and O
if O
you O
can O
find O
one O
that O
will O
sponsor O
upgrading O
your O
secret O
to O
a O
TS O
that's O
even O
better O
(although O
doing O
this O
will O
most O
likely O
eliminate O
almost O
any O
fully O
remote O
jobs O
if O
that's O
important O
to O
you). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
for O
failing O
to O
receive O
the O
clearance, O
I O
wouldn't O
worry O
unless O
you O
know O
there's O
something O
that O
would O
eliminate O
you. O
Things O
like O
undisclosed O
drug O
use O
coming O
to O
light, O
criminal O
background O
history, O
and O
being O
in O
serious O
debt. O
By O
that O
I O
mean O
having O
bills O
120+ O
days O
behind O
and O
being O
in O
collections. O
If O
you O
have O
a O
clean O
background O
then O
there's O
no O
reason O
why O
it O
wouldn't O
go O
through. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Just O
give O
it O
some O
thought. O
If O
you O
don't O
like O
where O
you O
are O
then O
it's O
a O
no O
brainer O
to O
leave. O
If O
you O
do, O
you O
can O
give O
it O
some O
time O
to O
possibly O
find O
a O
better O
job O
that O
will O
sponsor O
a O
clearance, O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
take O
the O
first O
one O
offered. O
[SEP]
Clearance O
is O
invaluable. O
Just O
work O
there O
long O
enough O
to O
get O
one, O
and O
then O
you're O
golden. O
[SEP]
My O
experience O
working O
in O
the O
Federal O
contractor O
space O
was O
terrible. O
Wouldn't O
wish O
those O
jobs O
on O
my O
worst O
enemy. O
[SEP]
This O
really O
helped O
ease O
my O
anxiety O
about O
the O
decision O
[SEP]
Even O
worth O
leaving O
a O
chill O
and O
good O
job O
for O
one O
potentially O
much O
busier O
and O
with O
a O
possibly O
MUCH O
worse O
schedule? O
[SEP]
My O
experience O
is O
the O
opposite. O
I'm B-Occupation
a I-Occupation
federal I-Occupation
contractor I-Occupation
now, I-Occupation
my I-Occupation
first I-Occupation
IT I-Occupation
job I-Occupation
was I-Occupation
working I-Occupation
for I-Occupation
a I-Occupation
fortune I-Occupation
100 I-Occupation
tech I-Occupation
company. I-Occupation
I O
have O
no O
desire O
to O
go O
back. O
The O
only O
main O
downside O
is O
that O
I O
can't O
wfh O
100% O
of O
the O
time O
since O
my O
job O
requires O
TS/SCI O
clearance O
and O
there O
are O
things O
I O
can O
only O
do O
in O
a O
SCIF. O
But O
it's O
easy O
and O
the O
pay O
is O
great O
so O
it O
makes O
up O
for O
it. O
[SEP]
Yes O
imo O
[SEP]
Should O
I O
have O
worries O
about O
failing O
to O
get O
the O
clearance O
and O
losing O
the O
opportunity? O
I O
have O
been O
open O
with O
people O
that O
know O
that O
I O
have O
very O
far O
left O
political O
stances O
and O
I’m O
sure O
that O
can O
be O
found O
out O
about O

I O
have O
great O
credit O

no O

getting O

cuts O
too, O

if O
my O

it O

how O

his O

you O

Anyway O
I B-Health
had I-Health
back I-Health
problems I-Health
for I-Health
most I-Health
of I-Health
my I-Health
life I-Health
now. I-Health
I O
was O
convinced O
it O
was O
from O
me O
growing O
up O
gaming O
and O
spending O
lot O
of O
time O
sitting O
in O
awkward O
positions O
which O
caused O
slight O
curvature O
in O
my O
back. O
When O
school O
started O
those O
school O
desks O
that O
I O
refer O
to O
as O
back O
breakers O
didn't O
help O
at O
all. O
Sitting O
in O
them O
for O
years O
and O
years O
caused O
me O
even O
more O
back O
pain O
and O
I O
was O
convinced O
this O
is O
never O
gonna O
go O
away. O
I B-Age
am I-Age
now I-Age
almost I-Age
29 I-Age
years I-Age
old I-Age
and O
I O
am O
working O
12 O
hrs O
a O
day O
and O
I O
accepted O
this O
was O
gonna O
be O
something O
I O
am O
gonna O
deal O
with O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life. O
At O
best O
I O
hoped O
it O
would O
stay O
same O
and O
not O
get O
worse O
so O
I O
"learned" O
to O
live O
with O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Anyway O
few O
months O
back O
out O
of O
nowhere O
it O
got O
so O
bad O
and O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
for O
it O
to O
be O
this O
bad O
since O
I O
stopped O
working O
out, O
or O
doing O
anything O
that O
would O
cause O
this O
amount O
of O
pain O
or O
damage O
to O
my O
back. O
It O
got O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
couldn't O
even O
sit O
anymore, O
pain O
was O
getting O
unbearable, O
and O
at O
work O
I O
struggled O
to O
lift O
even O
empty O
boxes O
without O
bending O
in O
awkward O
positions O
and O
going O
through O
excruciating O
pain O
when O
sitting O
back O
up. O
I O
took O
vacation O
for O
3 O
weeks O
but O
it O
didn't O
get O
any O
better, O
only O
worse. O
I O
would O
mostly O
just O
lay O
in O
my O
bed O
and O
hope O
it O
goes O
way O
but O
it O
didn't. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
hope O
this O
is O
not O
too O
much O
info O
but O
one O
day O
I O
couldn't O
even O
go O
to O
bathroom O
because O
sitting O
down O
put O
me O
in O
excruciating O
pain. O
I O
tried O
my O
best O
to O
take O
shower O
but O
I O
couldn't O
bend O
down O
to O
take O
off O
my O
socks O
and O
this O
is O
when O
I O
had O
enough O
of O
this O
BS. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
sat O
back O
and O
tried O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
happened, O
did O
I O
damage O
some O
disc O
in O
my O
back, O
maybe O
some O
nerve O
damage O
or O
what O
is O
causing O
this? O
There O
has O
to O
be O
a O
reason. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
eventually O
realized O
similar O
thing O
happened O
many O
times O
in O
my O
life. O
I O
had O
once O
excruciating O
pain O
in O
my O
wrist O
for O
a O
week O
where O
I O
couldn't O
even O
use O
mouse O
or O
computer O
and O
recently O
even O
had O
so O
much O
pain O
in O
my O
right O
foot O
that O
I O
was O
limping O
for O
week O
and O
thought O
I O
broke O
my O
foot. O
So O
what O
was O
causing O
all O
this? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
realized O
it O
was O
emotions. O
I O
know O
now O
many O
of O
you O
will O
roll O
your O
eyes O
and O
say O
get O
the O
fuck O
out O
of O
here O
with O
that O
Law O
of O
Attraction O
BS, O
and O
trust O
me O
I O
would O
once O
say O
that O
too O
but O
it's O
true. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
realized O
it O
was O
anger, O
regret, O
anxiety. O
Every O
time O
I O
would O
feel O
these O
emotions O
it O
would O
fire O
up O
pain O
in O
my O
body O
instantly O
and O
my O
life O
these O
days O
is O
going O
to O
shit O
so O
I O
felt O
so O
much O
anger O
and O
regret O
and O
it O
caused O
all O
this O
pain. O
I O
realized O
I O
kept O
bottling O
up O
these O
emotions O
and O
never O
expressing O
them O
and O
my O
body O
was O
trying O
to O
tell O
me O
something. O
I O
knew O
there O
is O
something O
to O
this O
so O
I O
googled O
it. O
I O
researched O
all O
this O
and O
realized O
there O
are O
some O
people O
who O
realized O
the O
same O
thing. O
I O
even O
checked O
this O
sub O
and O
found O
one O
post O
that O
said O
the O
same O
thing, O
how O
they O
healed O
their O
back O
pain O
with O
book O
called O
"Healing O
back O
pain O
by O
John O
Sarno" O
and O
I O
found O
it O
on O
YT O
and O
listened. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
knew O
he O
was O
telling O
the O
truth O
because O
I O
realized O
this O
my O
self. O
I O
kept O
listening O
and O
listening O
and O
listening O
and O
it O
made O
more O
sense O
every O
time O
and O
in O
less O
than O
24 O
hours O
all O
pain O
was O
gone. O
I O
was O
in O
so O
much O
pain O
while O
listening O
to O
this O
book, O
I O
tried O
fighting O
off O
my O
mind O
that O
kept O
telling O
me O
this O
is O
BS O
and O
how O
my O
back O
is O
not O
gonna O
get O
better O
and O
how O
something O
is O
broken/damaged O
and O
I O
can't O
fix O
it O
with O
my O
mind O
alone. O
I O
kept O
bending O
down O
despite O
excruciating O
pain O
and O
I O
didn't O
let O
my O
mind O
win O
this O
time. O
I O
even O
went O
to O
workout O
and O
I O
couldn't O
lift O
my O
dumbells O
off O
floor O
with O
my O
arms O
because O
pain O
was O
too O
much O
but O
I O
would O
bend O
in O
very O
awkward O
positions O
and O
knew O
I O
had O
to O
beat O
my O
mind O
and O
pain O
was O
not O
real O
so O
I O
would O
lift O
them O
up O
any O
way O
I O
could O
and O
workout. O
I O
went O
to O
sleep O
and O
woke O
up O
with O
same O
pain O
but O
I O
didn't O
give O
up O
and O
during O
the O
day O
it O
just O
went O
away. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
swear O
I O
am O
not O
making O
this O
up. O
I O
just O
couldn't O
accept O
this O
shit O
anymore O
and O
I O
had O
to O
change O
it O
at O
any O
cost. O
Now O
I O
have O
0 O
pain O
and O
If O
I O
accepted O
what O
my O
mind O
told O
me O
I O
would O
prob O
now O
be O
laying O
down O
on O
my O
bed O
and O
praying O
to O
die O
from O
all O
that O
pain. O

Hey O
I O
believe O

psychosomatic. O

you O
mind O
sharing O
how O
you O
released O

you O

LOA, O
Neville O
Goddard, O

others O
just O
call O
it O
something O
different O

maybe O
add O
a O
little O
flair O
but O
they O
are O
all O
very O
similar O
concepts. O
Humans O
are O

i O

No O
this O
is O
true. O
It’s O
all O
basically O
pointing O
out O
to O
the O
same O
truth O
that O
your O
inner O
world O
shapes O
your O
outer O
world. O
And O
emotions O
are O
part O
of O
the O
as O
well. O
If O
know O
how O
to O
feel O
our O
emotions O
without O
resisting O
them O
which O
is O
pretty O
hard O
especially O
with O
uncomfortable O
emotions O
like O
sadness O
or O
anger, O
then O
we O
won’t O
even O
manifest O
bodily O
pain O
or O
mental O
diseases. O
I O
personally O
used O
to O
have O
these O
unbearable O
headaches O
and O
then O
I O
realized O
that O
the O
root O
cause O
of O
it O
is O
repressed O
anger. O
Like O
my O
belief O
in O
the O
wrongness O
of O
anger O
manifests O
as O
headaches. O
I O
started O
looking O
into O
why O
I O
believe O
anger O
is O
bad O
and O
how O
I O
can O
feel O
my O
anger. O
Every O
time O
I O
get O
headaches O
I O
ask O
myself O
what O
am O
I O
angry O
at. O
By O
making O
my O
pain O
conscious O
and O
releasing O
it, O
I O
am O
relieved O
of O
unconscious O
need O
to O
manifest O
pain O
for O
myself. O
I O
have O
gotten O
really O
good O
at O
it O
that O
I O
don’t O
even O
experience O
headaches O
any O
more. O
[SEP]
Truth O
is O
that O
we O
are O
conditioned O
to O
think O
emotions O
are O
bad O
and O
they O
mess O
things O
up O
while O
the O
truth O
is O
that O
they O
are O
just O
guiding O
you O
to O
see O
what O
you O
truly O
feel. O
They O
are O
not O
to O
be O
hold O
on O
to O
but O
rather O
felt. O
[SEP]
And O
in O
your O
case O
with O
the O
back O
pain, O
that’s O
absolutely O
true. O
It’s O
pent O
up O
emotions O
that O
feel O
like O
a O
burden O
which O
is O
why O
it O
manifests O
as O
back O
pain. O
It’s O
truly O
remarkable O
how O
we O

I O
think O
more O
than O
anything O
it O
was O
just O
realization O
that O
the O
pain O
wasn't O
real. O
There O
wasn't O
any O
damage O
in O
my O
back, O
nothing O
was O
wrong O
with O
me. O
My O
mind O
was O
doing O
all O
this. O
I O
did O
feel O
intense O
relief O
and O
relaxation O
upon O
this O
realization O
so O
I O
guess O
I O
did O
release O
other O
emotions O
simultaneously O
too. O
[SEP]
This! O
I O
don’t O
understand O
the O
hate O
for O
loa O
because O
it’s O
just O
a O
slightly O
different O
approach O
to O
the O
same O
thing. O
How O
I O
see O
it O
Neville O
just O
turned O
this O
principle O
into O
a O
very O
practical O
guide. O
[SEP]
Coming O
from O
the O
loa, O
when O
I O
started O
to O
study O
Neville O
there O
was O
nothing O
I O
didn’t O
know O
before, O
just O
some O
more O
practical O
techniques O
and O
sometimes O
things O
just O
worded O
in O
a O
way O
that O
made O
me O
understand O
it O
on O
a O
new O
level. O
[SEP]
Congrats! O
May O
I O
ask, O
was O
it O
just O
your O
newfound O
awareness O
that O
it O
was O
psychosomatic O
that O
"cured" O
it? O
Or O
did O
you O
also O
do O
affirmations O
or O
something O
to O
release O
the O
emotions? O

Trust O
me O
it's O
not O
fake. O
I O
would O
not O
lie O
about O
this. O
It O
truly O
was O
unbearable/excruciating O
pain O
that O
I O
could O
not O
accept O
or O
deal O
with O
any O
longer. O
I O
also O
am O
not O
offering O
any O
"coaching O

or O
selling O
any O
books O
or O
promoting O
my O

anything O

so O
I O
gain O
nothing O
from O
lying O
about O
this. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
do O
understand O
your O
suspicion. O
I O
have O
seen O
plenty O
of O
those O
fake O

that O
were O
obvious O
scripting O

lying O
for O

obvious O
fake O
"success" O
stories O
to O
attract O
future O

when O
OP O
starts O

[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
took O
less O
than O
24 O
hrs O
because O
at O
that O
point O
I O
knew O
without O
a O
doubt O
pain O
was O
nor O
real, O
there O
is O
no O
damage O
in O
my O
back O
and O
it O
was O
mind O
was O
doing O
all O
this, O
playing O
trick O
on O
me. O

[SEP]
I O
have O
worked O
out, O
lifted O
heavy, O
bent O
in O
all O
sort O
of O

since O
that O
day O
and O
literally O
0 O
issues O

Pain O
is O
gone O
completely. O

LOA O
is O
based O
on O
another O
paradigm O
(the O
universe O
decides, O
vibrations O
are O
manifesting, O
you've O
to O
take O
some O
inspired O
actions, O
etc.). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Not O
saying O
that O
LOA O
is O
bs O
or O
something. O
It's O
just O
an O
opposite O
conception O
of O
the O
art O
of O
manifestation. O
[SEP]
Yea, O
there O
is O
also O
science O
behind O
it. O
If O
you O
take O
out O
the O
energy O
and O
religion O
pieces, O
perception O
and O
therefore O
reality O
really O
is O
subjective. O
Tons O
of O
tedtalks O
on O
changing O
thought O
patterns O
and O
changing O
your O
perceptions. O
At O
the O
basic O
bare O
bones O
level, O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
comes O
down O
to O
re-wiring O
your O
brain O
and O
getting O
out O
of O
negative O
thought O
patterns. O
The O
basic O
concepts O
behind O
these O
things O
are O
all O
the O
same, O
we O
are O
the O
master O
of O
our O
own O
minds O
and O
therefore O
our O
thoughts O
and O
our O
own O
reality. O
[SEP]
I O
did O
pain O
reprocessing O
therapy. O
Look O
into O
Alan O
Gordon. O
I O
understood O
the O
science. O
I O
also O
woke O
up O
everyday O
and O
told O
myself O
"today O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
good O
day." O
Honestly O
my O
days O
were O
AWFUL O
for O
8 O
months O
straight O
(around O
month O
5 O
is O
when O
I O
started O
the O
process)... O
[SEP]
I B-Occupation
worked I-Occupation
with I-Occupation
SIRPA I-Occupation
in B-Location
the I-Location
U.K. I-Location
and O
also O
the O
Curable O
app. O
Learning O
about O
pain O
science O
and O
the O
complete O
belief O
in O
my O
body’s O
ability O
to O
heal O
myself O
was O
key. O
Also O
practising O
indifference O
towards O
the O
pain O
(ie O
no O
longer O
reacting O
to O
it O
with O
negative O
emotions). O
[SEP]
If O
you O
have O
an O

[SEP]
Well, O
at O
the O
very O
least O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
overlap, O
and O
it O
might O
depend O
on O
what O
loa O
coach O
you’re O
following. O
I O
don’t O
think O
I’ve O
heard O
Hicks O
say O
that O
the O
universe O
decides. O
And O
to O
quote O
Neville: O
“your O
dimensionally O
larger O
self O
speaks O
to O
you O
through O
the O
language O
of O
desire. O
Do O
not O
de O
deceive O
yourself. O
Knowing O
what O
you O
want, O
claim O
you O
already O
have O
it, O
for O
it O
is O
your O
Father’s O
good O
pleasure O
to O
give O
it O
to O
you” O
which O
sounds O
to O
me O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
when O
Hicks O
talks O
about O
your O
higher O
being, O
or O
could O
be O
interpreted O
as O
‘the O
universe’. O
And O
I O
know O
Neville O
says O
you O
can O
manifest O
without O
lifting O
a O
finger, O
but O
I O
feel O
like O
taking O
inspired O
action O
could O
be O
the O
same O
thing O
or O
very O
similar O
to O
Neville’s O
bridge O
of O
incidents. O
And O
when O
they O
say O
vibration O
attracts, O
in O
my O
interpretation O
it O
is O
basically O
like O
Neville’s O
state. O
When O
I O
focus O
on O
everything O
that O
is O
going O
right O
for O
me, O
and O
everything O
I O
have O
and O
love, O
instead O
of O
everything O
I O
lack O
and O
dislike, O
I O
am O
in O
the O
state O
of O
having O
and O
loving, O
giving O
me O
more O
things O
to O
have O
and O
love, O
or O
at O
least O
that’s O
how O
my O
experience O
has O
been. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
while O
I O
don’t O
really O
disagree O
with O
you, O
I O
don’t O
think O
I’m O
entirely O
wrong O
either, O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
this O
might O
have O
to O
do O
with O
how O
I O
personally O
interpret O
and O
experience O
things O
:) O

[SEP]
I've O
had O
the O
Citi O
Costco O
card O
for O

now O
which O
has O

great O
obviously O
for O

well O
as O

at O
4%. O
That O
said, O
I B-Possession

a I-Possession
Tesla I-Possession
Model I-Possession
3 I-Possession
in B-Time

UNTIL O
I O
got O
an O
email O
from O
Citi O
in O
the O
last O
couple O
weeks O
that O
states O
that O
the O
4% O
include O

This O
must O

relatively O
new O
cuz O
I O
haven't O
really O
seen O
it O
advertised O

I O
called O

and O
confirmed O
that O
you O
will O
get O
4% O
on O
transactions O
that O
include O
"Tesla" O
or O

The O
only O
other O
cards O
I O
know O
that O
offer O
good O
rewards O
on O

are O
from O
Uber. O
Curious O
to O

other O

we O

[SEP]
what O
we O
even O
do O
in O

also O
hangouts. O

I O
don't O

why O

I O

there O
just O
hasn't O
been O
anyone O
to O
step O
up. O

There's O
definitely O
a O
big O

it O

Hi O
Thnx O
to O
all O
for O
being O
concerned O
about O
UB. O
And O
this O
is O
just O
an O
opinion O
UB O
grad O
and O
very O
shocked O
that O
UB O
has O
an O
issue O
with O
reasonable O
accommodation O
for O
all. O
My O
thing O
is O
joined O
Schussmeister O
about O
10 O
years O
ago O
for O
the O
season O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
refund O
or O
credit O
to O
next O
season O
as O
my O
physical O
condition O
changed O
rapidly. O
Well O
documented O
letter O
from O
Doc O
about O
degenerative O
condition. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
the O
club O
prez O
rudely O
dismissed O
my O
concern. O
Just O
saying. O
Wishing O
all O
the O
best. O
[SEP]
I O
had O
no O
idea O
about O
that! O
But O
unfortunately O
SA O
doesn’t O
let O
you O
resurrect O
an O
old O
club O
unlike O
other O
schools. O
A O
new O
club O
with O
a O
different O
name O
has O
to O
be O
formed. O
[SEP]
What O
would O
an O
LGBTQ O
club O
do? O
What O
would O
a O
Latin O
American O
club O
do? O
These O
clubs O
can O
bring O
people O
of O
a O
shared O
identity O
together, O
and O
that O
alone O
can O
be O
powerful. O
But O
they O
can O
also O
be O
advocates O
for O
change O
on O
campus, O
create O
safe O
spaces O
for O
marginalized O
students, O
or O
just O
be O
a O
space O
for O
people O
to O
have O
fun, O
watch O

organize O
trips, O
eat O
good O
food, O
etc. O
Though O
I O
am O
not O
disabled O
I O
imagine O
there's O
a O
LOT O
such O
a O
club O
could O
do O
such O
as O
organizing O
trips O
that O
are O
friendly O
to O
disabled O
people O
around O
the O
Buffalo O
area, O
advocating O
for O
better O
accessibility O
on O

and O
creating O
an O
environment O
where O
people O
who O
struggle O
with O
a O
disability O
can O
connect O
and O
find O
community O
on O

club O
has O
good O
intentions. O
But, O
not O
a O
single O
one O
run O
by O
disabled O
students O
for O
disabled O
students. O
[SEP]
Ba’dum O
tss O
[SEP]
Yes O
I O
will O
definitely! O
[SEP]
There O
is O
a O
club O
focused O
on O
mental O
health O
called O
active O
minds, O
so O
same O
can O
be O
argued O
for O
them O
🤨 O
[SEP]
DM O
me? O
[SEP]
It O
wasn't O
under O
SA O
which O
was O
the O
best O
part O
haha. O
A O
different O
student O
affairs O
esque O
department O
but O
I O
forget O
which O
one. O
[SEP]
TIL O
SA O
has O
thought O
of O
every O
possible O
way O
to O
suck O
ass O
and O
executes O
on O
them O
all O
[SEP]
No O
you O
can O
bring O
back O
an O
old O
club O
name. O
It’s O
the O
same O
process O
as O
starting O
a O
new O
club O
but O
you O
can O
use O
their O
premade O
constitution. O
I O
know O
bc O
I O
revitalized O
the O
club O
for O
Indigenous O
Students O
on O
campus O
this O
year O
despite O
it O
being O
disbanded O
by O
SA O
the O
year O
before. O
(Not O
all O
the O
club O
requirements O
were O
met) O
[SEP]
Exactly. O
Nobody O
questions O
any O
other O
club. O
There O
is O
a O
fucking O
lettuce O
club, O
nobody O
questions O
their O
goddamn O
existence O
(no O
offense O
to O
anyone O
involved). O
Everybody O
is O
all O
about O
DEI O
at O
this O
damn O
school O
until O
disability O
is O
brought O
up. O
People O
either O
ignore O
or O
dismiss O
our O
needs O
(Example: O
UB O
and O
the O
food O
allergies,guess O
what, O
allergies O
are O
a O
disability!) O
or O
they O
treat O
us O
like O
fragile O
children. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
To O
add, O
anyone O
who O
is O
questioning O
this O
club, O
guess O
fucking O
what, O
everyone O
has O
a O
chance O
of O
joining O
the O
disability O
community O
at O
any O
point O
in O
their O
lives. O
One O
day O
you O
could O
get O
a O
car O
accident O
and O
boom, O
you O
are O
paralyzed. O
It’s O
a O
uncomfortable O
thought O
for O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
but O
it’s O
true. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
this O
school O
preaches O
intersectionality, O
disability O
needs O
to O
be O
included. O
[SEP]
That O
sounds O
painfully O
boring O
[SEP]
Be O
the O
change O
:) O
[SEP]
Awesome! O
I’ll O
dm O
you O
[SEP]
I’m O
not O
arguing O
or O
making O
a O
point O
tho, O
it’s O
just O
a O
joke O
[SEP]
I O
would O
hate O
to O
take O
the O
name O
of O
the O
other O
club O
but O
that O
is O
good O
to O
know O
that O
there O
was O
interest. O
[SEP]
You’re O
probably O
thinking O
of O
SBI, O
UB O
absorbed O
the O
money O
SBI O
acquired O
and O
dissolved O
the O
organization O
a O
couple O
years O
ago, O

two O

ok. O
Your O

That’s O
really O
good. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
At O
this O
stage O
you O

to O

on O
1% O
changes. O
Otherwise O
it’s O
overwhelming. O
What O
thing O
can O
you O
do O
today O
to O
make O
things O
1% O
better O
for O
tomorrow? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
would O
say O
for O
now O
that’s O
to O
eat. O
Make O
sure O
you O
have O
something O
small O
for O
breakfast O
each O
day. O
That’s O
your O
challenge. O
Then O
for O
lunch. O
Then O
for O
dinner. O
Not O
a O
amazing O
meal O
for O
now O
but O
the O
rhythm O
of O
eating. O
Then O
challenge O
yourself O
to O
make O
a O
little O
more O
effort. O
Healthier O
food. O
New O
food. O
But O
each O
time O
one O
small O
step. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Music O
try O
ambient O
noise O
lists O
on O

or O
Spotify. O
Or O
lofi O
music. O
It’s O
much O
of O
nothing O
but O
not O
silence. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
your O
spiralling O
thoughts, O
distractions O
are O
good. O
But O
that O
depends O
what O
you O
enjoy O
and O
what O
you O
are O
able O
to O
do. O
A O
sport. O
A O
walk. O
Or O
if O
you O
can O
try O
to O
go O
1 O
min O
of O
breathing. O
Again O
not O
30 O
mins O
but O
one O
min. O
Then O
two. O
Then O
three. O
Steps O
each O
time. O
When O
your O
ten O
mins O
in O
remembering O
you O
started O
at O
1. O
Small O
steps. O
Maybe O
write O
down O
in O
a O
diary O
or O
a O
bit O
of O
paper O
so O
you O
see O
the O
progress O
as O
it’s O
hard O
remember O
where O
you O
started. O

Lastly O
nobody O
has O
it O
figured O
out. O
Some O
get O
through O
it O
better. O
Some O
get O
more O
luck O
but O
I O
have O
met O
people O
from O
all O
walks O
of O
life O
when O
you O
get O
into O
it O
have O
or O
have O
had O
issues. O
Keep O
doing O
one O
step O
and O
when O
you O
walk O
backwards O
that’s O
fine O
because O
your O
walk O
forward O
again. O
[SEP]

I O
hope O
you O
get O
the O

lately O
ive O
been O
watching O
predator O
catchers O
on O
youtube O
(like O
when O
they O
pose O

minors O
to O
catch O
predators O
in O
the O
act O
of O
attempting O
to O
meet O
up O
with O
them O
for O

something O
that O
really O

surrounding O
the B-Personal_Experiences
sexual I-Personal_Experiences
assault I-Personal_Experiences
i I-Personal_Experiences
recently I-Personal_Experiences

is O
that O
whenever O
the O
predators O
start O
making O
excuses O
and O
say O
shit O
like O
"i O
made O
a O
mistake" O
theyre O
immediately O
called O
out O
and O
told O
"no, O
you O
didnt O
make O
a O
mistake. O
you O
made O
a O

it O
just O
really O
put O
things O
in O
perspective O
for O
me O
and O
helped O
me O
stop O
making O
so O
many O
excuses O
for O
my O
ex O
and O
its O
helped O
me O
stop O
blaming O
myself O
so O
much O
(obviously O
im O
not O
fully O
to O
this O
point O
in O
my O
healing O

yet O

again O
its O
been O
helpful). O
cuz O
yeah, O
my O
ex O
absolutely O
had O
control O
over O
his O
own O
actions O
and O
he O
chose O
to O
ignore O
my O

and O
chose O
to O

me O
into O

while O
knowing O
i O
didnt O

it. O

I O
would O
take O
mental O
notes O
of O
what O
palettes O
she O
currently O
has, O
and O
what O
color O
themes O
she O
enjoys O
and O
try O
to O
find O
something O
that O
fits O
in O
her O
usual O
color O
theme, O
while O
still O
branching O
out O
a O
little! O
So O
if O
she O
does O
a O
lot O
of O
orange O
looks, O
the O
Natasha O
Denona O
Zendo O
palette O
might O
be O
a O
nice O
addition! O
If O
she's O
someone O
who O
really O
doesn't O

a O

that O
Pat O

[SEP]
Hi O
everyone! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
father, O
uncle O
and O
I O
are O
keen O
to O
look O
into O
some O
family O
history. O
I B-Religion
did I-Religion
not I-Religion
grow I-Religion
up I-Religion
Jewish I-Religion
and I-Religion
converted I-Religion
as I-Religion
an I-Religion
adult. I-Religion
Since O
I've O
converted, O
my O
uncle O
has O
come O
to O
speak O
to O
me O
about O
something O
I'd O
not O
heard O
regarding O
our O
family O
history: O
my B-Family
great-grandmother I-Family
(and I-Family
therefore I-Family
my I-Family
paternal I-Family
grandmother) I-Family
were I-Family
apparently I-Family
Jewish. I-Family
We O
have O
absolutely O
no O
documented O
evidence O
of O
this, O
however. O
We're B-Race_Nationality
from I-Race_Nationality
a I-Race_Nationality
country I-Race_Nationality
in I-Race_Nationality
the I-Race_Nationality
former I-Race_Nationality
Yugoslavia, I-Race_Nationality
and O
so O
any O
evidence O
would O
have O
been O
disposed O
of O
during O
WWII O
in O
order O
to O
protect O
them O
from O
persecution. O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
feasible O
it O
is- O
but O
I O
also O
don't O
know O
how O
this O
story O
would O
have O
started O
if O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
it O
either. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Has O
anyone O
got O
any O
experience O
with O
looking O
into O
things O
like O
this? O
I'm O
at O
a O
loss O
at O
where O
to O
start. O
My B-Family
great-grandmother I-Family
was I-Family
born I-Family
in I-Family
Austria- I-Family
should O
I O
start O
there? O
[SEP]
Austrian O
here. O
It’s O
mandatory O
for O
every O
inhabitant O
to O
have O
their O
permanent O
address O
registered O
with O
the O
authorities O
at O
all O
times O
and O
has O
been O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
- O
meaning O
since O
well O
into O
the O
imperial O
era, O
though O
historic O
consistency O
could O
be O
compromised O
if O
the O
place O
of O
residence O
ended O
up O
being O
part O
of O
another O
country O
at O
some O
point O
after O
the O
empire O
was O
dissolved O
or O
sometime O
inbetween. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
know O
where O
they O
used O
to O
live, O
you O
can O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
registry O
office O
at O
the O
town O
hall O
(Gemeindeamt O
in O
villages, O
Rathaus O
or O

in O
cities) O
or O
the O
national O
archives O
and O
ask O
them O
for O
help O
finding O
the O
historic O
records O
(Meldezettel). O
This O
should O
be O
independent O
from O
religious O
community O
records O
and O
will O
probably O
have O
survived O
the O
wars O
in O
most O
cases. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Registering O
personal O
data O
like O
religion O
was O
obligatory O
until O
very O
recently, O
so O
if O
your O
great-grandmother O
was O
indeed O
Jewish, O
it O
will O
say O
mosaisch O
or O
israelitisch O
in O
the O
field O
for O
Bekenntnis O

on O
the O

[SEP]
My O
mom O
tracked O
out O
family O
history. O
If O
you O
have O
names O
of O
family O
members/know O
the O

they O
lived O
in O
and O
when O
they O
were O
born O
you O
can O
see O
if O
their O
are O

there O
(bear O
in O

you O
might O

to O
also O
find O
someone O

Unfortunately O
the O

But O
believe O
it O
or O
not O
the O
Mormon O

is O
a O
really O
good O
resource. O
They O
have O
one O
of O
the O
best O
archives O
for O

records O
because O
they O
believe O
in O

everyone. O

I O
will O
also O
say O
don't O
worry O
about O
not O
knowing O
where O
to O
start. O
Its O
a O
lot O
of O
detective O
work. O
For O
my O
mom, O
the O
process O
took O
time, O
sometimes O
progression O
was O
slow, O
only O
finding O
documents O
piecemeal, O
other O
times O
she'd O
find O
a O
document O
and O
make O
a O
bunch O
of O
breakthroughs. O
Either O
way, O
its O
really O
worth O
the O
effort. O
and O
Good O
luck O
:) O
[SEP]
I O
would O
start O
by O
taking O
a O
DNA O
test. O
If O
she's O
Ashkenazi, O
you'll O
get O
clear O
confirmation O
of O
it O
from O
the O
test. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
also O
look O
through O
matches O
and O
their O
trees O
to O
see O
if O
you O
find O
anything. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
done O
a O
completely O
document O
trail O
of O
my O
family O
tree. O
If O
you O
know O
your O
grandparents' O
names O
and O
birth O
years/ O
other O
family O
members O
it O
is O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
paper O
trail. O
[SEP]
All O
the O
good O
advice O
has O
already O
been O
given; O
just O
chiming O
in O
to O
say O
that O
this O
is O
very O
plausible, O
in O
case O
(as O
I O
perceive O
from O
what O
you O
wrote) O
you're O
skeptical. O
Many O
Ashkenazi O
Jews O
from O
Austrian-ruled O
parts O
of O
Europe O
(Bukovina, O
Galicia, O
Austria O
proper) O
ended O
up O
in O
Serbia O
well O
along O
the O
path O
to O
assimilation O
and O
usually O
conversion. O
(I O
know O
there O
were O
Sephardic O
communities O
there O
but O
I O
don't O
know O
much O
about O
their O
religious O
trajectories.) O

This O
has O
been O
an O
invaluable O
resource O
and O
their O
newsletters O
are O
interesting. O
[SEP]
DNA O
tests O
aren't O
always O
a O
good O
indication O
of O
Jewish O
ancestry. O
For O
all O
they O
know O
they O
might O
not O
even O
be O
Ashkenazi. O
[SEP]
Thirded. O
My O
favorite O
database O
to O
use! O
[SEP]
So O
as O
I O
said, O
if O
this O
ancestor O
was O
Ashkenazi O
it's O
a O
good O
indicator. O
Ashkenazi O
DNA O
is O
distinct O
and O
easily O
identifiable. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
significant O
amount O
of O
Ashkenazi O
DNA, O
it O
will O
show O
up O
in O
your O
results. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
the O
ancestor O
was O
Sephardic O
from O
the O
Balkans, O
a O
DNA O
test O
is O
still O
a O
really O
good O
idea. O
If O
you O
look O
at O
the O
23&Me O
results O
of O
Sephardic O
Jews O
from O
the O
Balkans, O
they O
virtually O
always O
get O
somewhere O
from O
20-45% O
Ashkenazi O
in O
their O
results. O
So O
even O
if O
OP O
is O
12.5% O
Jewish O
on O
paper, O
it O
would O
very O
likely O
show O
up O
in O
the O
results. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Even O
if O
Ashkenazi O
didn't O
show O
up O
in O
the O
results O
(It O
very O
likely O
would), O
if O
you're O
Serbian O
or O
Croatian O
and O
you're O
getting O
significant O
results O
that O
include O
a O
combination O
of O
Italian, O
Broadly O
Southern O
European, O
and O
Middle O
Eastern O
and O
North O
African, O
that's O
a O
very O
strong O
indicator O
of O
Sephardic O
ancestry O
as O
well. O
The O
odds O
that O
OP O
would O
see O
either O
Ashkenazi O
and/or O
this O
combination O
of O
Southern O
European O
and O
Middle O
Eastern O
if O
they O
are O
truly O
12.5% O
Jewish O
is O
virtually O
100%. O
[SEP]
A O
fully O
Jewish O
ancestor O
(Ashkenazi O
or O
otherwise) O
in O
the O
last O
4 O
generations O
is O
more O
likely O
than O
not O
to O
show O
up O
unambiguously O
in O
a O
DNA O
test. O
But O
especially O
if O
Ashkenazi, O
it's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
very O
helpful O
for O
discovering O
details O
of O
their O
background. O
[SEP]
Fourthed. O
I'm O
a O
professional O
and O
when O
people O
ask O
me O
what O
I O
use... O
I O
surprise O
them O
by O
saying O
that O
JewishGen O
is O
still O
my O
first O
(plus) O
stop O
[SEP]
Oh O
absolutely O
and O
also O
like O
you O
said O
it's O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
look O
at O
matches O
as O
well. O
For O
cases O
like O
this O
I'd O
recommend O
using O
Ancestry, O
this O
way O
you O
can O
build O
up O
a O
tree O
and O
with O
their O
DNA O
testing O
they O
match O
you O
to O
others O
who O
have O
also O
taken O
the O
tests O
and O
you O
can O
find O
ancestors O
you O
had O
no O
clue O
about. O
[SEP]

None O
of O
these O
people O
involved O
in O
this O
are O
republicans. O
Kanye, O
Fuentes, O
Milo...all O
have O
a O
history O
of O
hating O
the O
republican O
party. O
Even O
very O
conservative O
people O
like O
Matt O
Walsh O
and O
Shapiro O
wouldn't O
consider O
any O
of O
these O
people O
conservative O
or O
republican...just O
like O
Destiny O
wouldn't O
consider O
Jackson O
Hinkle O
or O
Jimmy O
Dore O
true O
leftists. O
This O
is O
a O
moronic O
post. O
Republicans B-Stance
love I-Stance
Israel I-Stance
and I-Stance
Jews I-Stance
even I-Stance
more I-Stance
then I-Stance
most I-Stance
Democrats. I-Stance
If O
anything O
a O
large O
part O
of O
the O
democratic O
party O
hates O
Zionism O
and O
is O
pretty O
outright O
anti-Semitic O
also. O
See O
Ilhan O
Omar O
and O
Rashid O
Talib. O
Also O
nobody O
"lets" O
people O
into O
parties O
homie...that O
isn't O
how O
this O
works. O
Obviously O
Shapiro O
would O
denounce O
everything O
YE O

saying...hes O
Jewish. O
This O
post O
is O
just O
partisan O
hackery. O
Sorry O
bro. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
really O
important O
to O
remember O
if O
Trump O
is O
convicted O
of O
anything O
and O
can't O
run. O
They'll O
try O
to O
disassociate O
from O
him O
and O
they O
can't O
be O
allowed O
to, O
hopefully O
democrats O
will O
keep O
track O

their O
asskissing O

deploy O
that O

Supporting B-Stance
Trump I-Stance
in I-Stance
2020 I-Stance
means I-Stance
supporting I-Stance
his I-Stance
baggage I-Stance

horde I-Stance
of I-Stance
conspiracy I-Stance
rotted I-Stance
brained I-Stance

The B-Stance
only I-Stance
Republicans I-Stance

repubs, I-Stance
even I-Stance
the I-Stance
most I-Stance
extreme I-Stance
ones, I-Stance
are I-Stance
all I-Stance
rhetoric, I-Stance
when I-Stance
it I-Stance
comes I-Stance
to I-Stance
policy I-Stance
they I-Stance
all I-Stance
voted I-Stance
to I-Stance
send I-Stance

[SEP]
I O
mean O
this O
whole O
thing O
transpired O
because O
of O
Trump O
2016. O
[SEP]
This O
is O
basically O
direct O
result O
of O
what O
happens O
when O
people O
treat O
politics O
like O
sports O
teams. O
With O
sports O
you O
want O
your O
opponent O
to O
be O
shit O
so O
you O
can O
win O
easily O
but O
with O
politics O
you O
actually O
want O
both O
sides O
to O
be O
as O
strong O
as O
possible O
so O
they O
feel O
like O
the O
only O
way O
for O
them O
to O
"beat O
their O
opponent" O
is O
by O
doing O
as O
good O
of O
a O
job O
as O
possible O
to O
appeal O
the O
voters. O
If O
you O
would O
have O
either O
side O
be O
complete O
crap O
and O
irredeemable O
for O
the O
public O
for O
some O
time, O
this O
would O
only O
lead O
to O
the O
leading O
side O
taking O
as O
much O
of O
an O
advantage O
of O
the O
position O
they O
are O
in O
as O
possible- O
fuck O
the O
ordinary O
people, O
they O
will O
still O
have O
to O
vote O
for O
them O
because O
in O
their O
perception O
the O
other O
side O
is O
even O
worse O
[SEP]
Reverse O
the O
roles O
for O
a O
second O
and O
let's O
say O
they O
met O
with O
Obama O
and O
not O
Trump. O
You O
think O
Shapiro O
would O
be O
like O
"Hey O
guys O
I'm O
sure O
Obama O
wanted O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
them O
so O
we O
shouldn't O
get O
on O
the O
Dems O
about O
this." O
Yeah O
no O
fucking O
way. O
I O
don't O
see O
why O
we O
should O
be O
more O
charitable O
than O
they O
would O
be. O
[SEP]
I O
mean O
no, O
I O
would O
never O
expect O
republicans O
to O
have O
spines O
or O
morals. O
We O
should O
never O
expect O
them O
to O
denounce O
any O
craziness O
in O
their O
party. O
Atleast O
they're O
dying O
in O
greater O
numbers O
than O
democrats. O
[SEP]
TIL O
supporting O
a O
candidate O
for O
a O
political O
position O
means O
you O
support O
literally O
everything O
halfway O
adjacent O
to O
them O
[SEP]
I O
mean O
Ben O
didn’t O
like O
trump O
from O
the O
get O
go O
either O
but O
he O
voted O
for O
him O
in O
2020 O
because O
the O
Republican O
Party O
aligns O
up O
with O
his O
ideals O
more. O
I O
know O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
that O
vote O
republican O
because O
they O
agree O
with O
them O
more O
on O
issues O
even O
if O
they O
hate O
the O
candidate. O
I O
did. O
Now O
in O
retrospect, O
after O
the O
election O
denial O
stuff O
and O
janurary O
6th O
stuff O
I O
won’t O
be O
supporting O
the O
Republican O
Party O
again, O
at O
least O
for O
a O
long O
time. O
But O
I O
get O
why O
some O
people O
vote O
for O
their O
party O
even O
if O
the O
candidate O
is O
not O
good. O
[SEP]

he O
loves O

One O
of O
the O
children O
in O
the O
third O
grade O
class O
I O
primarily O
work O
in O
shows O
significant O
signs O
of O
depression. O
She O
comes O
from O
a O
troubled O
home O
life O
and O
is O
wise O
beyond O
her O
years O
[SEP]
….in O
a O
really O
bad O
way. O
[SEP]
She O
speaks O
and O
behaves O
almost O
more O
like O
an O
angsty O
pre O
teen O
than O
an O
8 O
year O
old O
child. O
She O
struggles O
with O
coping O
skills O
and O
every O
time O
something O
doesn’t O
go O
her O
way O
she O
breaks O
down O
like O
the O
world O
is O
falling O
apart O
and O
everyone O
is O
out O
to O
get O
her. O
If O
someone O
hurts O
her O
on O
accident, O
she O
will O
not O
listen O
to O
them O
apologize, O
she O
just O
decides O
they O
did O
it O
on O
purpose O
and O
doesn’t O
want O
to O
hear O
otherwise. O
She O
acts O
like O
she’s O
horribly O
bullied O
but O
she O
has O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
who O
just O
kind O
of O
get O
fed O
up O
with O
her O
drama O
at O
times O
and O
don’t O
wanna O
hang O
out O
anymore. O
She O
does O
have O
days O
where O
other O
kids O
are O
mean O
to O
her, O
it’s O
a O
problem O
at O
our O
school, O
but O
she O
also O
can O
be O
a O
bully O
herself. O
[SEP]
How O
can O
I O
help O
raise O
the O
self O
esteem O
of O
a O
child O
who O
absolutely O
doesn’t O
want O
to O
be O
helped O
and O
seems O
to O
want O
the O
drama O
of O
being O
the O
victim? O
What O
can O
I O
do O
for O
her? O
[SEP]
Listen O
to O
her, O
whatever O
she O
needs O
or O
wants O
to O
talk O
about. O
As O
well O
as O
acting O
as O
a O
safety O
valve O
to O
burn O
off O
unwanted O
feelings, O
listening O
is O
the O
way O
we O
show O
someone O
they O
are O
likeable O
and O
worthy. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Without O
changing O
her O
core O
situation, O
there O
is O
a O
limit O
to O
what O
you O
can O
do O
to O
change O
her. O
But O
listening O
without O
trying O
to O
steer O
the O
conversation O
or O
impose O
a O
view O
should O
help O
her O
feel O
better O
and O
people O
who O
feel O
better O
tend O
to O
act O
better. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
will O
be O
capricious O
and O
unreasonable O
sometimes. O
That's O
ok. O
Allowing O
her O
to O
express O
her O
feelings O
means O
listening O
to O
some O
odd O
thoughts. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Secondary O
tack O
might O
be O
to O
increase O
her O
sense O
of O
autonomy: O
ask O
her O
advice O
on O
minor O
things, O
allow O
her O
to O
make O
decisions O
etc. O
And O
even O
if O
in O
reality O
she O
has O
little O
choice O
in O
some O
areas, O
ask O
her O
which O
thing O
she O
might O
like O
to O
do O
first O
and O
so O
on. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Lastly, O
I O
wish O
every O
troubled O
child O
had O
someone O
like O
you O
caring O
about O
them. O
Thank O
you O
for O
what O
you O
do. O
[SEP]
oh O
man O
thats O
like O
looking O
into O
a O
mirror O
haha. O
always O
helped O
to O
have O
teachers O
when O
they O
seemed O
like O
they O
really O
tried O
to O
make O
a O
connection O
with O
me O
and O
understand O
me O
and O
just O
be O
a O
safe O
space. O
maybe O
ask O
before O
or O
after O
class O
how O
theyre O
doin O
and O
that O
youre O
there O
for O
them O
or O
whatever. O
i O
remember O
that O
being O
a O
little O
awkward O
for O
me O
but O
its O
kinda O
nice O
to O
know O
at O
the O
same O
time O
[SEP]
I’m O
gonna O
be O
honest, O
I’m B-Health
autistic I-Health
and O
drama O
was O
something O
I O
struggled O
with O
growing O
up. O
I O
tended O
to O
use O
drama O
for O
attention O
because O
at O
school O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
thing O
that O
made O
the O
other O
girls O
care O
about O
one O
another. O
Whoever O
was O
the O
saddest O
that O
day O
had O
the O
most O
people O
surrounding O
them. O
So O
as O
an O
adult O
drama O
is O
something O
I O
struggle O
with O
because O
it’s O
hard O
for O
me O
not O
to O
see O
it O
as O
wanting O
attention. O
I O
find O
myself O
getting O
annoyed O
when O
something O
minor O
happens O
and O
she’s O
crying O
AGAIN, O
but O
I’m O
also O
trying O
really O
hard O
to O
change O
my O
viewpoint O
and O
figure O
out O
why O
the O
behavior O
is O
happening. O
[SEP]
I O
appreciate O
everyone’s O
help O
so O
far. O
[SEP]
But O
what O
is O
wrong O
with O
wanting O
attention? O
[SEP]
NAT! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
was O
kinda O
like O
this O
too O
when O
I O
was O
younger. O
I O
think O
a O
big O
part O
of O
it O
is O
that O
the O
kid O
probably O
does O
want O
attention, O
she O
just O
doesn’t O
know O
how O
to O
ask O
for O
it O
appropriately. O
I O
had O
all O
these O
feelings O
and O
things O
going O
on O
but O
I O
didn’t O
know O
how O
to O
ask O
anyone O
for O
help, O
so O
I O
did O
things O
that O
I O
thought O
might O
help O
me O
connect O
with O
people. O
Sometimes O
it O
worked O
in O
a O
way, O
but O
it’s O
hard O
to O
form O
meaningful O
connections O
when O
I O
wasn’t O
even O
fully O
aware O
I O
needed O
help. O
That O
was O
just O
my O
life. O
Hope O
that O
kinda O
makes O
sense O
:) O
[SEP]
Whenever O
we O
feel O
like O
a O
kid O
is O
out O
to O
get O
attention, O
replace O
the O
word O
attention O
with O
connection O
and O
that's O
probably O
the O
more O
true O
statement. O
[SEP]
Goes O
for O
more O
than O
just O
children! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
also, O
there's O
genuinely O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
wanting O
attention. O
It's O
a O
normal O
human O
need. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Many O
of O
us O
were O
brought O
up O
to O
feel O
like O
we O
are O
"too O
much." O
Like O
we O
want O
and O
need O
too O
much. O
We've O
taken O
a O
normal O
human O
need O
for O
attention O
and O
proclaimed O
it O
"too O
much," O
fought O
against O
it, O
then O
we O
see O
it O
in O
others O
& O
it O
brings O
up O
reactions O
in O
us. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
it's O
OK O
to O
want O
attention. O
It's O
OK O
to O
want O
comfort O
and O
soothing. O
And O
especially O
for O
children, O
they O
have O
to O
be O
taught O
how O
to O
self O
soothe O
and O
self O
comfort. O
And O
if O
nobody O
teaches O
them O
how...and O
nobody O
provides O
them O
external O
soothing O
and O
comfort... O
they O
will O
desperately O
be O
looking O
for O
it. O
Potentially O
their O
whole O
lives. O

Hi O
there, O
so O
I'm B-Other
travelling I-Other
to I-Other
Southeast I-Other
Asia I-Other
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
the O

year! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I'm O
not O
a O
fast O
paced O
kind O
of O
person O
so O
my O
original O
plan O
was O
to O
spend O
a O
few O
months O
exploring O
and O
living O
in O
Thailand, O
to O
really O
get O
a O
good O
experience O
of O
the O
place O
and O
be O
immersed O
in O
the O
culture. O
Of O
course O
I O
was O
open O
to O
visiting O
a O
couple O
of O
other O
countries O
as O
well O
whilst O
I O
am O
over O
there. O
There O
is O
a O
multiple O
entry O
tourist O
visa O
for O
Thailand O
that O
I O
can O
use O
for O
up O
to O
6 O
months, O
although O
I O
will O
have O
to O
leave O
the O
country O
after O
60 O
days O
before O
I O
can O
re-enter, O
which O
costs O
£150. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
However, O
I O
am O
also O
aware O
that O
currently O
I O
can O
spend O
45 O
days O
in O
Thailand O
on O
a O
visa O
exemption, O
and O
possibly O
another O
if O
I O
return O
(although O
I'm O
not O
100% O
sure O
on O
this). O
Considering O
this O
is O
free, O
and O
I'm O
quite O
keen O
now O
on O
visiting O
countries O
like O
Vietnam O
on O
a O
month-long O
visa, O
I O
am O
now O
undecided O
on O
whether O
its O
worth O
spending O
that O
much O
money O
for O
the O
long O
term O
Thailand O
visa O
if O
I O
can O
hop O
around O
other O
countries O
instead. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
What O
would O
people O
recommend? O
Is O
it O
worth O
getting O
the O
multiple O
entry O
visa? O
I O
know O
some O
people O
who O
go O
on O
a O
visa O
exemption O
to O
Thailand O
and O
say O
it O
isn't O
long O
enough! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
would O
also O
be O
helpful O
to O
know O
how O
many O
times O
you O
can O
get O
a O
visa O
exemption O
for O
Thailand. O

what O

every O

Last O

I O
threw O
him O
a O
party O
and O
he O
loved O
it! O
This O

I O
told O
him O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
but O
he O
didn’t O
give O
me O
any O
ideas O
so O
I O
book O
a O

reservations O
so O
he O
could O
pick O
one. O
I O
even O
took O
off O
work:( O
Today O
is O
his O
birthday O
and O
he O
just O
left O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
his O
friend O
and O
said O
he O
wouldn’t O
make O
dinner O
:-/. O
I O
texted O
him O
saying O
I O
am O
a O
little O
hurt O
ur O
not O
letting O
me O
give O
u O
something O
nice O
on O
your O

just O
never O

tell O
me O
when O
he O
is O

I O
was O

they O
did O
a O

I O

not O
see O
these O

If O
you O
want O

his O

He O
sounds O

I O
had O

him, O

he O
wasn't O
going O

Are O
you O

he's O

are O
you O

their O

Again, O
major, O

red O

[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
other O
issue O
is O
NOT O
that O
he O
wouldn’t O
let O
you O
do O
something O
nice O
for O
him, O
it’s O
that O
you O
made O
plans O
that O
he O
knew O
about O
in O
advance O
and O
he O
didn’t O
show O
up. O
If O
he O
does O
that O
for O
HIS O
birthday, O
he’s O
going O
to O
do O
it O
on O
other O
occasions O
that O
don’t O
revolve O
around O
him. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O

surprised O
that O
someone O
would O
propose O
to O
a O
partner O
then O
treat O
them O
like O
this O
to O
be O
honest. O
It O
sounds O
like O
either O
he’s O
pushing O
you O
out O
and O
a O
break O
up O
may O
be O
coming, O
or O
he’s O
cheating. O
[SEP]
NTA O
you O
were O
invited O
but O
he O
purposely O
had O
them O
schedule O
it O
when O
you O
couldn’t O

there? O
sweetie, O
you O
fiancé O
doesn’t O
like O
you O
very O
much O
[SEP]
Nta O

honestly O
it O
kinda O
sounds O
like O
he’s O
cheating O
on O
you O
and O
giving O
a O
bad O
excuse O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
he O
doesn't O
even O
like O
you O
tbh. O
Take O
a O
look O

your O

This O
behavior O
is O
not O
normal O

[SEP]
NTA, O

[SEP]
NTAH. O
He's O
being O
a O
jerk. O
If O
he O
wanted O
to O
spend O
time O
with O
his O
friends, O
fine O
but O
he O
needed O
to O
communicate O
with O
you O

you O
made O
it O
clear O
by O
repeatedly O
asking O
him O
what O
he O
wanted O
to O
do O
on O
his O
birthday O
that O
you O
wanted O
to O
spend O
time O
with O
him, O
so O
not O
discussing O
this O
with O

is O
rude O
af. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That, O
combined O

treat O

right. O

Someone O
mistreating O

how O
you O
feel, O

YWBTA O

He O

He O
is O
purposefully O

isn’t, O
I’m O
not O
sure O
how O

you O
kept O
asking O
him O
what O
to O
do. O
His O
answer O
was O
always O
"I O
don't O

So O
you O
made O
restaurant O
reservations. O
Did O
he O
know O
you O
made O
those O
reservations? O
Not O
mind O
reading O

the O

How O
come O
that O
the O
status O

responsability O
change O
immediatly O
after O
getting O

I O

my O

all O

he O
will O
have O
as O
a O

(except O

I O
don´t O
get O

He O

Barely O

he’s O
either O

OP O

a O

scheduled O
for O

his O

can’t O

this O

See. O
This. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
what O

is O
just O
space O

Bingo. O
This O
was O
my O
thought O
as O
well. O
OP O
he O
is O
telling O
you O
blatantly O
that O
you O
are O
not O
a O
priority O
to O
him. O
Be O
wise O
and O
listen. O
[SEP]
I’m O
wondering O
if O
there O
was O
a O
proposal O
at O
all O
or O
if O
this O
is O
just O
a O
title O
that O
was O
given O
to O
him. O
Because O
he O
sounds O
like O
a O
FWB, O
not O
a O
fiance. O
[SEP]
Even O
if O
he O
didn’t O
know O
there O
were O
firm O
plans, O
he O
did O
know O
she O
was O
wanting O
to O
plan O
something. O
So O
he’s O
still O
the O
AH O
because O
then O
he O
supposedly O
made O
plans O
but O
didn’t O
include O
her. O
[SEP]
He O
definitely O
knew O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
try O
this O
new O
buffet O
[SEP]
It O
basically O
because O
there O
have O
been O
other O
times O
he O
has O
promised O
me O
something O
then O
went O
with O
his O
friends O
[SEP]
Does O
she O
need O
to….it’s O
his O
birthday O
[SEP]
Most O
normal O

[SEP]
Or O
know O

Your O

suck O
[SEP]
The O
behaviour O
definitely O
screams O
FWB O
but O
if O
they O
aren’t O
actually O
engaged O
and O
OP O
just O
calls O
refers O
to O
him O
as O
her O
fiancé, O
that O
would O
be O
really O
odd O
on O
OP’s O
part O
[SEP]
She's O
said O
he O
definitely O
knew, O
so O
it's O
not O
really O
relevant. O
But O
I O
enjoy O
discussing O
possibilities O
and O
assume O
you O
do O
as O
well O
since O
you O
responded O
after O
she O
clarified. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
she O
never O
made O
it O
clear O
what O
the O
plans O
were O
then O
he's O
not O
wrong O
for O
thinking O
there O
aren't O
any. O
Not O
everyone O
celebrates O
their O
birthday O
on O
their O
actual O
birthday. O
Perhaps O
he O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
weekend O
thing. O
Or O
perhaps O
he O
thought O
she O
would O
do O
something O
but O
then O
she O
was O
home O
and O
nothing, O
nothing, O
nothing O
so O
when O
his O
friends O
invited O
him O
to O
something O
he O
frustratedly O
picked O
something O
over O
nothing. O
He's O
not O
a O
mind-reader O
and O
shouldn't O
be O
blamed O
for O
her O
lack O
of O
communication. O
It's O
his O
birthday, O
he O
can O
spend O
it O
how O
he O
wants. O
He O
didn't O
break O
plans O
with O
her O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
his O
friends O
because O
he O
didn't O
know O
there O
were O
plans. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
How O
often O
do O
we O
see O
people O
here O
with O
his O
story? O
"I O
always O
do O
a O
ton O
for O
his O
birthday O
and O
this O
year O
I'm O
sitting O
home O
waiting O
for O
anything O
to O
happen. O
He O
even O
has O
the O
day O
off O
of O
work, O
but O
so O
far O
all O
he's O
done O
is O
watch O
a O
movie O
by O
himself. O
My O
friends O
invited O
me O
to O
go O
out O
but O
I O
said O
no O
because O
I'm O
sure O
he'll O
do O
something. O
Well O
reddit, O
he O
didn't. O
We O
got O
in O
a O
big O
fight O
at O
bedtime O
and O
he O
says O
I'm O
TA O
for O
blaming O
him O
that O
I O
didn't O
go O
with O
my O
friends. O
He O
never O
said O
we O
had O
plans O
so O
it's O
my O
fault O
for O
assuming. O
He O
says O
he O
had O
reservations O
at O
a O
hotel O
for O
us O
for O
this O
weekend O
but O
now O
he's O
cancelling O
because O
he's O
mad O
at O
me." O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
there's O
no O
communication O
then O
that's O
the O
problem. O
He's O
not O
at O
fault O
for O
her O
lack O
of O
communication. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Again, O
all O
hypothetical O
as O
she's O
stated O
that O
he O
did O
know. O
[SEP]
I’m O
sorry O
but O
if B-Husband_BF
my I-Husband_BF
husband I-Husband_BF
ignores I-Husband_BF
it I-Husband_BF
my O
birthday O
was O
coming O
up O
and O
didn’t O
even O
acknowledge O
it O
and O
then O
expected O
me O
to O
be O
free O
and O
not O
make O
plans, O
I’d O
be O
perfectly O
in O
the O
right O
to O
do O
that. O
When O
you O
plan O
to O
surprise O
someone O
you O
have O
to O
actually O
make O
sure O
they’re O
available. O
So O
it’s O
actually O
very O
important O
to O
know O
if O
she O
asked O
or O
told O
him O
that O
she O
made O
plans O
for O
him. O
[SEP]
On O
the O
contrary... O
[SEP]
I O
totally O
agree. O
However O
I O
have O
read O
stories O
about O
people O
somehow O
assuming O
they’re O
engaged O
when O
they’re O
really O
not. O
[SEP]
I O
completely O
see O
your O
point O
and O
don’t O
necessarily O
disagree O
with O
that O
possibility. O
However, O
I O
did O
read O
another O
post O
by O
her O
from O
a O
little O
over O
a O
month O
ago. O
I O
think O
that O
they O
are O
not O
on O
the O
same O
page O
in O
terms O
of O
where O
they O
are O
in O
their O
relationship. O
I O
think O
she O
views O
their O
relationship O
as O
more O
serious O
than O
he O
does. O
[SEP]
I O
agree O
she O
should O
have O
told O
him O
and O
it’s O
not O
clear O
if O
OP O
told O
him O
but O
still O
he O
should O
have O
at O
least O
asked O
or O
known O
that O
she O
would O
plan O
something O
[SEP]
Plus O
with O
the O
additional O
information O
of O
hun O
planning O
stuff O
without O
her O
[SEP]
In O
this O

something O
else. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
agree, O
they O
don't O
seem O
like O
they're O
on O
the O
same O
page. O
Honestly O
I O
think O
that's O
usually O
the O
case O

World O

issue O
[SEP]
So, O
the O
thing O
is O
that O
I’m B-Race_Nationality
Swiss I-Race_Nationality
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
vote O
for O
Switzerland, O
but: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
First O
time O
I O
missed O
it O
bc O
lack O
of O
communication O
on O
CoD O
(didn’t O
know O
you O
could O
vote O
for O
your O
country O
in O
game) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Second O
time O
I O
think O
I O
was O
too O
late O
for O
the O
vote O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
now O
I O
tried O
to O
vote O
when O
I O
came O
back O
from O
work O
(7pm O
UTC+1) O
but O
I O
only O
had O
the O
option O
to O
vote O
for O
Brazil. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Can O
I O
even O
vote O
for O
Switzerland O
or O
is O
this O
another O
bug O
on O
the O
bug O
list O
this O
game O
has O
? O
[SEP]
They O
chose O
six O
matches O
for O
the O
contest O
- O
tomorrow’s O
match O
is O
Brazil O
v. O
Cameroon. O
If O
you O
missed O
your O
chance O
earlier O
then O
it’s O
too O
late. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Edit: O
AFAIK, O
Switzerland O
was O
never O
even O
a O
part O
of O
the O
contest. O
[SEP]
There O
is O
no O
bug, O
COD O
selected O
6 O
matches O
to O
include O
in O
this O
promotion, O
Switzerland O
was O
never O
one O
of O
them. O
[SEP]
So O
no O
Swiss O
calling O
card O
or O
anything O
? O
[SEP]
Not O
yet O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know. O
I’m O
sure O
they O
could O
add O
it O
in O
the O
future, O
but O
there O
were O
only O
12 O
countries O
in O
total O
for O
this O
little O
betting O
game. O
And O
only O
the O
winners O
get O
their O
cards/anthems O
distributed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
England/US O
(since O
it O
was O
a O
draw), O
Argentina, O
Spain/Germany O
(another O
draw), O
Ghana, O
Tunisia, O
and O
the O
winner O
of O
Brazil/Cameroon O
tomorrow. O
[SEP]
Wonder O
how O
many O
people O
will O
get O
the O
4 O
matches O
bonus O
reward. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
2 O
are O
a O
given O
(draws) O
and O
probably O
Argentina O
winning O
was O
likely, O
but O
Mexico O
weren't O
actually O
that O
low O
in O
the O
rankings. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
However O
I O
didn't O
see O
Ghana O
and O
Tunisia O
winning. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
way O
things O

gone O
there O
might O
only O

it. O

Ever O
since O
I O
was O
a O
kid O
(I'm B-Age
37), I-Age
I O
felt O
this O
sort O
of O
restlessness. O
Everyone O
around O
me O
always O
told O
me O
to O
get O
a O
job, O
marry, O
settle O
down. O
My O
first O
marriage O
was O
a O
complete O
fuck O
up O
(through O
my O

actions) O
and O
my O
life O
was O
falling O
a O
part. O
Then, O
something O
within O
me O
sort O
of, O
snapped O
into O
place. O
Fast O
forward O
a O
few O
years O
and O
I'm O
just O
overall, O
happy. O
Sure, O
I O
fuck O
up O
here O
and O
there O
(again, O
self O
doing) O
but O
I O
think O
that's O
to O
remind O
me O
that O
I'm O
human O
. O
As O
long O
you O
keep O
it O
moving O
and O
DOING O
SOMETHING O
to O
better O
yourself O
as O

Some O

[SEP]
[SEP]
- O
Are O
you O

And O
what O
approx O
is O
your O

income? O
Because O
high O
income O
people O
should O
invest O
in O
their O
traditional O

first O
and O
foremost, O
because O
of O
the O

What O

would O

in O
if O
you O

on O
your O
own? O
Individual O
stocks? O
Index O
funds? O
You're O
new O

so O
why O
do O
you O
think O
you O
should O
go O
it O

[SEP]
Good O

I O
would O
probably O
do O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
everything, O
individual O
stocks, O
dividends, O
and O
index O
funds. O
Yes, O
you O
are O
right, O
probably O
not O
the O
best O
idea. O
[SEP]
My O
pleasure. O
Good O
luck! O
[SEP]
Stick O
with O
the O
401k. O
You O
get O
a O
great O
tax O
advantage O
and O
possibly O
a O
company O
match. O
These O
will O
put O
you O
far O
ahead O
of O
trying O
to O
invest O
alone O
in O
a O
non O
tax O
advantaged O
account. O
And O
you'll O
likely O
take O
a O
lot O
more O
risk, O
meaning O
you O
are O
likely O
to O
lose O
a O
lot O
more O
money. O
[SEP]
Just O
federal O
taxes, O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
in O
the O
22% O
tax O
bracket O
with O
your O
income. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
6% O
of O
$72,500 O
is O
$4,350. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
When O
you O
invest O
$4,350 O
into O
your O
traditional O
401k, O
that O
money O
isn't O
taxed O
-- O
which O
means O
that O
had O
you O
not O
contributed O
that O
money O
into O
your O
401k, O
it O
would O
be O
coming O
to O
you O
in O
your O
paycheck... O
but O
you'd O
only O
get O
$3,393 O
of O
it O
(because O
22% O
of O
that O
$4,350 O
would O
have O
gone O
to O
the O
IRS). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Then O
let's O
say O
that O
your O
employer O
offers O
50% O
match O
on O
your O
6% O
contribution. O
That's O
$2,175. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Contribution O
into O
your O
401k: O
$6,525 O
a O
year. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
While O
to O
invest O
on O
your O
own, O
outside O
the O
401k, O
at O
the O
same O
financial O
hit: O
$3,393 O
a O
year. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
really O
want O
to O
invest O
on O
your O
own, O
just O
make O
sure O
you O
get O
the O
full O
6% O
match O
on O
your O
employer's O
401k, O
and O
then O
invest O
inside O
a O
Roth O
IRA O
with O
spare O
cash. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
Roth O
IRA O
is O
just O
a O
tax-advantaged O
investment O
vehicle, O
and O
you O
can O
invest O
in O
individual O
stocks, O
dividend O
stocks, O
index O
funds O
etc. O
inside O
of O
it. O
[SEP]
Thanks O
so O
much O

your O

We O

8 O

We O
reconnected O
almost O
2 O

During B-Time

8 I-Time

I B-Pet
adopted I-Pet
a I-Pet

from O

we O
both O
work O

more O

not O
my O

hours O

When O
I O
leave O

I B-Pet
put I-Pet
my I-Pet
dog I-Pet
into I-Pet
a I-Pet

(something O
I O
hate O
doing O
but O
if O
I O
don't O
she O
likes O
to O
get O
into O
the O
garbage O
out O
of O
boredom). O
The O
only O
thing O
I O
ask O
of O
her O
is O
when O
she O
is O
done O
with O
her O
30 O
minute O
break O
(We O
have O
a O
household O
policy O
that O
when O
you O
get O
home O
you O
take O
30 O
minutes O
to O
yourself O

relax) O
then O
take O
the O
dog O
out O
so O
she O
can O
do O
her O
business. O
[SEP]

For O
the O
last O

year O

half O
roughly, O
my O

has O
gotten O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
getting O
home O
and O
getting O
on O
a O
game O
or O
falling O
asleep O
before O
taking O
her O
out. O
So O
when O
I O
get O
home O
the O
dog O
is O
still O
in O
her O
crate O
and O
there O
would O
be O
pee O
and O
poop O
in O
it O
and O
I'd O
have O
to O
clean O
it O
up. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Last O
night O
was O
one O
of O
those O
nights O
and O
the O
dog O
hasn't O
been O
feeling O
well. O
So O
her O
poop O
is...liquid. O
There O
was O
poop O
EVERYWHERE O
in O
the O
crate O
and O
on O
the O
dog. O
I O
lost O
it. O
I O
busted O
my O
way O
into O
her O
room O
(thinking O
she O
fell O
asleep O
again O
so O
thinking O
I'd O
have O
to O
make O
as O
much O
noise O
as O
possible O
to O
wake O
her O
up). O
All O
I O
asked O
was O
if O
the O
dog O
has O
been O
out O
yet. O
Granted O
in O
a O
yelling O
tone. O
She O
took O
the O
dog O
out O
and O
when O
she O
came O
back O
in O
I O
asked O
her O
what O
her O
issue O
is. O
I O
don't O
ask O
her O
for O
rent, O
though O
she O
pays O
half O
anyways. O
I O
don't O
ask O
her O
to O
help O
clean, O
she O
barely O
does O
that. O
All O
I O
ask O
is O
for O
her O
to O
take O
the O
dog O
out. O
She O
just O
kept O
apologizing O
and O
said O
she O
lost O
track O
of O
time O
from O
being O
on O
her O
game. O
I'm O
a O
gamer O
as O
well O
but O
if O
I O
know O
something O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
I O
do O
that O
first O
then O
get O
online. O
I O
told O
her O
that O
if O
she O
can't O
do O
that O
then O
she O
is O
gonna O
have O
to O
have O
to O
find O
somewhere O
else O
to O
stay. O
Or O
I O
leave. O
She O
got O
mad O
at O
me O
calling O
me O
an O
asshole O
because O
she O
can't O
afford O
to O
live O
on O
her O
own. O
And O
that O
she O
knows O
she O
messed O
up O
but O
I O
don't O
need O
to O
take O
it O
that O
far. O

I O

for O
4 O

If O
I O
walk O
her O
when O
I O
get O
home O
and O
she O
has O
been O
in O

when O
I O

I O

than O
telling O
me O
I O
need O
to O
rehome O
her O
how O
about O
some O
suggestions O
on O
how O
to O
fix O
boredom. O
I O
did O
not O
go O
into O
her O
background O
because O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
it O
necessary O
to O
the O
original O
post. O
She O
was O
almost O
3 O
years O
old O
when O
I O
took O
her O
in. O
She O
was O
not O
house O
trained O
whatsoever. O
Had O
no O
obedience O
training. O
Was O
not O
fixed O
nor O
had O
ever O
had O
shots O
since O
she O
was O
still O
a O
puppy. O
She O
had O
bite O
marks O
and O
still O
has O
scars O
from O
other O
dogs O
all O
over O
her. O
Especially O
on O
her O
neck O
and O
right O
hind O
leg. O
She O
is O
terrified O
of O
small O
dogs O
and O
hates O
big O
dogs. O
I O
got O
her O
trained, O
fixed, O
updated O
shots, O
and O
mostly O
house O
trained O
while O
still O
working O
40 O
hour O
work O

The O
only O
huge O
issue O
I'm O

now O
is O
her O
boredom O
or O
maybe O
it's O
anxiety. O

left O

her O

Some O
back O
story: O
my O
sister O
(26F) B-Age_Gender
and O
I O
(28F) B-Age_Gender
grew O
up O
in O
an O
abusive O
household. O
We O
lost O
contact O
with O
eachother O
for O
almost O
8 O
years. O
We O
reconnected O
almost O
2 O
years O
ago O
and O
decided O
to O
move O
in O
together. O
During B-Time
that I-Time
8 I-Time
years I-Time
I B-Pet
adopted I-Pet
a I-Pet
pitbull I-Pet
from O
an O
abusive O
and O
negative O
environment. O
She O
came O
with O
me O
when O
I O
moved O
in O
with O
my O
sister. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
we O
both O
work O
full O
time O
and O
more O
often O
than O
not O
my O
sister O
is O
home O
hours O
before O
I O
am. O
When O
I O
leave O
for O
work O
I B-Pet
put I-Pet
my I-Pet
dog I-Pet
into I-Pet
a I-Pet
crate I-Pet
(something O
I O
hate O
doing O
but O
if O
I O
don't O
she O
likes O
to O
get O
into O
the O
garbage O
out O
of O
boredom). O
The O
only O
thing O
I O
ask O
of O
her O
is O
when O
she O
is O
done O
with O
her O
30 O
minute O
break O
(We O
have O
a O
household O
policy O
that O
when O
you O
get O
home O
you O
take O
30 O
minutes O
to O
yourself O
and O
relax) O
then O
take O
the O
dog O
out O
so O
she O
can O
do O
her O
business. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
the O
last O
year, O
year O
and O
half O
roughly, O
my O
sister O
has O
gotten O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
getting O
home O
and O
getting O
on O
a O
game O
or O
falling O
asleep O
before O
taking O
her O
out. O
So O
when O
I O
get O
home O
the O
dog O
is O
still O
in O
her O
crate O
and O
there O
would O
be O
pee O
and O
poop O
in O
it O
and O
I'd O
have O
to O
clean O
it O
up. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Last O
night O
was O
one O
of O
those O
nights O
and O
the O
dog O
hasn't O
been O
feeling O
well. O
So O
her O
poop O
is...liquid. O
There O
was O
poop O
EVERYWHERE O
in O
the O
crate O
and O
on O
the O
dog. O
I O
lost O
it. O
I O
busted O
my O
way O
into O
her O
room O
(thinking O
she O
fell O
asleep O
again O
so O
thinking O
I'd O
have O
to O
make O
as O
much O
noise O
as O
possible O
to O
wake O
her O
up). O
All O
I O
asked O
was O
if O
the O
dog O
has O
been O
out O
yet. O
Granted O
in O
a O
yelling O
tone. O
She O
took O
the O
dog O
out O
and O
when O
she O
came O
back O
in O
I O
asked O
her O
what O
her O
issue O
is. O
I O
don't O
ask O
her O
for O
rent, O
though O
she O
pays O
half O
anyways. O
I O
don't O
ask O
her O
to O
help O
clean, O
she O
barely O
does O
that. O
All O
I O
ask O
is O
for O
her O
to O
take O
the O
dog O
out. O
She O
just O
kept O
apologizing O
and O
said O
she O
lost O
track O
of O
time O
from O
being O
on O
her O
game. O
I'm O
a O
gamer O
as O
well O
but O
if O
I O
know O
something O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
I O
do O
that O
first O
then O
get O
online. O
I O
told O
her O
that O
if O
she O
can't O
do O
that O
then O
she O
is O
gonna O
have O
to O
have O
to O
find O
somewhere O
else O
to O
stay. O
Or O
I O
leave. O
She O
got O
mad O
at O
me O
calling O
me O
an O
asshole O
because O
she O
can't O
afford O
to O
live O
on O
her O
own. O
And O
that O
she O
knows O
she O
messed O
up O
but O
I O
don't O
need O
to O
take O
it O
that O
far. O

Thank O
you O
for O
your O

The O
most O
she O
is O
in O
the O
crate O
is O
(if O
my O
sister O
walks O
her O
when O
she O
gets O
home) O
4 O
or O
5 O
hours. O
If O
she O
is O
still O
there O
when O
I O
get O
home O
it's O
9 O
hours O
roughly. O
I O
hate O
both. O
I O
do O
NOT O
want O
to O
have O
her O
in O
the O
cage. O
But O
at O
this O
time O
it's O
the O
only O
option. O
I O
have O
tried O
training O
her O
to O
be O
"house O
trained" O
in O
a O
way. O
And O
we O
got O
to O
a O
place O
where O
I O
could O
leave O
her O
for O
an O
hour O
alone. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also O
I'm O
not O
a O
landlord. O
I'm O
a O
tenant O
as O
well. O
My B-Family
sister I-Family
snd I-Family
I I-Family
live I-Family
together I-Family
as I-Family
tenants. I-Family
Then O
we O
pay O
the O
landlord. O
I O
paid O
for O
the O
2.6k$ O
for O
the O
deposit. O
And O
at O
this O
point O
I O
have O
serious O
doubts O
I'm O
getting O
it O
back. O
This O
place O
is O
too O
small O
for O
the O
dog O
but O
it O
was O
the O
only O
place O
that O
had O
no O
dog O
restrictions. O
I O
just O
have O
to O
pay O
a O
"pet O
fee" O
every O
month O
and O
have O
liability O
insurance O
and O
show O
she O
is O
fixed O
and O
is O
updated O
on O
her O
shots. O
I'm O
waiting O
on O
a O
promotion O
from O
my O
work O
in O
4 O
months O
to O
be O
able O
to O
afford O
a O
home O
loan O
so O
I O
give O
this O
dog O
at O
least O
a O
yard O
to O
run O
around O
in. O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
give O
up O
something O
that O
has O
been O
with O
me O
since O
my O
lowest O
in O
my O

But O
I O
am O
prepared O
to O
if O
this O
promotion O
doesn't O
come O
to O
fruition. O
[SEP]
I O
was O
just O

this O
- O
my B-Pet
dogs I-Pet
go I-Pet
out I-Pet
as O
soon O
as O
I've O
set O
my O
bag O
down. O
It O

And O
I O

I O
have O

All O
3 O

I've O

I O
either O

had O

I O
have O
been O

just O
rehome O
her. O
But O
until O
then O
the O
dog O
is O
still O
here. O
And O
no O
she O
isn't O
in O
the O
crate O
all O
night. O
My O
schedule O
runs O
from O
10am-7/8pm. O
I O
walk O
her O
before O
I O
leave O
for O
work, O
when O
I O
get O
home, O
about O
an O

after O

one O

[SEP]
So O
what O
you're O
saying O
is O
people O
who O
work O
cannot O
have O
animals? O
Just O
wanna O
make O
sure O
I O
understand O
you O
correctly. O
Because O
by O
your O
way O
of O
wording O
anyone O
who O
works O
more O
than O
15-20 O
hours O
a O
week O
should O
not O
have O
pets. O
Or O
children O
for O
that O
matter. O
How O
do O
YOU O
suggest O
I B-Pet
help I-Pet
my I-Pet
dog I-Pet
from I-Pet
getting I-Pet
bored I-Pet
and I-Pet
ripping I-Pet
the I-Pet
whole I-Pet
house I-Pet
apart..AGAIN? I-Pet
I O
have O
tried O
everything O
from O
a O
specialist O
dog O
trainer O
to O
gross O
tasting O
sprays O
that O
"makes O
puppies O
uninterested O
in O
chewing O
things", O
to O
simply O
taking O
a O
trash O
out O
before O
I O
leave. O
This O
adorable O
dumbo O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
get O
into O
the O
cabinet O
where O
I O
kept O
(not O
anymore) O
cleaning O
chemicals. O
She O
almost O
died! O
I O
got O
home O
just O
in O
time O
and O
rushed O
her O
to O
the O
vet O
hospital O
and O
had O
her O
stomach O
pumped! O
She O
stayed O
there O
for O
almost O
a O
week O
for O
observation O
it O
was O
so O
bad. O
YOU O
may O
never O
had O
to O
use O
crates O
but O
I'm O
not O
you. O
And O
nor O
was O
I O
lucky O
enough O
to O
find O
this O
fur O
brain O
when O
she O
was O
still O
a O
puppy. O
I O
got O
her O
when O
she O
was O
almost O
3 O
years O
old O
and O
she O
wasn't O
house O
trained! O
*I* O
got O
her O
to O
be O
house O
trained. O
Or O
are O
least O
to O
a O
point O
where O
she O
can O
hold O
it O
longer O
than O
she O
originally O
could. O
As O
long O
as O
she O
gets O
walked O
every O
5/6 O
hours O
everything O
is O
fine. O
[SEP]
It O
was O
the O
original O
agreement O
that O
she O
wouldn't O
have O
to O
pay O
rent O
if O
she O
walks O
the O
dog O
a O
few O
times O
during O
the O
day. O
She O
decided O
on O
her O
own O
to O
pay O
half O
the O
rent O
when O
she O
got O
a O
pay O
raise. O
So O
she O
sends O
me O
money O
through O
zelle. O
But O
she O
said O
she'd O
still O
walk O
the O
dog O
when O
she O
gets O
home. O
And O
I O
agree O
it's O
not O
her O
responsibility. O
I'm O
just O
one O
of O
those O
that O
does O
what O
they O
say O
they O
are O
gonna O
do. O
If O
that O
makes O
sense. O
We O
are O
gonna O
talk O
about O
it O
when O
I O
get O
home O
tonight. O
But O
I'm O
just O
seeing O
if O
maybe O
I O
messed O
up O
our O
relationship O
too O
far O
over O
this..if O
that O
makes O
sense. O
Just O
so O
I O
have O
an O
idea O
on O
how O
I O
should O
talk O
to O
her. O

Even O
if O
the O

YOU O
have O
no O

a O

that O

it. O
you’re O
a O

why O

someone O

your O

of O
your O

you’d O

This O

you O

need O
within O
4 O
months O

with O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Besides O
that O

either O
the O
chance O
you O

what O

gigantic. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
believe O
they O
have O
to O
send O
within O
a O
few O
days O
and O
if O
they O
don’t O
it O
will O
get O
canceled O
automatically. O
Otherwise O
if O
they O
generated O
a O
shipping O

you O
will O
have O
to O
wait O
until O
the O
date O
it O
should O
have O
been O

[SEP]
Similar O

with O

But O

you O
should O
never O

the O

Usually O

gives O
a O
2 O

for O
the O

to O
be O

before O
you O
can O
ask O

This O
shows O
how O
much O
an O

this O

WHAT O
A O

The O

1 O

point, O
partially O
because O
we O
just O
enjoyed O
being O
together O
but O
also O
I B-Mental_Health
had I-Mental_Health
terrible I-Mental_Health
anxiety I-Mental_Health
and O
admittedly O
felt O
possessive O
over O
him. O
I O
knew O
they O
were O
still O
talking. O
He O
lied O
to O
me O
about O
going O
to O
see O
a O
friend O
to O
get O
him O
out O
of O
a O
bad O
situation O
with O
his O
"alcoholic O
dad", O
went O
to O
spend O
the O
night O
with O
her O
instead, O
and O
he O
still, O
to O
this O
day, O
will O
not O
tell O
me O
the O
truth. O
The O
only O
reason O
I O
know O
what O
actually O
happened O
is O
because O
she O
told O
me, O
and O
that O
the O
friend O
with O
the O
alcoholic O
dad O
is O
a O
family O
friend, O
and O
he O
is O
in O
fact O
not O
an O
alcoholic. O

Very O
early O
on O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
was O
pushing O
him O
into O
the O
next O
phase O
of O
our O
relationship. O
Getting O
our O
first O
place O
together, O
buying O
a O
ring, O
proposing... O
all O
of O
that O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
pushed O
him O
to O
do O
when O
maybe O
he O
wasn't O
ready? O
He O
did O
all O
of O
it, O
of O
course, O
he O
didn't O
have O
to, O
I O
never O
forced O
him. O
But O
he O
was O
never O
passionate. O
He O
went O
to O
my B-Family
parents I-Family
to O
ask O
for O
their O
"permission" O
(something O
we O
don't O
believe O
in O
now, O
but O
we O
were O
youngish), O
but O
didn't O
actually O
do O
it. O
Didn't O
plan O
a O
big O
proposal O
when O
he O
knew O
I O
wanted O
that, O
Just... O
didn't O
put O
thought O
into O
those O
things. O
I O
was O
fine O
with O
that O
because O
I O
thought O
maybe O
it O
just O
wasn't O
him, O
and O
I O
accepted O
him O
as O
he O
was. O
Looking O
back O
now O
though O
it O
does O
upset O
me. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
There O
were O
lots O
of O
things O
that O
bothered O
me O
though. O
He O
is O
very O
passive, O
doesn't O
make O
decisions, O
doesn't O
take O
initiative, O
things O
I O
didn't O
think O
were O
a O
big O
deal O
so O
I O
took O
the O
lead O
on O
most O
things O
in O
our O
life. O
I O
decided O
where O
we O
lived, O
our O
budgets, O
I O
took O
on O
the O
"mental O
load". O
I O
was O
fine O
with O
it. O
In O
the O
beginning O
he O
worked O
very O
long O
hours O
at O
a O
physically O
challenging O
job, O
and O
even O
though O
I O
was O
working O
full O
time, O
I O
was O
glad O
to O
do O
all O
of O
those O
things. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
From O
very O
early O
on, O
I O
knew O
he O
lacked O
emotional O
intimacy. O
There O
weren't O
many O
emotional O
conversations. O
No O
cuddling O
just O
to O
cuddle. O
No O
words O
of O
affirmation O
(or O
any O
of O
the O
other O
love O
languages O
for O
that O
matter O
lol). O
Everything O
was O
"fine" O
always. O
DOn't O
get O
me O
wrong. O
He O
is O
a O
great O
man. O
But O
I'd O
say, O
very O
emotionally O
immature. O
Again, O
it O
wasn't O
an O
issue O
before O
because O
we O
didn't O
have O
any O
"real" O
responsibilities O
- O
car O
payments, O
kids, O
pets, O
etc. O
And O
I O
didn't O
need O
the O
emotional O
support, O
emotional O
intimacy, O
communication, O
etc. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Since O
we've B-Family
had I-Family
kids, I-Family
we I-Family
have I-Family
two I-Family
(7 B-Age
and I-Age
2), I-Age
these O
things O
are O
bigger O
issues O
for O
me. O
Taking O
on O
the O
mental O
load O
is O
more O
difficult O
when O
we O
have O
kids O
and O
pets. O
For O
the O
longest O
time, O
I O
was O
doing O
all O
the O
cleaning, O
planning, O
cooking, O
etc. O
Then O
he O
started O
a O
different O
job O
that O
was O
way O
less O
hours, O
not O
physically O
demanding, O
and O
he O
could O
be O
home O
more. O
He O
didn't O
pick O
up O
any O
slack O
or O
chores O
or O
anything. O
We O
talked, O
he O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
start O
doing O
more O
around O
the O
house. O
Which O
is O
great, O
I'm O
thankful. O
BUT, O
I O
still O
have O
to O
initiate O
the O
tasks O
most O
of O
the O
time, O
unless O
it O
effects O
him O
directly O
(like O
laundry). O
We O
tried O
the O
Fair O
Play O
game, O
that O
helped O
a O
bit, O
but O
again, O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
forcing O
him O
to O
participate. O
Dragging O
him O
along. O
With O
the O
kids, O
I'm O
the O
one O
planning O
and O
executing O
outings, O
and O
then O
I O
have O
to O
drag O
him O
out O
to O
come O
with O
us. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
no O
emotional O
support O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
kids. O
I O
am O
the O
one O
that O
makes O
rules, O
bedtimes, O
pushes O
showers O
and O
teeth O
brushing. O
Makes O
appointments. O
Remembers O
vaccines, O
clothing O
sizes... O
When O
something O
goes O
wrong, O
he O
turns O
it O
around O
on O
me O
and O
it's O
my O
fault. O
But O
then O
I O
feel O
set O
up O
because O
he O
won't O
make O
decisions O
or O
help O
out, O
so O
of O
course O
it's O
my O
fault O
because O
he O
doesn't O
do O
anything. O
He O
won't O
apologize. O
Ever. O
At O
all. O
He O
wrestles O
with O
our O
oldest O
and O
doesn't O
stop O
when O
he O
asks. O
Doesn't O
apologize O
if O
oldest O
is O
hurt. O
Is O
just O
cruel O
sometimes O
with O
us.He O
claims O
our O
son O
lies O
about O
things, O
stupid O
things, O
and O
then O
doesn't O
apologize O
when O
he's O
proven O
wrong. O
He O
does O
not O
praise O
or O
acknowledge O
good O
work O
from O
the O
kids O
or O
me. O
It's O
like O
he O
only O
has O
negative O
thoughts, O
assumes O
the O
worst, O
etc. O
Doesn't O
thank O
anyone. O
I O
can't O
disagree O
with O
him O
at O
all. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
His O
biggest O
gripe O
is O
that O
we O
aren't O
physically O
intimate O
enough. O
Anytime O
I O
try O
to O
talk O
about O
our O
issues, O
the O
issues O
I O
have, O
he O
says O
he O
would O
be O
happier, O
more O
active O
in O
our O
lives, O
if O
we O
had O
more O
sx. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
For O
a O
long O
time O
after O
our O
marriage, O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
asexual. O
I O
had O
no O
desire O
or O
urge O
at O
all. O
But O
I'm O
learning O
that O
all O
of O
these O
things O
that O
I O
thought O
didn't O
matter, O
that O
I O
ignored, O
actually O
do O
matter O
to O
me. O
And O
they O
push O
me O
away O
from O
him. O
I O
don't O
feel O
respected. O
I O
don't O
feel O
loved O
(I O
asked O
him O
during O
our O
last O
serious O
conversation O
whether O
he O
still O
loved O
me. O
He O
said O
he O
"tries O
to O
love" O
me. O
etc?). O
I O
don't O
feel O
appreciated. O
I'm O
learning O
that O
I O
can't O
force O
myself O
to O
be O
physical O
in O
a O
relationship O
that O
doesn't O
have O
those O
things. O
Yes, O
I've O
communicated O
all O
of O
this O
with O
him. O
He O
said O
he O
didn't O
know O
how, O
or O
what O
to O
do, O
or O
that O
he O
was O
already O
giving O
his O
all. O
I O
take O
100% O
of O
the O
responsibility O
on O
this. O
I O
don't O
want O
him O
to O
be O
in O
a O
relationship O
that O
the's O
not O
fulfilled O
in, O
and O
it O
is O
100% O
my O
fault O
that O
we O
aren't O
sexual. O
I O
knew O
all O
of O
these O
things O
were O
issues O
before O
we O
were O
married, O
and O
I O
ignored O
them. O
That's O
on O
me. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
At O
the O
same O
time O
though, O
I O
keep O
hearing O
"If O
he O
wanted O
to, O
he O
would." O
If O
he O
loved O
me, O
cared O
for O
me, O
appreciated O
me, O
he O
would O
be O
making O
an O
effort. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
There O
is O
no O
effort. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
I O
am O
also O
at O
fault O
in O
this O
relationship O
situation. O
Don't O
get O
me O
wrong. O
I B-Mental_Health
have I-Mental_Health
ADHD, I-Mental_Health
Anxiety, I-Mental_Health
depression, I-Mental_Health
I'm O
terrible O
at O
managing O
money O
and O
budgets. O
I O
have O
my O
own O
issues. O
But O
I O
do O
try. O
So O
hard. O
I'm B-Other
in I-Other
therapy. I-Other
I'm I-Other
on I-Other
meds. I-Other
I'm O
really O
trying. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
I'm O
fucking O
exhausted O
of O
feeling O
like O
I'm O
the O
only O
one O
trying O
here. O
If O
all O
of O
these O
red O
flags O
that O
I O
ignored O
14 O
years O
ago O
still O
exist, O
I O
can't O
expect O
him O
to O
change O
to O
become O
what O
I O
need. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But, O
we O
have O
kids. O
I O
still O
have O
hope O
that O
things O
will O
get O
better. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
they O
haven't O
got O
better. O
Am O
I O
the O
shitty O
one O
here? O
Can O
I O
just O
get O
some O
input? O
Validation? O
Or O
slap O
me O
with O
some O
reality? O
Being O
an O
adult O
really O
fucking O
sucks. O
[SEP]
My O
thoughts O
are. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
His O
ex O
might O
have O
been O
the O
love O
of O
his O
life O
fantasy O
type O
of O
thing. O
He O
essentially O
was O
dating O
you O
and O
slept O
with O
his O
ex, O
possibly O
in O
hopes O
of O
something O
becoming O
more O
again. O
Not O
nice. O
But O
you O
need O
to O
let O
go O
of O
the O
past O
and O
it O
was O
14 O
years O
ago. O
He O
does O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
issues O
though. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
he's O
not O
feeling O
it O
and O
neither O
are O
you. O
It's O
unlikely O
he O
will O
change O
and O
it's O
unlikely O
you O
will O
want O
to O
jump O
into O
bed O
with O
him. O
Does O
that O
mean O
divorce? O
Probably O
not. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
you O
need O
some O
self-care O
outside O
of O
this O
constellation. O
Pick O
up O
some O
hobbies, O
concentrate O
on O
that. O
You O
need O
to O
stop O
caring O
so O
much, O
analysing O
and O
picking O
up O
the O
slack, O
He O
complains O
about O
you O
doing O
too O
much, O
not O
enough, O
not O
perfect O
enough, O
it O
needs O
to O
go O
over O
your O
head O
and O
he O
needs O
to O
step O
up O
and O
you O
slow O
down. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
will O
likely O
not O
change. O
He O
seems O
really O
reactive O
and O
that's O
probably O
the O
turn O
off O
for O
you O
sexually, O
it's O
not O
that O
you're O
asexual, O
it's O
that O
you're O
not O
connected. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
here's O
what O
you O
do: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Since O
he's O
reactive O
maybe O
just O
love O
him O
for O
who O
he O
is O
and O
accept O
him. O
Warts O
and O
all. O
If O
you O
can O
manage O
that, O
great! O
If O
you O
can't, O
you O
need O
to O
learn O
this O
for O
yourself. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Sex O
can O
only O
come O
with O
connection. O
He O
has O
hobbies? O
Let O
him O
carry O
them O
out, O
leave O
him O
be. O
If O
he O
wants O
to O
hang O
out O
with O
you, O
ok, O
watch O
his O
movies, O
eat O
the O
foods O
he O
likes. O
Find O
his O
jokes O
funny O
again. O
If O
not, O
the O
grown O
man O
has O
friends O
and O
you O
go O
live O
his O
life. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
there's O
no O
give O
without O
take. O
He O
needs O
to O
do O
more O
things O
he's O
good O
at, O
maybe O
cleaning, O
maybe O
task, O
without O
you O
telling O
him O
to. O
You O
need O
to O
take O
whatever O
you O
feel O
you O
need. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
do O
loads O
to O
build O
a O
connection O
without O
giving O
in O
to O
sex. O
Sex O
will O
come O
with O
a O
decent O
connection O
and O
once O
it O
feel O
natural O
again, O
things O
will O
start O
on O
a O
better O
foot O
than O
now. O
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
you O
guys O
need O
marriage O
counseling O
asap. O
Good O
luck O

Second O
cycle! O
First O
cycle O
5 O
days O

5mg, O
failed O
to O
produce O
a O

took O
three O
additional O
days O
and O
didn’t O
progress O
at O
all O
so O
the O
cycle O
was O
cancelled. O
On O
my O
third O
day O
at O
7.5, O
hoping O
and O
praying O
it O
succeeds. O
[SEP]
I O
started O
taking O
it O
from O
day O
8. O
Im O
really O
worried O
if O
that's O
okay. O
My O
doctor O
she O
just O
told O
me O
to O
start O
it. O
Didn't O
tell O
me O
that O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
from O
day O
3. O

Good O

Yes O

I O

cried O
several O

imagine O
myself O

I O

How O
are O
you O
feeling O
about O
it?? O
I O
get O
such O

when O
I O
start O
a O
new O

lol O
[SEP]
Like O
16-18 O
days O
I O
think. O
She O
said O
could O
be O
a O

of O
very O
early O
loss O
(I’m O
not O
as O
sure O
since O
I’ve O
been O
taking O

tho?). O
She O
said O
it O
should O
be O
14 O
days O
between O
the O
positive O
OPK O

the O
new O

[SEP]

Feeling O
cautiously O
optimistic. O
I’m O
sure O
my O
mind O
will O
spiral O
soon O
enough O
though. O
I O
was O
frustrated O
and O
down O
cause O
I O
thought O
provera O
didn’t O
even O
work O
to O
give O
me O
a O
period O
to O
start O
this O
cycle. O
Never O
been O
so O
happy O
to O
see O
my O
period. O
Just O
want O
to O
get O
things O
started O
really O
- O
sick O
of O
not O
even O
ovulating O
and O
being O
able O
to O
try O
[SEP]
i’m O
with O
you O
on O
this! O
i O
feel O
like O
i O
haven’t O
even O
had O
a O
shot O
at O
trying O
yet. O
but O
i’m O
also O
worried O
about O
all O
the O
stress O
of O
then O
‘actually’ O
ttc. O
i O
think O
i’ll O
be O
needing O
provera O
to O
start O
mine O
so O
i O
can O
then O
start O
the O
medicated O
cycle O
process. O
good O
luck O
to O
you! O
[SEP]
I O
know, O
it’s O
going O
to O
be O
a O
real O
lesson O
in O
patience. O
Waiting O
for O
(hopefully) O
ovulation, O
then O
the O
tww, O
then O
provera O
again, O
repeat. O
I’m O
hoping O
doing O
some O
yoga O
helps O
my O
stress. O
[SEP]
i O
agree! O
for O
sure O
have O
been O
trying O
to O
find O
what O
helps O
me O
manage O
stress O

My O
doctor O
told O
me O
it O
would O
just O
make O
me O
sleepy, O
but O
it O
made O
me O
suddenly O
gain O
weight O
and O
made O
my O
face O
puffy, O
as O
well O
as O
no O
help O
at O
all. O
Has O
anyone O
else O
had O
bad O
experience O
with O
it? O
[SEP]
It O
made O
me O
feel O
like O
I O
was O
drunk-drunk. O
Felt O
like O
I O
was O
moving O
around O
underwater O
and O
dizzy. O
I O
was O
prescribed O
it O
for O
nerve O
pain O
but O
only O
ever O
took O
it O
once. O
That O
was O
more O
than O
enough O
for O
me. O
I O
do O
know O
the O
other O
commenter O
is O
absolutely O
right O
about O
the O
withdrawals, O
I've O
seen O
many O
people O
go O
through O
it. O
I O
hope O
you O
find O
something O
that O
helps, O
but O
if O
it O
makes O
you O
feel O
weird O
and O
makes O
your O
face O
swell O
this O
probably O
isn't O
it. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
don't O
like O
it O
wean O
off O
as O
soon O
as O
possible. O
It's O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O
withdrawal O
I've O
ever O
gone O
through. O
Worse O
than O
benzos O
withdrawal. O
I O
was O
on O
900mg O
3x O
day O
for O
about O
six O
months. O
Near O
the O
end O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
losing O
my O
mind. O
The O
brain O
fog O
was O
so O
intense O
and O
my O
vision O
was O
awful. O
[SEP]
100 O
mg O
2x O
day O
chilled O
me O
out O
and O
helped O
some O
with O
blurry O
vision. O
200 O
mg O
2x O
day O
knocked O
me O
out O
with O
exhaustion. O
I O
gained O
~5 O
lbs O
in O
the O
3 O
months O
I O
was O
on O
gaba, O
and O
my O
face O
was O
puffy O
as O
well. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
because O
it O
made O
my O
tits O
hurt O
so O
fucking O
bad O
hahaha. O
Looked O
it O
up O
and O
in O
like O
1% O
of O
people O
it O
causes O
severe O
breast O
pain. O
Of O
course O
I O
was O
in O
the O
1%. O
Overall, O
even O
if O
it O
only O
helped O
my O
auras O
a O
little, O
I O
loved O
gaba O
for O
my O
anxiety. O
[SEP]
Those O
are O
known O
side O
effects. O
[SEP]
They O
gave O
me O
300 O
mg O
and O
it O
knocked O
me O
out. O
Then, O
100 O
mg O
which O
didn’t O
do O
anything. O
[SEP]
Omg O
is O
that O
why O
my O
face O
is O
puffy? O
Did O
it O
go O
away O
for O
y'all? O
[SEP]
I'm O
on O
gaba... O
Made O
me O
"stupid" O
in O
the O
begining. O
But O
your O
body O
adjusts. O
Weight O
gain O
can O
be O
a O
side O
effect. O
Not O
sure O
about O
the O
puffy O
face O
tho. O
Give O
Dr O
a O
call O
maybe. O
The O
withdrawals O
from O
it O
aren't O
fun... O
I've O
done O
it O
twice O
.. O
but O
it's O
better O
than O
say O
Lyrica. O
If O
you O
can O
try O
to O
give O
the O
med O
a O
chance O
otherwise O
move O
onto O
the O
next O
option. O
[SEP]
Yup, O
crap O
medicine O
for O
migraine. O
A O
GP O
put O
me O
on O
it O
for O
a O
while O
until O
I O
complained O
it O
did O
not O
help O
and O
made O
me O
feel O
awful. O
That O
and O
Topamax O
should O
not O
be O
prescribed O
for O
migraine, O
ever, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
but O
what O
do O
I O
know O
:/ O
[SEP]
Exactly O
what O
happened O
to O
me. O
Took O
it O
once O
and O
never O
again. O
Dr O
listed O
it O
as O
one O
of O
my O
allergies O
[SEP]
Ooh O
that O
might O
be O
why O
my O
tits O
hurt O
too O
lol O
[SEP]
That's O
interesting O
but O
makes O
sense. O
I O
have O
known O
a O
few O
people O
over O
the O
years O
that O
took O
it O
for O
fun, O
which O
I O
think O
is O
crazy O
on O
many O
levels. O
I O
never O
thought O
about O
it O
being O
an O
allergy. O
[SEP]
Basically O
just O
means O
they O
won’t O
ever O
prescribe O
it O
again O
and O
it O
will O
alert O
them O
in O
the O
system O

[SEP]
The O
first O
step O
is O
to O
have O
the O
pet O
dog O
you're O
wanting O
to O
train O
evaluated O
by O
a O
canine O
behavioralist O
or O
a O
professional O
trainer O
who's O
experienced O
in O
service O
dog O
training O
to O
see O
if O
they O
have O
potential O
as O
a O
candidate. O
It O
is O
much O
more O
likely O
for O
a O
dog O
to O
not O
have O
the O
right O
temperament O
for O
service O
work O
than O
it O
is O
for O
them O
to O
be O
suited O
for O
it, O
and O
because O
training O
is O
so O
incredibly O
expensive O
and O
takes O
so O
long O
(usually O
around O
2 O
years), O
you O
don't O
want O
to O
be O
starting O
out O
with O
a O
prospect O
that O
has O
no O
chance O
of O
succeeding. O
That's O
why O
it's O
important O
to O
get O
an O
evaluation O
first, O
before O
you O
start O
investing O
time O
and O
money O
into O
training. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
this O
current O
dog O
is O
a O
suitable O
prospect, O
the O
next O
step O
would O
be O
to O
get O
set O
up O
with O
a O
trainer O
who O
can O
help O
you O
through O
the O
process. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
this O
current O
dog O
is O
not O
a O
suitable O
prospect, O
whether O
that's O
because O
of O
temperament, O
behavioral O
habits, O
age, O
etc, O
the O
next O
step O
would O
be O
to O
acquire O
a O
new O
prospect O
and O
to O
potentially O
figure O
out O
a O
rehoming O
option O
for O
your O
current O
dog O
if O
owning O
two O
dogs O
at O
once O
isn't O
possible O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Something O
else O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
is O
that O
if O
you're O
looking O
for O
a O
dog O
to O
be O
a O
cardiac O
alert O
service O
dog, O
your O
best O
bet O
is O
to O
get O
a O
service O
dog O
from O
a O
program O
as O
opposed O
to O
owner O
training O
one. O
Cardiac O
alerts O
are O
currently O
not O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
type O
of O
alert O
that O
can O
be O
trained O
and O
instead O
require O
a O
natural O
ability O
from O
the O
dog. O
If O
cardiac O
alert O
is O
a O
task O
that O
you O
need O
a O
service O
dog O
to O
perform, O
getting O
a O
program O
dog O
is O
a O
much O
safer O
bet O
because O
then O
you O
know O
that O
dog O
will O
be O
able O
to O
do O
that O
task O
as O
opposed O
to O
rolling O
the O
dice O
and O
hoping O
the O
dog O
you O
attempt O
to O
owner O
train O
ends O
up O
able O
to O
do O
it. O
[SEP]
Well, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
this: O
it's O
allowed. O
There's O
no O
rule O
about O
who O
can O
and O
can't O
train O
a O
service O
animal, O
no O
certifications O
or O
licenses O
involved. O
And, O
there's O
no O
tests O
or O
anything O
for O
an O
animal O
you've O
trained O
to O
count. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
However, O
consider O
your O
position: O
you're O
asking O
Reddit O
how O
to O
train O
a O
dog O
to O
do O
something O
with O
your O
life O
in O
the O
balance. O
That O
screams O
"bad O
idea." O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
want O
to O
do O
this, O
first O
you O
have O
to O
train O
yourself O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
train O
dogs, O
and O
familiarize O
yourself O
with O
the O
process O
of O
training O
a O
service O
animal, O
and O
then O
re-visit O
this. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Until O
then, O
I'd O
suggest O
a O
medical O
alert O
system O
with O
fall O
detection O
as O
a O
stopgap O
[SEP]
I O
have O
experience O
with O
service O
dogs O
and O
"service O
dog O
trainers." O
The O
rules O
regarding O
service O
dogs O
are O
extremely O
flexible O
(too O
much O
so; O
bad O
people O
often O
take O
advantage O
of O
them) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
advice O
based O
on O
my O
experience: O
work O
with O
a O
dog O
that O
has O
a O
very O
good O
bond O
with O
you. O
The O
closer O
you O
are O
to O
him/her, O
the O
more O
likely O
that O
he/she O
will O
be O
in-tune O
with O
your O
body O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
don't O
have O
to O
formally O
train O
a O
dog O
for O
him/her O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
your O
body. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you're O
in O
an O
emergency O
state- O
that O
dog O
will O
*take O
care O
of O
you,* O
instinctively O
[SEP]
While O
training O
with O
a O
professional O
trainer O
isn’t O
required, O
you O
do O
still O
have O
to O
train O
a O
dog O
to O
do O
tasks. O
The O
vast O
majority O
of O
dogs O
aren’t O
just O
going O
to O
instinctively O
do O
task O
work O
simply O
because O
they O
have O
a O
bond O
with O
their O
owner O
like O
your O
saying O
they O
will. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
even O
if O
a O
dog O
does O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
natural O
alert O
or O
response, O
it O
doesn’t O
legally O
count O
as O
a O
task O
unless O
that O
natural O
alert/response O
is O
then O
shaped O
and O
reinforced O
as O
the O
ADA O
specifically O
states O
it O

- O
this O
particular O

mentioned O
that O

pass O
out. O
Not O
every O

would O
respond O
well O
to O
task O

any O

the O
sight O
of O
its O
owner O

out O

ground O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
guess O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
think O
more O
flexibly O
like O
"how O
can O
a O
person O
own O
a O
dog O
that O
can O
help O
save O
their O
life O
- O
without O
having O
to O
'train O
it' O
according O
to O

standards" O
[SEP]
No O
actually O
the O
majority O
of O
dogs O
won’t O
do O
that O
either. O
They O
may O
be O
slightly O
concerned O
or O
scared O
at O
first O
and O
then O
ignore/move O
away O
from O
their O
owner O
or O
even O
attempt O
to O
initiate O
play, O
but O
barking O
isn’t O
something O
a O
lot O
dogs O
will O
do O
in O
that O
situation. O
Especially O
not O
with O
the O
actual O
purpose O
of O
getting O
attention. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
type O
of O
thing O
must O
either O
be O
shaped O
or O
trained. O
And O
OP O
was O
specifically O
asking O
about O
having O
their O
pet O
dog O
become O
a O
service O
dog, O
which O
would O
need O
to O
meet O
the O
ADA O
definition O
and O
requirements O
to O
be O
a O
service O
dog. O
If O
it O
isn’t O
trained O
to O
that O
then O
it O
isn’t O
a O
service O
dog. O
[SEP]
Ugh O
whatever O
I O
still O

viewpoint O
based O
on O
my O
experience O

you O
have O
yours. O

a O
good O
one O
[SEP]
Literally O
- O
tasks O
must O
be O
trained O
in O
order O

count. O
Full O
stop. O
A O

and O
'natural O
reactions' O
do O
not O

the O

definition O
of O
a O

[SEP]
I O
"know* O
the O
tasks O
are O
required O
so O
a O
dog O
can O
legally O
be O
considered O
a O
service O
animal O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
in O
my O
experience, O
dog O
trainers O
often O
don't O
understand O
the O
disabled O
person's O
needs O
(and O
therefore O
they O
don't O
understand O
the O
tasks O
that O
they O
need O
to O
train O
the O
dog) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Personally, O
I O
don't O
think O
we O
need O
to O
train O
complicated O
tasks O
because O
when O
we O
develop O
strong O
bonds O
with O
animals, O
they O
can O
sense O

[SEP]
My B-Wife_GF
girlfriend I-Wife_GF
(22) B-Age
has O
been O
living O
with O
my O
family O
and O
I O
for O
almost O
a O
year. O
I O
am O
beginning O
to O
suspect O
she O
has O
a O
shopping O
addiction. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
currently O
has O
a O
couple O
thousand O
dollars O
in O
credit O
card O
debt O
and O
has O
taken O
out O
about O
$9k O
in O
several O
personal O
loans O
(with O
sky O
high O
interest, O
which O
she O
has O
used O
to O
pay O
off O
her O
past O
credit O
card O
debt). O
She O
also O
has O
been O
maxing O
out O
her O
student O
loans O
every O
semester O
to O
pay O
on O
her O
credit O
cards. O
(To O
make O
matters O
worse, O
she O
isn’t O
doing O
very O
well O
grade-wise O
but O
refuses O
to O
change O
her O
major O
to O
something O
more O
suited O
to O
her) O
She O
goes O
on O
large O
shopping O
sprees O
every O
couple O
weeks O
buying O
makeup, O
clothes O
and O
shoes. O
Our O
bedroom O
is O
overflowing O
with O
all O
her O
purchases, O
a O
lot O
of O
which O
she O
only O
wears O
a O
couple O
times. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
doesn’t O
have O
the O
greatest O
job O
either O
and O
only O
works O
part-time. O
She O
also O
bought O
a O
brand O
new O
vehicle O
for O
$25k O
on O
which O
the O
payment O
and O
insurance O
eats O
up O
over O
half O
of O
her O
income. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
love O
her O
but O
I’m O
finding O
it O
hard O
to O
wrap O
my O
head O
around O
what O
she O
does. O
I’m O
concerned O
that O
we O
will O
never O
be O
able O
to O
get O
a O
place O
of O
our O
own O
due O
to O
her O
debt-to-income O
ratio, O
let O
alone O
be O
able O
to O
one O
day O
buy O
a O
house. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Am O
I O
overreacting? O
If O
not, O
is O
there O
anything O
I O
can O
do O
to O
support O
her O
and O
help O
her O
see O
that O
this O
isn’t O
sustainable? O
[SEP]
You O
don't O
even O
have O
your O
own O
place, O
she's O
blowing O
money, O
and O
taking O
out O
loans O
with O
high O
interest??? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Ruh O
oh! O
You O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
her O
and O
set O
your O
priorities...if O
you O
live O
with O
family O
you O
do O
everything O
you O
can O
to O
be O
independent O
and O
I've O
been O
there. O
I O
don't O
like O
having O
to O
rely O
on O
anyone O
else, O
ever. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also, O
don't O
do O
anything O
stupid O
before O
you O
get O
this O
sorted. O
If O
she's O
not O
willing O
to O
adapt O
I O
guess O
is O
the O
word O
I'll O
use O
this O
may O
be O
a O
problem O
you O
have O
to O
live O
with O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life, O
unless O
divorce. O
[SEP]
Certainly O
tell O
her O
how O
this O
is O
affecting O
you. O
Sometimes O
people O
don't O
realize O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
until O
they O
are O
told. O
See O
if O
you O
can O
help O
her O
come O
up O
with O
a O
plan O
to O
get O
back O
on O
track O
and O
get O
to O
a O
better O
financial O
state. O
Being O
in O
college O
is O
hard, O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
she O
may O
not O
have O
developed O
the O
skills O
to O
manage O
money O
prior O
to O
college. O
A O
lot O
of O
people O
(including O
myself) O
have O
been O
there. O
Try O
not O
to O
demean O
her O
or O
talk O
down O
to O
her O
-- O
the O
world O
is O
set O
up O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
designed O
to O
make O
people O
like O
her O
continue O
what O
she O
is O
doing, O
in O
order O
to O
maximize O
profit O
off O
of O
her. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Remember O
that O
it O
is O
a O
gradual O
process O
-- O
you O
won't O
see O
progress O
overnight. O
She O
might O
have O
to O
take O
the O
time O
to O
see O
a O
therapist, O
if O
there O
is O
something O
that O
she O
is O
trying O
to O
compensate O
for. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
remember O
first O
and O
foremost, O
that O
she O
has O
to O
be O
willing O
to O
help O
herself. O
If O
you O
express O
how O
you O
feel O
and O
she O
doesn't O
seem O
to O
take O
it O
seriously, O
use O
that O
information O
for O
your O
next O
move. O
[SEP]
All O
good O
advice O
here, O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
add O
when O
you O
do O
approach O
her O
don’t O
do O
so O
from O
an O
accusatory O
place. O
It O
sounds O
like O
she’s O
dealing O
with O
a O
lot O
mentally O
(addiction O
is O
all O
about O
filling O
a O
void), O
and O
she O
may O
see O
it O
as O
an O
attack O
and O
crawl O
deeper O
into O
the O
hole. O
Be O
firm O
but O
gentle, O
and O
show O
her O
how O
you O
can O
help O
her O
too O
[SEP]
If O
she O
has O
a O
shopping O
addiction, O
she O
may O
need O
therapy O
to O
address O
the O
issues, O
as O
for O
some O
they O
get O
a O
high O
from O
shopping, O
or O
it O
helps O
ease O
stress. O
On O
top O
of O
that O
she O
is O
young, O
and O
might O
not O
have O
received O
proper O
financial O
guidance O
earlier O
on O
in O
her O
life. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Your O
concerns O
are O
valid O
and O
I O
suggest O
you O
present O
them O
to O
her O
in O
the O
kindest O
way O
possible, O
that O
you O
are O
worried O
for O
her O
and O
your O
future O
together. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Even O
too, O
what O
is O
her O
social O
media O
usage O
like? O
Is O
she O
being O
easily O
swayed O
by O
influencers? O
[SEP]
If O
she's O
in O

please O
see O
if O
there O
are O

Group O
Therapy O
for O
large O
groups? O
[SEP]
Hi O
everyone! O
Long O
time O
lurker, O
first O
time O
poster! O
I'm O
seeking O
some O
advice. O
I'm O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
re-entry O
program O
I O
work O
for. O
Our O
clients O
are O
mostly O
voluntary O
(I'd O
say O
95%). O
Twice B-Occupation
a I-Occupation
week, I-Occupation
I I-Occupation
co-facilitate I-Occupation
group I-Occupation
therapy I-Occupation
for I-Occupation
all I-Occupation
of I-Occupation
our I-Occupation
clients. I-Occupation
Basically, O
there O
are O
roughly O
30 O
to O
45 O
clients O
in O
a O
large O
room. O
For O
a O
variety O
of O
reasons O
that O
I O
won't O
get O
into O
on O
this O
post O
(trying O
to O
remain O
as O
anonymous O
as O
possible), O
we O
can't O
split O
the O
large O
group O
up O
into O
smaller O
groups. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Some O
clients O
participate O
and O
are O
supportive O
of O
others O
as O
they O
share, O
but O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
group O
are O
doing O
their O
own O
thing. O
Some O
of O
them O
sleep, O
some O
are O
on O
their O
phones, O
some O
are O
having O
sidebar O
conversations O
unrelated O
to O
the O
group O
topics, O
etc. O
We've O
tried O
collaborating O
with O
clients O
to O
create O
group O
norms, O
and O
we've O
tried O
using O
topic O
suggestions O
from O
our O
clients O
in O
hopes O
that O
it'll O
appeal O
to O
the O
group's O
interests. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Although O
I'm O
not O
a O
huge O
fan O
of O
the O
sleepers, O
it's O
the O
disruptive O
behaviors O
that O
bug O
me. O
I O
certainly O
don't O
want O
to O
force O
anyone O
to O
engage O
in O
therapy O
if O
they O
dont O
want O
to, O
but O
at O
the O
very O
least O
I'd O
like O
the O
clients O
that O
don't O
want O
to O
share O
to O
at O
least O
be O
quiet O
and/or O
observant. O
I've O
had O
clients O
come O
up O
to O
me O
after O
group O
and O
express O
their O
frustrations, O
which O
I O
certainly O
understand. O
I O
feel O
responsible O
because O
I've O
been O
unsuccessful O
at O
keeping O
the O
group O
from O
getting O
rowdy. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
here O
are O
my O
questions: O
[SEP]
1) O
has O
anyone O
here O
ever O
facilitated O
group O
therapy O
for O
30+ O
people O
with O
success? O
[SEP]
2) O
if O
you O
were O
successful, O
what O
did O
you O
do O
to O
make O
it O
work? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
Any O
suggestions O
are O
greatly O
appreciated. O

AITA O
for O
moving O
my O
TV O
back O
into O
my O
room O
after O
my O
roommates O
kept O
leaving O
the O
door O
unlocked? O
[SEP]
So O
I O
(19f) B-Age_Gender
live O
in O
a O
small O
apartment O
complex. O
My O
roommates O
(m&amp;f) O
have O
a O
habit O
of O
leaving O
the O
front O
door O
of O
our O
apartment O
unlocked O
and O
unattended. O
I've O
mentioned O
many O
times O
it O
makes O
me O
uncomfortable O
unless O
someone O
is O
in O
the O
common O
area O
hanging O
out O
or O
something. O
If O
they're O
in O
the O
common O
area, O
I O
don't O
care. O
[SEP]
My O
TV O
is O
out O
there O
for O
everyone O
to O
use. O
But O
with O
the O
door O
being O
unlocked, O
I B-Finance
have I-Finance
felt I-Finance
unsafe I-Finance
with I-Finance
it I-Finance
since I-Finance
I I-Finance
can't I-Finance
afford I-Finance
to I-Finance
replace I-Finance
it. I-Finance
The O
door O
being O
unlocked O
has O
happened O
so O
many O
times, O
and O
I O
finally O
told O
them O
that O
if O
it O
keeps O
happening, O
I'm O
going O
to O
have O
to O
move O
my O
TV O
into O
my O
room O
to O
have O
my O
own O
peace O
of O
mind. O
[SEP]
Since O
I O
told O
them O
that, O
it O
happened O
a O
good O
couple O
more O
times O
and O
I O
kept O
thinking O
to O
myself O
"you O
know, O
it's O
daytime, O
they're O
getting O
used O
to O
it, O
one O
more O
chance," O
and O
I'd O
just O
locked O
the O
door O
and O
carry O
on. O
[SEP]
The O
issue O
came O
when O
last O
night, O
everyone O
was O
in O
there O
rooms, O
I O
couldn't O
sleep. O
I O
got O
up O
around O
4am O
to O
go O
get O
water. O
I O
walk O
into O
the O
living O
room O
(no O
one O
in O
it), O
and O
the O
door O
is O
unlocked. O
It O
was O
4am. O
Way O
different O
then O
daytime. O
And O
that O
was O
my O
last O
straw. O
I O
immediately O
moved O
the O
TV O
into O
my O
room O
and O
didn't O
say O
anything. O
[SEP]
When O
asked O
the O
next O
day, O
I O
said O
"oh O
the O
door O
was O
unlocked O
at O
4am O
and O
no O
one O
was O
in O
here, O
so O
I O
felt O
safer O
with O
it O
in O
my O
room O
from O
now O
on." O
And O
there O
was O
some O
arguing O
saying O
it O
wasn't O
when O
I O
know O
it O
was, O
because O
I O
locked O
it O
afterwards, O
and O
then O
silent O
treatment. O
[SEP]
And O
I O
feel O
guilty O
because O
I O
don't O
want O
them O
to O
hate O
me, O
but O
I O
couldn't O
keep O
having O
my O
boundaries O
disrespected, O
as O
I've O
respected O
all O
of O
their's, O
and O
I O
don't O
feel O
safe O
having O
it O
at O
risk O
anymore. O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
was O
my O
right, O
and O
it's O
not O
even O
to O
punish O
anyone, O
it's O
just O
to O
protect O
my O
thing O
that O
I O
worked O
hard O
to O
purchase. O
[SEP]
AITA O
for O
moving O
it O
in O
my O
room? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Update: O
Thank O
you O
to O
everyone O
who O
commented. O
It O
made O
me O
feel O
so O
much O
better. O
[SEP]
(1) O
I O
am O
in O
a O
year O
long O
lease O
with O
about O
10 O
more O
months O
to O
go, O
so O
moving O
out O
isn't O
an O
option. O
[SEP]
(2) O
I O
lock O
my O
bedroom O
door O
constantly. O
Even O
right O
now O
as O
I'm O
in O
it. O
It O
is O
locked. O
And O
I've O
finally O
set O
up O
a O
camera O
in O
my O
room O
for O
when O
I O
leave. O
[SEP]
(3) O
I'm O
glad O
I'm O
not O
the O
bad O
roommate O
here. O
Im O
being O
made O
to O
feel O
like O
I O
am, O
which O
sucks. O
I've O
been O
told O
by O
a O
friend O
that O
I O
should O
try O
to O
"keep O
the O
peace" O
and O
"be O
friends" O
because O
I O
have O
to O
live O
with O
them, O
but O
tbh, O
(1) O
I've O
never O
blamed O
them. O
I O
gave O
many O
warnings O
and O
stated O
that O
it O
had O
everything O
to O
do O
with O
ME O
being O
anxious O
about O
the O
door O
being O
unlocked. O
And O
(2) O
if O
someone O
gets O
this O
mad/rude O
over O
someone O
setting O
a O
simple O
boundary, O
then O
why O
would O
I O
want O
them O
as O
a O
friend. O
As O
a O
roommate O
friendship O
isn't O
my O
priority; O
respect O
for O
each O
other O
(and O
each O
other's O
boundaries) O
is O
most O
important. O
(Also, O
this O
isn't O
the O
first O
instance O
of O
me O
setting O
a O
boundary O
and O
being O
treated O
differently O
after, O
so O
I O
started O
to O
think O
I O
was O
the O
problem). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Anyway, O
thank O
you O
guys O
so O
much. O
I'm O
content O
in O
my O
decision, O
and O
I'm O
going O
to O
enjoy O
my O
bedroom O
TV O
(: O

[SEP]
Used O
to O
live O
in O
a O
situation O
like O
that O
except O
my O
roommates O
at O
the O
time O
kept O
inviting O
a O
ton O
of O
strangers O
over O
without O
anyone O
else O
home. O
We O
had O
some O
expensive O
equipment O
in O
there O
and O
like O
OP, O
couldn't O
afford O
to O
replace O
it. O
Got O
to O
the O
point O
we O
started O
asking O
for O
spare O
keys O
back O
and O
only O
those O
whose O
names O
were O
on O
the O
lease O
could O
hold O
a O
key. O

hopefully. O
I O
wish O
you O

Nta, O

I O
do O
recommend O
you O
do O
a O
window O

check O

So O
I O
(19f) B-Age_Gender
live O
in O
a O
small O
apartment O
complex. O
My O
roommates O
(m&f) B-Age
have O
a O
habit O
of O
leaving O
the O
front O
door O
of O
our O
apartment O
unlocked O
and O
unattended. O
I've O
mentioned O
many O
times O
it O
makes O
me O
uncomfortable O
unless O
someone O
is O
in O
the O
common O
area O
hanging O
out O
or O
something. O
If O
they're O
in O
the O
common O
area, O
I O
don't O
care. O
[SEP]
My O
TV O
is O
out O
there O
for O
everyone O
to O
use. O
But O
with O
the O
door O
being O
unlocked, O
I O
have O
felt O
unsafe O
with O
it O
since O
I O
can't O
afford O
to O
replace O
it. O
The O
door O
being O
unlocked O
has O
happened O
so O
many O
times, O
and O
I O
finally O
told O
them O
that O
if O
it O
keeps O
happening, O
I'm O
going O
to O
have O
to O
move O
my O
TV O
into O
my O
room O
to O
have O
my O
own O
peace O
of O
mind. O
[SEP]
Since O
I O
told O
them O
that, O
it O
happened O
a O
good O
couple O
more O
times O
and O
I O
kept O
thinking O
to O
myself O
"you O
know, O
it's O
daytime, O
they're O
getting O
used O
to O
it, O
one O
more O
chance," O
and O
I'd O
just O
locked O
the O
door O
and O
carry O
on. O
[SEP]
The O
issue O
came O
when O
last O
night, O
everyone O
was O
in O
there O
rooms, O
I O
couldn't O
sleep. O
I O
got O
up O
around O
4am O
to O
go O
get O
water. O
I O
walk O
into O
the O
living O
room O
(no O
one O
in O
it), O
and O
the O
door O
is O
unlocked. O
It O
was O
4am. O
Way O
different O
then O
daytime. O
And O
that O
was O
my O
last O
straw. O
I O
immediately O
moved O
the O
TV O
into O
my O
room O
and O
didn't O
say O
anything. O
[SEP]
When O
asked O
the O
next O
day, O
I O
said O
"oh O
the O
door O
was O
unlocked O
at O
4am O
and O
no O
one O
was O
in O
here, O
so O
I O
felt O
safer O
with O
it O
in O
my O
room O
from O
now O
on." O
And O
there O
was O
some O
arguing O
saying O
it O
wasn't O
when O
I O
know O
it O
was, O
because O
I O
locked O
it O
afterwards, O
and O
then O
silent O
treatment. O
[SEP]
And O
I O
feel O
guilty O
because O
I O
don't O
want O
them O
to O
hate O
me, O
but O
I O
couldn't O
keep O
having O
my O
boundaries O
disrespected, O
as O
I've O
respected O
all O
of O
their's, O
and O
I O
don't O
feel O
safe O
having O
it O
at O
risk O
anymore. O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
was O
my O
right, O
and O
it's O
not O
even O
to O
punish O
anyone, O
it's O
just O
to O
protect O
my O
thing O
that O
I O
worked O
hard O
to O
purchase. O

I’ve B-Occupation
been I-Occupation
writing I-Occupation

here I-Occupation
and I-Occupation
there I-Occupation
for I-Occupation
years I-Occupation
but I-Occupation
never I-Occupation
had I-Occupation
any I-Occupation
luck I-Occupation
selling I-Occupation
them. I-Occupation
So O
I O
decided O
to O
narrow O
my O
focus O
and O
write O
something O
that O
would O
be O
easier O
to O
film. O
No O
car O
chases O
or O
creature O
effects. O
Also O
I O
personally O
love O
high O
concept, O
cerebral O
ideas O
so O
I O
decided O
to O
write O
a O
High O
Concept O
Low O
Budget O
horror O
screenplay… O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
it O
worked! O
I O
sold O
it O
and O
it’s O
In O
post O
production O
now. O
I O
think O
I O
want O
to O
keep O
writing O
in O
this O
format O
and O
see O
if O
I O
can O
do O
it O
again. O
Kinda O
make O
it O
my O

[SEP]

I’m O
hoping O
to O
hear O
from O
other O

about O
if O
they O
tailor O
their O
writing O
to O
fit O
into O
a O
certain O
style O

if O
they O
hope O
to O
make O
a O

writing O
a O
screenplays O
of O
only O
types. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also O
any O
other O
writers O
who O
write O
similar O
screenplays, O
what O
have O

it O

I O
don't O
really O
do O
the O
Hollywood O
thing O
anymore. O
Did O
that O
back O
in O
the O
80s O
and O
90s. O
These O
days, O
at O
my O
age, O
I O
love O
writing O
simple, O
character-driven O
low O
budget O
movies O
for O
independent O
producers. O
The O
pay O
is O
not O
great, O
certainly O
not O
by O
Hollywood O
standards, O
but O
the O
movies O
get O
made. O
A O
movie O
I O
wrote O
last O
year O
is O
in O
post O
now. O
I O
can't O
wait O
to O
see O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Sounds O
like O
you O
got O
a O
good O
plan O
working O
for O
you. O
Wishing O
you O
continued O
success. O
[SEP]
That’s O
basically O
the O
Blumhouse O
model. O
Jason O
has O
wondered O
out O
loud O
why O
others O
aren’t O
adopting O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
also O
wrote O
a O
high O
concept, O
low O
budget O
banger O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
attracting O
a O
producer. O
And O
that O
script O
is O
out O
with O
an O
A-list O
production O
company O
off O
a O
cold O
query. O
[SEP]
Right O
now O
I’m O
working O
on O
a O
comedy O
pilot O
that, O
after O
looking O
at O
the O
pitch O
deck, O
said O
he O
“can’t O
think O
of O
a O
more O
complicated O
comedy” O
but O
that O
“the O
script O
could O
be O
great.” O
Another O
producer O
read O
the O
script O
and O
said O
it O
was O
“hilarious O
and O
like O
It’s O
Always O
Sunny O
meets O
Half O
Baked” O
so O
the O
complexity O
of O
it O
seems O
to O
range. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
writing O
something O
simple O
yet O
fucking O
bonkers O
is O
so O
fun O
and O
uninhabiting. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Congrats O
on O
selling O
the O
script! O
I O
can’t O
wait O
to O
see O
a O
post O
when O
it O
finally O
comes O
out! O

Think O
about O
the O

that O

figure O
out O

How O
long O
did O
it O
take O
to O
write O
the O
script? O
How O
much O
did O
you O
get O

for O

How O
many O
would O
you O
need O
to O
write O
in O

(and O

to O
quit O
your O

job? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Solid O
high-concept O
low-budget O
scripts O
are O
more O
difficult O
to O
write O
than O
if O
you O
had O
no O
budgetary O
restrictions. O
Ironically, O
the O
compensation O
for O
the O
added O
difficulty O
is O
diametrically O
lowered, O
since O
the O
film O
budget O
is O
limited. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I'm O
not O
saying O
don't O
do O
it O
again. O
We O
all O
need O
to O
have O
realistic O
producible O
work O
in O
our O
portfolio. O
But O
do O
not O
limit O

at O

I O
love O

low O

stuff. O
[SEP]

For O
me O
it O
was O
an O
obvious O
move. O
Would O
I O
give O
a O
first O
timer O
millions O
for O
anything? O
No. O
So O
if O
you O
write O
something O
people O
are O
will O
to O
risk O
some O
cash O
on O
(low O
budget), O
you O
have O
a O
better O
chance. O
[SEP]
Can O
I O
ask O
what O
you O
mean O
by O
high O
concept O
cerebral O
ideas O
because O
that O
sounds O
almost O
like O
an O
oxymoron O
to O
me. O
[SEP]
Did O
you O
still O
get O
a O
decent O
payday? O
I'm O
scared O
that O
if O
I'm O
*too* O
budget-friendly, O
I'll O
only O
harm O
my O
potential O
earnings. O
[SEP]
that's O
awesome O
congratulations!! O
[SEP]
[SEP]
did O
you O
have O
to O
change O
anything O
from O
the O

script? O
& O
also, O
could O
you O
had O
been O
part O

you O
requested O
possibly? O
given O
that O
it O
was O

A O

Unlike O
Hollywood O
where O
writer O
rates O
are O
dictated O
by O
the O
Writers O
Guild, O
low O

independent O

depend O

work O

what O
you O
can O
get. O
Five O
grand, O
ten O
grand, O
twenty O
grand. O
Whatever. O
It O
just O
depends. O
Sometimes O
you O
work O
cheap O
in O
the O
hopes O
the O

take O
off O

My B-Wife_GF
wife I-Wife_GF
works I-Wife_GF
in I-Wife_GF
a I-Wife_GF
local I-Wife_GF
elementary I-Wife_GF
school I-Wife_GF
and O
has O
worked O
with O
a O
boy O
for O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
who O
has O
been O
in O
the O
system O
since O
birth, O
in O
and O
out O
of O
foster O
homes, O
family O
homes O
etc..The O
kid O
has O
had O
no O
stable O
place O
to O
stay O
and O
lives O
out O
of O
a O
suitcase. O
After O
2 O
years O
of O
working O
with O
him O
daily, O
my B-Wife_GF
wife I-Wife_GF
asked I-Wife_GF
if I-Wife_GF
he I-Wife_GF
could I-Wife_GF
live I-Wife_GF
with I-Wife_GF
us, I-Wife_GF
she O
said O
he O
is O
a O
sweet O
kid O
who O
needs O
a O
stable, O
loving O
home O
and O
we O
can O
provide O
that. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
concern O
is O
that O
the O
kid O
has O
averaged O
6 O
homes O
a O
year O
and O
we O
don’t O
know O
why. O
My B-Wife_GF
wife I-Wife_GF
and I-Wife_GF
the I-Wife_GF
schools I-Wife_GF
have I-Wife_GF
seen I-Wife_GF
no I-Wife_GF
signs I-Wife_GF
of I-Wife_GF
anything I-Wife_GF
serious, I-Wife_GF
no O
violence O
or O
trauma, O
he O
is O
well O
adjusted, O
happy O
and O
gets O
along O
with O
everyone. O
Is O
this O
normal? O
Is O
30 O
plus O
homes O
unusual? O
Is O
the O
system O
that O
broken? O
Or O
should O
I O
be O
really O
wary? O
I O
have O
no O
context O
to O
help O
me O
understand O
this O
number O
of O
homes. O
[SEP]
I O
would O
expect O
him O
to O
show O
some O
challenges O
related O
to O
attachment O
and O
trust O
if O
he's O
been O
in O
that O
many O
times. O
It O
will O
take O
a O
long O
time O
for O
him O
to O
let O
his O
guard O
down. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
A O
home O
environment O
can O
be O
very O
challenging O
for O
some O
students; O
school O
is O
structured O
and O
predictable, O
and O
serious O
trauma O
very O
rarely O
happens O
in O
a O
school. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
fact O
that O
your O
wife O
already O
has O
a O
solid O
relationship O
with O
him O
should O
be O
a O
really O
big O
help. O
Many O
stories O
from O
foster O
care O
where O
children O
do O
well O
start O
this O
way. O
Of O
course, O
he O
has O
significant O
trauma O
and O
is O
likely O
not O
as O
"well-adjusted" O
under O
the O
surface O
as O
he O
seems. O
You O
may O
want O
to O
read O
about O
trauma; O
"What O
Happened O
to O
You" O
by O
Dr. O
Bruce O
Perry O
and O
Oprah O
is O
a O
fairly O
easy O
read O
and O
a O
great O
introduction. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
doesn't O
mean O
that O
you O
won't O
have O
a O
rewarding O
experience. O
[SEP]
The O
system O
is O
that O
broken. O
I O
have O
literal O
infants O
that O
average O
six O
homes. O
INFANTS. O
I B-Family
have I-Family
teens I-Family
who I-Family
have I-Family
had I-Family
hundreds I-Family
of I-Family
placements. I-Family
And O
kids O
who O
have O
no O
placement O
go O
into O
what O
is O
called O
temporary O
placements O
where O
they O
literally O
are O
moved O
every O
week O
if O
not O
every O
day O
- O
the O
commitments O
are O
only O
for O
a O
day O
at O
a O
time. O
Sounds O
like O
he O
has O
been O
in O
that O
a O
few O
times. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
All O
children O
in O
foster O
care O
have O
trauma O
behaviors, O
and O
every O
move O
worsens O
them. O
We O
recruit O
too O
many O
untrained O
foster O
families. O
A O
child O
being O
harmed O
is O
never O
the O
fault O
of O
the O
child. O
Foster O
care O
often O
harms O
the O
children O
more O
than O
the O
original O
bio O
family O
due O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
trauma O
and O
its O
affect O
on O
the O
brain. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
will O
be O
honest, O
the O
amount O
of O
homes O
is O
going O
to O
have O
caused O
a O
lot O
of O
pain O
and O
damage, O
but O
**it O
isn't O
his O
fault.** O
I'm O
sure O
many O
were O
also O
abusive O
emotionally O
(even O
if O
unintentional O
- O
many O
people O
use O
traditional O
parenting O
methods O
of O
punishment O
not O
understanding O
it O
is O
harmful O
and O
abusive O
to O
traumatized O
kids), O
just O
due O
to O
the O
statistical O
odds, O
and O
caused O
his O
pain O
to O
deepen. O
I O
could O
take O
a O
perfect O
super O
child, O
from O
the O
best O
family O
in O
the O
world, O
and O
if O
you O
put O
that O
child O
through O
what O
that O
foster O
child O
has O
been O
through, O
they O
would O
act O
the O
same O
way. O
Heck, O
if O
I O
took O
an O
adult, O
they O
would O
act O
the O
same O
way O
(if O
not O
worse). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
hard O
journey O
(but O
if O
you O
have O
the O
right O
mindset, O
amazing, O
because O
you're O
helping O
an O
abused O
child O
and O
growing O
as O
a O
person O
yourself O
to O
be O
more O
patient, O
loving, O
empathetic, O
and O
strong) O
and O
you're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
dedicate O
yourself O
to O
learning O
and O
studying O
trauma O
and O
parenting O
traumatized O
kids. O
As O
long O
as O
you O
take O
the O
time O
to O
really O
learn O
and O
research, O
it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
best O
things O
you O
have O
chosen O
to O
do O
in O
your O
life O
(although O
sometimes O
you O
may O
regret O
it O
and O
want O
to O
jump O
out O
the O
window O
- O
but O
that O
is O
just O
being O
a O
parent O
in O
general). O
The O
child O
you O
see O
in O
school O
is O
the O
child O
he O
is O
deep O
down, O
but O
there O
are O
going O
to O
be O
huge O
scary O
trauma O
behaviors O
that O
arise O
once O
he O
is O
placed O
in O
your O
home O
to O
test O
you O
and O
see O
if O
you O
will O
disrupt. O
These O
kids O
will O
do O
everything O
they O
can O
to O
try O
to O
push O
you O
away. O
If O
you O
prepare O
for O
it O
and O
dedicate O
yourself O
to O
**committing**, O
then O
you'll O
live O
and O
come O
out O
stronger O
for O
it, O
and O
it O
will O
save O
his O
literal O
physical O
and O
neurological O
development O
in O
ways O
that O
are O
profound. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
recommend O
reading O
some O
books. O
In O
fact, O
a O
lot O
of O
books. O
The O
more O
you O
read, O
the O
better O
off O
you'll O
be. O
There O
are O
also O
some O
great O
on O
demand O
DVDs O
by O
Karyn O
Purvis O
regarding O
TBRI. O
I O
find O
these O
to O
be O
incredible. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Be O
wary O
of O
Reddit O
and O
social O
media O
groups. O
Always O
remember O
that O
the O
type O
people O
who O
failed O
him O
initially O
are O
also O
members, O
and O
even O
though O
well-intended, O
do O
not O
have O
the O
skillset O
to O
heal O
but O
often O
end O
up O
profoundly O
breaking O
these O
kids. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Get O
therapy O
for O
yourself O
and O
for O
him O
right O
away. O
If O
you O
need O
a O
good O
virtual O
group O
with O
trainings, O
PM O
me. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
although O
I'm O
not O
too O
religious, O
God O
bless O
you O
for O
doing O
this O
for O
him. O
You O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
impact O
you O
can O
have. O
It O
is O
so O
profound. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
stepping O
up O
for O
this O
child. O
30 O
homes? O
That's O
atrocious O
and O
not O
normal. O
Definitely O
have O
a O
frank O
talk O
about O
this O
with O
the O
social O
worker. O
It O
may O
not O
be O
the O
child's O
fault O
at O
all O
but O
it's O
definitely O
something O
to O
carefully O
discuss. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you. O
I O
ordered O
the O
book. O
I O
know O
it O
will O
take O
time O
and O
gentle O
persistence O
to O
gain O
his O
trust, O
and O
I’m O
quiet O
and O
patient. O
It O
will O
come O
in O
time, O
I’m O
sure. O
It O
just O
has O
to O
be O
earned O
honestly. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you. O
I O
completely O
understand O
that O
the O
kid O
is O
blameless, O
and O
that O
a O
load O
of O
bad O
decisions O
by O
adults O
in O
his O
life O
have O
brought O
him O
here. O
I O
know O
we O
have O
a O
job O
ahead O
of O
us, O
but O
like O
anything O
worth O
doing, O
it’s O
worth O
doing O
it O
right. O
This O
isn’t O
about O
us, O
it’s O
about O
him. O

I O
love O
Dr. O

I O
would O
read O
Dr. O

books O
before O
reading, O
"The O
Body O
Keeps O
The O

which O
is O
also O
commonly O
recommended O
and O
is O
going O
to O
come O
up O
to O
you O
at O
some O
point. O
They're O
very O
similar O
books O
and O
the O
two O
authors O
worked O
in O
the O
same O
labs, O
but O
one O
is O
aimed O
at O
adults O
and O
the O
other O
is O
aimed O
at O

As O
long O
as O
you O
dedicate O
yourself O
to O
never O
giving O
up, O
then O
the O
battle O
is O
won. O
My O
advice O
too O
is O
to O
keep O
the O
bar O
extremely O
low. O
If O
he O
manages O
to O
walk O
in O
the O
house, O
consider O
that O
a O
win. O
If O
he O
says O
hello, O
act O
like O
it O
is O
a O
miracle O
that O
he O
has O
such O
social O
skills. O
If O
he O
knows O

potty O

You O

from I-Education
my I-Education

I've O

in O
this O
program O
and O
I've O
done O
well O
even O
when O

due O
to O
the O

[SEP]

My B-Relationship_Status

(30m) B-Age_Gender
currently O
lives O
6 O
hours O
away O
for O
his O
doctoral O
program O
that O
he's O
dreamed O
of O
ever O
since O
I O
met O
him O
11 O
years O
ago. O
He O
unfortunately O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
attend O
because O
he O
has O
final O
exams O
the O
next O
day. O
I O
completely O
understand O
and O
I O
don't O
want O
him O
to O
do O
poorly O
on O
his O
final O
exams O
especially O
since O
he O
expressed O
concern O
that O
he O
hasn't O
been O
performing O
to O
his O
standards O
and O
may O
risk O
some O
need O
for O
remediation. O
I O
truly O
do O
not O
want O
him O
to O
risk O
his O
performance O
for O
his O
exam O
to O
travel O
to O
me O
for O
graduation O
and O
so O
forth. O
We O
both O
discussed O
that O
it O
is O
in O
both O
of O
our O
interests O
that O
he O
stay O
at O
school O
to O
prepare O
for O
his O
exams. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
the O
days O
come O
closer O
and O
closer O
to O
graduation, O
I O
become O
more O
sad O
that O
he O
won't O
be O
there O
to O
share O
this O
monumental O
ceremony O
experience O
with O
me. O
I O
am O
saddened O
because O
he's O
been O
with O
me O
for O
the O
last O
11 O
years, O
proposed O
to O
me O
this O
year, O
and O
he's O
been O
there O
supporting O
me O
throughout O
my O
entire O
undergraduate O
and O
graduate O
career. O
I O
want O
to O
share O
this O
special O
moment O
with O
him O
and O
celebrate O
with O
him. O
I've O
done O
the O
same O
for O
him O
as O
he O
also O
started O
his O
doctoral O
program O
this O
year O
and O
supported O
him O
throughout. O
I'm O
extremely O
proud O
of O
him O
and O
want O
him O
to O
excel O
and O
exceed O
in O
his O
program. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He O
has O
expressed O
feeling O
guilty O
of O
not O
being O
able O
to O
make O
it. O
I've O
told O
him O
time O
and O
time O
again O
that O
though O
he O
may O
feel O
guilty, O
it's O
okay. O
Because O
even O
though O
I O
lie O
about O
being O
sad O
momentarily O
when O
I O
think O
about O
him O
not O
being O
there, O
I O
truthfully O
tell O
him O
that O
I O
am O
extremely O
happy O
he's O
in O
his O
dream O
program O
and O
that O
he O
will O
have O
the O
career O
he's O
been O
working O
so O
hard O
for O
for O
the O
past O
11 O
years. O
I O
truly O
don't O
want O
him O
to O
feel O
guilty O
because O
I O
sort O
of O
do O
think O
him O
not O
coming O
is O
an O
investment O
for O
his O
program O
to O
pass, O
not O
remediate, O
and O
get O
that O
degree. O
I O
was O
reminded O
throughout O
my O
master's O
program O
that O
committing O
to O
it O
and O
making O
sure O
I O
graduate O
costs O
us O
a O
short O
term O
sacrifice O
of O
not O
always O
being O
able O
to O
be O
there O
for O
your O
loved O
ones O
or O
for O
personal O
enjoyment, O
for O
long O
term O
payout O
(hopefully). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
do O
plan O
on O
spending O
much O
much O
more O
time O
with O
him O
after O
I O
graduate O
and O
travel O
with O
my O
family O
internationally O
for O
the O
holidays O
(he O
is O
not O
joining O
due O
to O
the O
14 O
hour O
flights O
to O
and O
from, O
16 O
hour O
time O
difference, O
and O
about O
only O
a O
1.5-2 O
week O
break). O
So O
the O
distance O
is O
not O
an O
issue, O
it's O
just O
that O
I'm O
sad O
he O
won't O
be O
at O
graduation. O
Plus, O
I O
will O
be O
his O
study O
buddy O
again O
once O
I'm O
back O
since O
I O
have O
to O
study O
for O
board O
exams. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
the O
sadness O
just O
revolves O
around O
wanting O
to O
have O
my O
person O
be O
there O
with O
me O
to O
see O
me O
graduate. O
To O
take O
pictures O
for O
memories O
that O
we O
both O
did O
this O
together, O
celebrate O
together O
with O
family O
afterwards O
at O
my O
favorite O
restaurant, O
and O
just O
have O
a O
final O
deep O
breath O
of O
relief O
with O
my O
fiance O
and O
family O
that O
I O
actually O
completed O
my O
program. O
I O
want O
to O
have O
every O
monumental O
accomplishments O
and O
experiences O
shared O
with O
him. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
wanted O
to O
get O
this O
off O
my O
chest O
because O
I O
sometimes O
feel O
like O
a O
burden O
when O
I O
have O
the O
need O
to O
cry O
or O
express O
my O
sadness O
when O
it O
comes O
around. O
Just O
needed O
to O
vent O
and O
express. O

who O
have O
accomplished O

nothing. O

him O
getting O
to O

We O

the O

suck O

GAH! O
We O
will O
definitely O
be O
fine O

be O
watching O
if O
he's O
not O
in O
the O

I'm O
so O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
about O
your O

My O

to O

to O
attend O

December O
8th O
and O
your O

service O
you O
will O
be O
attending. O
Most O
likely O
they O
will O
do O
nothing, O

if O
they O
do O
you O
have O
etablished O
evidence O
for O
a O

chance O

Well O
I O
work O
in O

any O

those O

I’m B-Occupation

working I-Occupation
usually I-Occupation
too. I-Occupation
Most O

work O
at O

the O

are O
usually O

I’ll O
definitely O
ask O
though O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
think O
there’s O
any O
past O
8pm O
at O
the O

around O
me O
but O
I O
could O
double O
check. O
[SEP]
No, O
you O
should O
definitely O
inform O
your O

that O
it O
is O
a O
religious O
holiday O
[SEP]
Usually O
people O
don’t O
switch O

I’ll O
definitely O
try. O
Worst O
comes O

can O
I O

[SEP]
Don’t O
quit. O
If O
they O
want O

fire O
you O

let O
them. O
[SEP]
That’s O
a O
terrible O
idea…and O
also O
illegal O
[SEP]
I O
mean O
i O
could O
but O
my O

isn’t O
Catholic O
and O
she O
wouldn’t O
be O
willing O
to O
call O
me O
out O
of O
school. O
[SEP]
So O
you O
can't O
get O
to O
a O
Mass O
during O
the O
day? O
I O
realize O
that O
you O
said O
you're O
a O
student. O
[SEP]
I O
assumed O
they O
had O
already O
done O
that. O
[SEP]
> O
can O
I O
actually O
hire O
a O
lawyer? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can...but O
you O
can O
likely O
kiss O
the O
job O
goodbye O
and O
it'll O
cost O
you O
a O
lot O
of O
money. O
[SEP]
Leaving O
school O
for O
a O

is O
illegal? O
I O
don't O

even O
if O

are, O
I O
don't O

that O
a O

can't O
pull O
a O

out O

Hell, O
we O
routinely O
pull O

out O

at O
a O
time O
to O
go O
deer O
hunting. O
[SEP]
I O
can’t O
unless O
I O
skipped O

[SEP]
It’s O
illegal O
for O
a O

to O
have O
a O
high O
school O
kid O
come O
to O
work O
during O
his O

time. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
OP O
is O
clearly O
some O
high O
schooler. O
[SEP]
Well O
it O
depends O
on O
what O
would O
be O
the O
worse O
consequences.... O
missing O
a O
class O
or O
two, O
or O
possibly O
losing O
your O
job. O
🤷🏼‍♂️ O
[SEP]
I O
didn’t O
suggest O
having O
anyone O
leave O
school O
to O
go O
to O
work. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
said, O
when O
I O
was O
a O
senior O
in O
highschool O
I O
went O
to O
school O
for O
half O
of O
a O
day O
and O
worked O
half O
a O

so O
it O
isn’t O
illegal O
here. O
I O
had O
all O
the O
credits O
I O
needed O
by O
then O
though. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
aren’t O
in O
school O
at O
the O
time O
then O
it’s O
legal, O
but O
an O
employer O
cannot O
be O
having O
student O
workers O
sipping O
to O
work. O
OP O
seems O
imply O
they O
are O
in O
class. O
[SEP]
Nobody O
suggested O
that O
the O
employer O
would O
be O
having O
the O

miss O
class O
to O
work. O
I O
suggested O
they O
miss O
class O
to O
attend O
Mass. O

Hi O
there, O
not O
sure O

me O

this O
but O
I’m O
a O
little O
worried O
about O
my O

for O
an O

In O
mid O
January O
I’m B-Location
flying I-Location
from I-Location

New I-Location

through I-Location
Montreal. I-Location
The O
first O
flight O
gets O
into O
YUL O
at O
around O
7:40am. O
It’s O
then O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
layover O
before O
the O
flight O
to O
New O
York. O
Am O
I O
going O
to O
be O
screwed O
for O
getting O
through O

I O
know O
technically O
the O
airline O
wouldn’t O
offer O
the O
trip O
if O
it O
wasn’t O
enough O
time O
but O
I O
haven’t O
flown O
internationally O
since O
long O
before O
COVID O
so O
I’m O
panicking O
a O
little. O
I’m O
not O
checking O
any O
bags O
which O
I O
think O
helps O
my O
case. O
I’m O
also O
travelling O
alone O
if O
that O
makes O
a O
difference. O
If O
anyone O
has O
any O
insight O
on O
whether O
I O
should O
look O
into O
changing O
my O
flight O
please O
let O
me O
know! O
[SEP]
There O
are O
flights O
from O
Montréal O
to O
NYC O
almost O
every O
hour O
in O
the O
morning. O
If O
you O
do O
miss O
the O
connection, O
AC O
will O
just O
put O
you O
in O
the O
next O
flight. O
The O
caveat O
is O
which O
NYC O
airport O
you O
will O
be O
put O
on O
to. O
[SEP]
It O
will O
be O
tight O
that O
time O
of O
the O
morning, O
but O
they O
pulled O
ppl O
from O
the O
connections O
line O
through O
customs O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
in O
a O
long O
line O
so O
you O
should O
be O
fine. O
Not O
having O
a O
checked O
bag O
will O
save O
you O
hours O
and O
hours O
if O
you O
were O
to O
misconnect. O
[SEP]
Should O
be O
fine. O
Last O
time O
I O
did O
transborder O
in O
YUL O
was O
in O
October O
and O
the O
luggage O
was O
the O
slow O
bit O
at O
US O
customs O
so O
if O
you O
can O
avoid O
checking O
a O
bag O
that O
will O
help. O
But O
as O
long O
as O
your O
departure O
is O
on O
time O
it O
should O
be O
fine. O
As O
someone O
else O
mentioned, O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
other O
daily O

so O
worst O
case O
is O
you O
get O

no O
one O
ever O
deserves O
this, O
especially O
women O
who O
have O
to O
sacrifice O
their O
boobs. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
amazed O
by O
those O
who O
are O
able O
to O
make O
the O
hard O
decisions O
(though O
what O
choice O
do O
we O
have?). O
I O
can’t O
imagine O
how O
painful O
and O
uncomfortable O
reconstruction O
will O
be. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Though O
there O
is O
nothing O
I O
can O
do O
for O
you, O
I’ll O
be O
thinking O
of O
you, O
my O
fellow O
sister. O
If O
this O
helps O
at O
all, O
know O
that O
there O
are O
so O
many O
women O
in O
the O
same O
boat O
as O
you, O
and O
you’re O
not O
alone. O
Rant O
and O
vent O
here O
all O
you O
want O
and O
we O
will O
hear O
your O
voice. O
The O
world O
is O
cruel O
enough O
as O
it O
is, O
but O
this O
is O
your O
safe O
place. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Wishing O
you O
a O
speedy O
recovery! O
[SEP]
I’m O
so O
sorry O
you O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
this. O
Ask O
your O
team O
if O
you’re O
a O
candidate O
for O
a O
nipple O
sparing O
mastectomy. O
My O
nipples O
lost O
all O
sensation O
which O
is O
hard O
to O
adjust O
to, O
but O
aesthetically O
they O
look O
fine. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
One O
thing O
to O
consider O
is O
that O
implants O
don’t O
have O
to O
be O
permanent. O
I O
wasn’t O
a O
candidate O
for O
a O
tissue O
flap O
surgery, O
but O
my O
plastic O
surgeon O
said O
I O
can O
get O
implants O
right O
now O
and O
then O
get O
them O
removed O
and O
do O
a O
flap O
procedure O
in O
the O
future. O
It O
will O
end O
up O
being O
extra O
surgeries O
down O
the O
line, O
but O
it O
might O
be O
worth O
it O
if O
you O
want O
to O
get O
it O
over O
with O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also, O
I O
can O
only O
have O
sex O
with O
a O
bra O
on O
now. O
It’s O
been O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
and O
it’s O
still O
super O
emotional O
for O
me O
to O
take O
my O
bra O
off O
around O
someone. O
Not O
one O
guy O
has O
ever O
complained O
about O
me O
wearing O
a O
bra O
during O
sex. O
They’re O
just O
excited O
to O
be O
having O
sex! O

I O

an O

hopefully O

up O
my O

after O

Asking O
with O
the O
nipple-sparing O
surgeries, O
you O
also O
have O
the O
option O
of O
tattooing O
nipples O
on O
your O
breasts O
if O
you O
choose, O
along O
with O
nipple O
reconstruction O
surgery. O
I O
was O
offered O
the O
nipple O
reconstruction O
as O
part O
of O
the O
DIEP O
recommendation O
but O
eagerly O
opted O
to O
pass. O
I O
spent O
my O
entire O
life O
trying O
to O
hide O
my O
very O
temperature O
responsive O
nipples O
and O
was O
happy O
to O
never O
have O
to O
think O
about O
that O
again. O
I O
haven't O
yet O
decided O
what O
to O
do O
about O
nipples, O
I'm O
going O
the O
tattoo O
route O
but O
haven't O
decided O
if O
I'm O
going O
to O
get O
a O
regular O
nipple O
or O
go O
for O
something O
more O
creative. O
There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
beautiful O
images O
if O
you O
search O
for O
mastectomy O
tattoos. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I'm O
sorry O
that O
you're O
facing O
such O
a O
hard O
situation. O
It O
sucks. O
As O
others O
have O
said, O
you O
are O
not O
your O
boobs, O
you O
are O
a O
person O
with O
boobs O
that O
needs O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
before O
they O
kill O
you. O
It O
feels O
like O
a O
betrayal, O
but O
it O
gets O
easier O
over O
time. O
You O
are O
taking O
control O
of O
your O
life O
and O
that O
matters O
more O
than O
any O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
it. O

This O
is O
tough O
no O
way O
around O
it O
so O
you O
have O
to O
go O
thru O
it. O
But O
for O
me O
I O
was O
going O
to O
be O
in O
charge. O
I O
wasn’t O
going O
to O
be O
pushed, O
even O
though O
the O
doctors O
tried. O
I O
prayed O
about O
what O
to O
do O
and O
decided O
it O
was O
my O
body O
and O
I O
was O
going O
to O
work O
thru O
this. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
why O
they O
remove O
other O
female O
organs. O
There O
was O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
me O
but O
one O
breast O
and O
the O
cancer O
had O
gone O
to O
stage O
four O
and O
was O
in O
my O
back, O
abdomen, O
liver O
and O
right O
knee. O

I O
know O
that O
it O
is O

panic O
at O
this O
being O
in O
your O
body O
but O
I O
pray O
that O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
stop O
and O
work O
thru O
this. O
I O
changed O
my O
diet, O
took O
one O
small O
chemo O
pill O
(doctor O
insisted O
that O
if O
she O
was O
going O
to O
treat O
me O
and O
help O
me O
to O
monitor O
my O
progress). O
It O
has O
been O
five O
years. O
I O
had O
four O
years O
of O
progress O
and O
the O
fifth O
year O
my O
immune O
system O
was O
weakened O
and O
the O
cancer O
went O
up O
on O
me. O
But O
I O
focused O
on O
being O
grateful, O
eating O
and O
exercising O
and O
low O
stress, O
as O
much O
as O
possible. O
I O
take O
a O
handful O
of O
supplements O
each O
day O
to O
keep O
my O
body O
healthy. O

to O
find O
the O

you. O
God O

you O
dear O
one. O
One O
thing O
that O
worked O
for O
me O
and O
I O
have O
seen O
work O
for O
others O
was O
that O
I O
didn’t O
let O
cancer O
define O
me. O
I O
am O
a O
person O
first, O
with O
a O
life O
and O
I O
refused O
to O
let O
the O
cancer O
overtake O
me. O
I O
am O
thankful O
for O
each O
day. O
I O
am O
thankful O
for O
the O
healing. O
I O
accept O
each O
day O
as O
valuable O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
what O
each O
day O
offers O
and O
will O
not O
live O
with O
the O
regret O
of O
turning O
myself O
over O
to O
someone O
else O
to O
make O
my O

I O
live O
each O

Hi. O
I O
had O
the O
same O
thing O
and O
opted O
for O
DCIS O
instead O
of O
implants. O
Just O
a O
thought O
[SEP]
I O
also O
had O
a O
nipple O
and O
skin O
sparing O
mastectomy. O
I'm O
shocked O
how O
normal O
my O
reconstructed O
breasts O
look. O
The O
only O
incision O
is O
along O
the O
breast O
crease. O
[SEP]
I O
will O
ask. O
I O
know O
my O
oncologist O
is O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
keeping O
it O
because O
the O
cancer O
is O
there. O
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
tip. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
so O
much. O
I O
appreciate O
the O
support O
and O
kind O
words. O
We O
don’t O
have O
many O
choices O
except O
to O
save O
our O
lives. O
[SEP]
I O
want O
to O
eventually O
replace O
the O
implants O
with O
my O
own O
tissue. O
My O
first O
objective O
is O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
cancer O
first. O
Thank O
you O
for O
your O
lovely O
words. O
[SEP]
I’m O
sorry O
you O
had O
to O
go O
through O
this O
too. O

Are O
you O
me? O
I’m B-Age

36 I-Age
this B-Time

It’s O
so O
hard O
to O
accept O
all O
these O
massive O
changes. O
I O
hope O
you’re O
doing O
okay. O
BRCA2 O
is O
evil. O
I O
wish O
you O
all O
the O
best O
with O
your O
surgeries O
and O
healing. O
[SEP]
Thanks! O
I O
am O
doing O
pretty O
well O
I O
think! O
I O
get O
so O
anxious O
as O
my O
appts O
get O
closer. O
It's O
hard O
not O
knowing O
what O
to O
expect! O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
read O
through O
other O
people's O
experiences! O
Makes O
me O
feel O
less O
alone! O
Brca O
is O
evil O
for O
sure! O
Decimated O
my O
dad's O

of O
the O

so O
I O
feel O
fortunate O
that O
I O
became O
aware O
at O
a O

What O
did O
you O
mean O
to O
type O
instead O
of O
DCIS? O
DIEP O
maybe? O
[SEP]
Same! O
I O
had O
resigned O
myself O
to O
awful O
scars, O
but O
maybe O
they O
would O
look O
cool? O
Like O
war O
wounds? O
A O
car O
accident O
but O
I O
survived? O
Or O
maybe O
they O
wouldn’t O
be O
awful, O
but O
surely O
my O
breasts O
would O
never O
look O
good. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
When O
the O
scabs O
fell O
off O
from O
nipples O
(it O
took O
*ages* O
on O
one O
breast) O
I O
was O
stunned O
how O
good O
they O
looked. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
guess O
they O
will O
redo O
the O
incision O
edges O
when O
I O
have O
the O
spacers O
removed O
and O
the O
implants O
placed, O
and O
*then* O
they’ll O
be O
careful O
about O
the O
scars. O
Silicone O
coverings O
and O
such. O
I O
blurted O
out: O
“these O
the O
“bad” O
scars?!?” O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
scars O
are O
very O
thin, O
and O
only O
slightly O
red O
(which O
will O
fade). O
Where O
it O
is O
red, O
it O
perfectly O
matches O
the O
areola. O
They’re O
perky O
and O
even. O
I O
love O
them, O
and O
they O
aren’t O
even O
in O
their O
final O
form. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
hope O
this O
helps. O
I O
was O
vain O
about O
my O
nipples O
(it’s O
not O
good O
to O
be O
vain, O
but O
I O
was) O
and O
so O
I O
was O
scared O
how O
things O
would O
look. O
I O
hope O
my O
(anecdotal) O
data O
helps O
someone. O
[SEP]
It’s O
easy O
for O
me O
to O
say O
because O
I O
was O
lucky O
enough O
to O
keep O
both O
nipples, O
but O
looking O
at O
pictures O
of O
my O
PS’s O
work, O
I O
was O
shocked O
how O
good O
the O
“constructed” O
nipples O
looked. O
Then O
I O
assumed, O
oh, O
they O
look O
good O
now O
but O
will O
deteriorate O
or O
shrink O
or O
something O
in O
5 O
years. O
But O
her O
PA O
(who O
I O
trust O
perhaps O
most O
of O
all O
my O
cancer O
medical O
people) O
said O
that O
rarely O
happens. O
Anyway, O
this O
made O
me O
less O
scared O
at O
the O
potential O
mine O
would O
die O
or O
need O
to O
be O
removed. O
I O
mean, O
they O
looked O
*good*. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
haven’t O
seen O
pictures O
of O
3D O
tattoos, O
but O
from O
other O
people O
commenting, O
these O
can O
look O
great O
too. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Wishing O
a O
successful O
outcome O
for O
you, O
both O
cancer-wise O
and O
looks-wise. O
[SEP]
Lol... O
yep O
DIEP... O
darn O
autocorrect. O
[SEP]
I O
felt O
the O
same O
way! O
I O
refused O
to O
look O
at O
them O
after O
the O
mastectomy O
and O
tissue O
expander O
placement O
until O
my O
mom O
told O
me O
she O
was O
impressed O
at O
an O
appointment O
with O
the O
surgeon. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
did O
follow O
up O
with O
a O
PAP O
flap O
reconstruction O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
which O
came O
with O
a O
startling O
number O
of O
incisions. O
Everything O
is O
healing O
really O
well O
and O
I'm O
thrilled O
with O
the O
results. O
I O
will O
have O
some O
scars O
but O
nothing O
as O
disfiguring O
as O
I O
envisioned O
in O
my O
mind. O
My O
surgeon O
cut O
through O
a O
tattoo O
on O
the O
front O
of O
my O
hip O
and O
you O
can't O
even O
tell O
at O
3 O
weeks O
out. O
It's O
incredible. O
I O
am O
already O
much O
more O
comfortable O
in O
my O
skin O
that O
I O
anticipated O
at O
this O
stage. O
Now O
if O
only O
my O
hair O
could O
grow O
back O
faster! O

it’s O
benefitting O

There's O
been O
many O

that O
human's O
frontal O

where O
we O
logically O
weigh O
risks O
and O
think O
of O
the O

don't O
fully O
develop O
until O
our O
early O

On O
top O
of O
that, O
there's O
a O
lot O
of O
fantasy O

support O
for O
anyone O
that O
likes O
to O
deviate O

no O

even O

Very O
recently O
I O
went O
to O
a O
public O
concert O
where O
another O
attendee O
showed O
up O
in O
a O
head O
to O
toe O
anthropomorphic O
furry O
outfit. O
My O
spouse's O
immediate O
reaction O
was O
to O
exhale O
and O
say, O
"Well O
I O
don't O
think O
anyone O
will O
be O
looking O
too O
closely O
at O
*me* O
tonight." O
We O
came O
to O
learn O
later O
that O
night O
that O
he O
now O
lives O
full O
time O
as O
his O
"fursona", O
using O
only O
his O
fursona O
name. O
He's O
married, O
works O
from O
home O
full O
time O
in O
IT, O
and O
his O
spouse O
was O
with O
him. O
I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
his O
spouse O
supports O
him, O
but O
she O
honestly O
looked O
pretty O
uncomfortable O
and O
resigned O
anytime O
I O
dared O
to O
look. O
No O
way O
to O
know O
how O
old O
he O
was, O
but O
it O
had O
to O
be O
late O
20's O
early O
30's O
if O
it O
matched O
the O
age O
of O
his O
wife. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Certainly O
gave O
me O
a O
lot O
to O
think O
about O
since O
then... O
I O
imagine O
that O
was O
an O
interesting O
conversation O
to O
have O
with O
his O
immediate O
family. O
Sort O
of O
puts O
a O
lot O
of O
perspective O
on O
"coming O
out, O
being O
brave, O
living O
your O
truth." O
My O
spouse, O
for O
all O
their O
journey's, O
didn't O
seem O
very O
supportive. O
I O
still O
don't O
know O
how O
I O
feel, O
other O
than... O
sympathy. O
I'm O
afraid O
to O
look O
into O
it O
more O
too, O
lest O
the O
algorithms O
take O
my O
curiosity O
for O
earnest O
interest. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
will O
say, O
from O
what O
I O
have O
observed, O
is O
that O
*a O
lot* O
of O
young O
people O
simply O
consider O
transitioning O
"an O
option" O
versus O
an O
affirmation; O
and O
often O
with O
the O
argument O
that, O
"people O
should O
just O
be O
allowed O
to O
do O
what O
they O
want, O
it's O
not O
hurting O
anyone O
right?" O
[SEP]
I O
know, O
this O
shit O
makes O
me O
so O
anxious O
for O
everyone. O
Younger O
and O
older. O
This O
shit O
is O
serious O
and O
life O
changing O
but O
no, O
let's O
get O
riskyyyyy🎉 O
😮‍💨 O
[SEP]
Like O
most O
things O
today O
unfortunately. O
Look O
at O
covid O
imo O
it O
should O
have O
never O
been O
a O
political O
thing O
and O
only O
a O
100% O
scientific O
thing. O
I O
hate O
the O
current O
state O
of O
politics O
[SEP]
That O
worries O
me O
too. O
My O
spouse O
is O
intersex O
and O
after O
going O
back O
and O
forth, O
being O
on O
both O
E O
and O
T O
trying O
to O
figure O
themselves O
out, O
they O
now O
consider O
themselves O
nonbinary. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
recently O
read O
that O
as O
many O
as O
2% O
of O
people O
are O
intersex, O
about O
the O
same O
rate O
as O
people O
with O
red O
hair. O
So O
if O
you've O
met O
someone O
with O
red O
hair, O
you've O
probably O
met O
someone O
who O
is O
intersex. O
In O
addition O
to O
my O
spouse O
I O
currently O
know O
a O
woman O
who O
is O
quite O
tall, O
grows O
a O
full O
beard O
(has O
an O
obvious O
five O
o'clock O
shadow O
otherwise), O
and O
visually O
doesn't O
pass O
for O
female O
very O
well. O
But, O
she O
IS O
female, O
genuinely O
FAB, O
and O
has O
had O
children. O
I O
don't O
remember O
the O
specifics O
are O
for O
her O
medical O
diagnosis, O
but O
her O
existence O
has O
been O
a O
valuable O
lesson O
to O
concepts O
held O
by O
others. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Many O
people O
I O
know O
believe O
as O
I O
do, O
that O
it's O
entirely O
natural O
to O
be O
homosexual O
(or O
bisexual O
within O
a O
spectrum O
of O
homo O
and O
hetero). O
But O
many O
people O
think O
there O
is O
only O
male O
or O
female, O
and O
scientifically O
I O
know O
that O
there's O
a O
hell O
of O
a O
lot O
more O
variables O
regarding O
sex. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
After O
a O
lot O
of O
study O
(and O
I'm O
talking O
20+ O
years O
here) O
I'm O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
true O
transexuals O
do O
exist O
and O
are O
inherently O
intersex, O
and O
that O
depending O
on O
the O
medical O
diagnosis O
there's O
a O
spectrum O
there O
too, O
but O
the O
peer O
science O
is O
lacking. O
And O
that O
spectrum O
can O
change-- O
there O
was O
a O
case O
of O
an O
intersex O
man O
with O
Klinefelter's O
whom O
after O
an O
illness O
their O
adrenals O
reset O
and O
their O
body O
went O
with O
the O
XX O
instead O
of O
the O
XY O
of O
their O
natural O
XXY O
state. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Thus, O
he O
grew O
breasts O
and O
his O
body O
began O
naturally O
feminizing. O
Having O
always O
felt O
female O
privately, O
once O
their O
body O
changed, O
that O
person O
chose O
to O
transition. O
Whether O
or O
not O
they O
got O
bottom O
surgery O
I O
don't O
know, O
but O
they O
were O
effectively O
a O
woman O
with O
working O
male O
sex O
organs O
otherwise. O
Again, O
it O
bothers O
me O
greatly O
when O
people O
argue O
that O
intersex O
people O
still O
must O
be O
one O
or O
the O
other, O
like O
there O
can't O
somehow O
be O
a O
spectrum O
there O
too. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
helpful O
if O
genetic O
and O
medical O
testing O
were O
stardard O
as O
part O
of O
transitioning, O
including O
endocrine O
testing O
and O
mapped O
neurology O
via O
MRI, O
but O
that O
would O
call O
into O
question O
that O
there's O
more O
to O
it O
than O
belief O
or O
that O
people O
should O
simply O
be O
free O
to O
do O
as O
they O
wish. O
This O
is O
further O
exacerbated O
in O
places O
like O
the O
USA O
where O
transitioning O
has O
become O
somewhat O
common O
but O
otherwise O
medicine O
in O
general O
is O
pretty O
abysmal. O
[SEP]
The O
people O
acting O
out O
their O
hentai O
feminization O
fantasies, O
and O
the O
doctors O
making O
money O
off O
it. O
[SEP]
To O
the O
question-- O
so O
are O
they O
in O
their O
fursuit O
now O
24-7? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
assume O
the O
answer O
is O
mostly? O
Logically O
I'm O
pretty O
sure O
they O
don't O
shower O
in O
it. O
We O
went O
to O
the O
concert O
with O
several O
friends. O
One O
of O
my O
friends O
had O
a O
panic O
attack O
so O
security O
took O
them O
out O
of O
the O
venue O
for O
a O
bit, O
another O
friend O
went O
with O
them O
as O
a O
support O
person O
and O
they O
were O
taken O
to O
a O
quieter O
area O
to O
get O
some O
air. O
The O
person O
in O
their O
fursuit O
and O
his O
wife O
was O
also O
there, O
because O
being O
around O
so O
many O
people O
in O
the O
fursuit O
they O
kept O
overheating. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
friend O
who O
was O
the O
support O
person O
is O
utterly O
fearless O
and O
didn't O
waste O
the O
opportunity O
to O
chat O
them O
up, O
which O
is O
how O
we O
found O
out O
they're O
living O
full-time O
as O
their O
fursona O
now. O
They O
can O
eat O
in O
it, O
but O
my O
friend O
didn't O
inquire O
about O
other... O
functions. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
On O
the O
drive O
home O
that O
night O
my O
spouse O
remarked O
that O
if O
they're O
in O
it O
full O
time O
and O
they're O
overheating O
then O
it O
must O
get O
pretty O
sweaty O
and O
smelly O
and O
they O
must O
have O
to O
get O
it O
dry O
cleaned. O
They O
must O
have O
multiple O
sets O
of O
the O
suit O
too. O
It O
was O
a O
clearly O
custom-made O
high O
quality O
fursuit, O
I O
can't O
imagine O
it's O
having O
been O
inexpensive. O
Getting O
multiple O
made O
at O
the O
same O
time O
probably O
would O
have O
been O
somewhat O
cost-effective? O

What O
is O
disorganized O

[SEP]
I O
used O
to O

i O
was O
on O
the O
avoidant O
side O
of O
attachment O
styles O
until O
i O
found O
myself O
in O
two O
different O

( O
at O

times O
in O
my O
life O
btw, O
but O
each O
a O

where O
i O
leaned O
into O
anxious O
attachment. O
Growing O
and O
learning O
about O
my O
patterns, O
taking O

etc O
has O
lead O
me O
to O
believe O
I O
actually O
have O
disorganized O

which O
is O
like O
a O
whole O
mixed O
up O
can O
of O
worms. O
My B-Family
family I-Family
can I-Family
be I-Family
very I-Family
loving I-Family
and I-Family
supportive, I-Family
but I-Family
something I-Family
i I-Family
realized I-Family
young I-Family
is I-Family
that I-Family
no I-Family
one I-Family
in I-Family
my I-Family
family I-Family
let’s I-Family
others I-Family
speak, I-Family
there I-Family
is I-Family
very I-Family
little I-Family

that I-Family
goes I-Family
on I-Family

alot I-Family

This O
is O
something O
that O
deeply O
affected O
me O
as O
a O

and O
still O
now, O
the O
subject O

A O

When O
I O
would O
throw O
a O
tantrum, O
my O
parents O
(mainly O
my O

would O
tell O
me O
to O
go O
into O
the O
bathroom, O
shut O
the O
door, O
and O
not O
come O
out. O
I O
would O
scream, O

The O

I O

up O

we O

up O

Around O
this O
time, O
I B-Mental_Health
began I-Mental_Health
showing I-Mental_Health
signs I-Mental_Health
of I-Mental_Health
depression I-Mental_Health
and I-Mental_Health
anxiety. I-Mental_Health
I O
was O
formally O
diagnosed O
and O
my O

was O
very O
supportive O
of O
getting O
me O
help O
(getting O
me O
into O
the O
doctor, O
encouraging O
medication, O
etc.)! O
I O
started O
missing O
a O
lot O
of O
school O
during O
this O
time O
due O
to O
my O
mental O
health. O
My O
parents O
and O
I O
fought O
nearly O
every O
single O
day O
because O
I O
wouldn’t O
want O
to O
go O
to O
school. O
One O
night, O
after O
my O
parents O
and O
I O
had O
finished O
arguing O
about O
it, O
I O
overheard O
them O
talking O
about O
me. O
Being O
a O
nosy O
little O

I O
eavesdropped O
and O
heard O
my O
dad O
say O
that O
my O
mental O
illnesses O
were O
not O
real O
(he O
has O
a O
minor O
in O
psych. O
So, O
understandably, O
this O
made O
me O
doubt O
myself O
a O

By O
the O
time O
I O
was O
around O
14-15, O
I O
was O
sick O
of O
being O
forced O
to O
go O
to O
work O
with O
my O
mom O
at O
her O
small O
business O
(also, O
at O

time, O
I O
had O
transferred O
to O
an O
online O
school O
due O
to O
mental O
&amp; O
physical O
health O
reasons). O
So, O
I O
would O
ask O
to O
stay O
home O
instead. O
My O
mom O
usually O
let O
me O
stay O
home O
every O
single O
time O
that O
I O
asked. O
I O
would O
typically O
be O
home O
alone O
from O
10am-8pm O
during O
this O
time. O
My B-Family
parents I-Family
worked I-Family
a I-Family

I I-Family

saw I-Family
them. I-Family
One O

I O
even O
stayed O
home O
alone O
all O
day O
on O
my O
birthday O
(I O
think O
I O
was O
turning O
15 O
or O
16). O
Yes, O
I O
did O
ask O
to O
stay O
home. O
However, O
I O
really O
feel O
like O
they O
could’ve O
made O
an O
effort O
to O
not O
neglect O
(?) O
me O
completely. O

My O
dad O
and O
I O
were O
in O
the O
car O
together O
one O
day O
(I O
was O
driving) O
when O
we O
drove O
past O
a O
slew O
of O
protesters O
in O
our O
city. O
He O
asked O
what O
they O
were O
protesting, O
and O
I O
told O
him O
that O
they O
were O
“pro-lifers” O
protesting O
on O
the O
opposite O
street O
of O
a O
non-profit O
women’s O
clinic O
(this O
clinic O
offers O
free O
pregnancy O
tests, O
ultrasounds, O
and O
doesn’t O
even O
perform O
abortions O
nor O
refers O
patients). O
My B-Family
dad, I-Family
being I-Family
a I-Family
pro-lifer, I-Family
began I-Family
going I-Family
on I-Family
a I-Family
tangent I-Family
about I-Family
being I-Family
pro-life I-Family
and I-Family
why I-Family
abortion I-Family
was I-Family
morally I-Family
wrong. I-Family
Me, B-Stance
being I-Stance
pro-choice, I-Stance
naturally O
began O
debating O
him. O
When O
things O
got O
too O
heated, O
I O
politely O
asked O
him O
to O
stop O
because O
I O
was O
getting O
angry O
and O
wanted O
to O
drop O
it. O
He O
kept O
going, O
and O
I O
kept O
asking O
him O
to O
stop. O
Finally, O
I O
snapped O
and O
began O
yelling O
at O
him O
(which O
I O
knew O
would O
happen). O
He O
told O
me O
to O
“pull O
the O
fucking O
car O
over” O
and O
that O
he O
would O
“walk O
home”. O
He O
got O
out O
of O
the O
car, O
I O
asked O
him O
to O
get O
back O
in, O
and O
he O
refused. O
So, O
I O
drove O
home O
without O
him. O
I O
was O
home O
with O
my O
mom O
(who O
was O
trying O
to O
calm O
me O
down) O
for O
about O
30-40 O
minutes. O
My O
dad O
finally O
walks O
in, O
slams O
the O
door, O
and O
starts O
yelling O
at O
me O
for O
not O
turning O
around O

getting O
him. O

hey O
friend, O
sorry O
you're O
going O
through O

feeling O

you O
to O
create O
a O
space O
of O
healing O
and O
change O
while O
still O
living O
with O
her, O
but O
it's O
possible O
to O
start. O
first, O
try O
writing O
her O
a O
letter O
with O
all O
the O
things O
you O
want O
to O
say, O
and O
then O
-this O
is O
critical- O
burn O
the O
letter. O
your O
mother O
is O
not O
emotionally O
mature O
or O
capable O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
give O
you O
the O
closure O
you O
need O
and O
to O
meet O
you O
on O
the O
level O
you O
need O
from O
her, O
and O
I'm O
sorry O
about O
that. O
It's O
a O
hard O
thing O
to O
hear O
and O
harder O
still O
to O
accept, O
but O
that O
is O
part O
of O
the O
process. O
Confronting O
your O
mother O
won't O
help O
you O
right O

and O
may O

During O
the O
past O
year O
or O
so, O
they've O
faced O
the O
following O
very O
odd O
issue: O
randomly, O
during O
the O
day, O
they O
are O
unable O
to O
access O
said O
websites O
from O
their O
office's O
internet O
connection. O
All O
browsers O
report O
a O
connection O
timeout O
issue. O
The O
websites O
however O
are O
still O
up O
and O
accesible O
- O
just O
not O
through O
their O
office O
internet O
connection O
and O
by O
extension O
through O
their O
public O
IP, O
assigned O
to O
them O
by O
their O
ISP. O
When O
connecting O
via O
a O
VPN O
for O
example, O
the O
websites O
work. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
After O
restarting O
their O
modem/router, O
they O
are O
assigned O
a O
new O
public O
IP O
by O
their O
ISP, O
and O
the O
websites O
load O
once O
again, O
only O
to O
randomly O
stop O
working O
after O
a O
few O
hours. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
the O
guy O
who'd O
been O
subcontracted O
to O
built O
the O
websites O
and O
configured O
the O
apache O
server O
&amp; O
Plesk O
says O
that O
he O
can't O
see O
anything O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
-but O
he's O
not O
helpful O
at O
all, O
always O
giving O
excuses O
that O
he O
can't O
look O
into O
this. O
It's O
obvious O
to O
me O
this O
is O
a O
server O
side O
issue O
-there O
are O
at O
most O
about O
5 O
or O
6 O
computers O
on O
the O
office O
network, O
sharing O
its O
internet O
access, O
4 O
are O
M1 O
Macs, O
2 O
are O
PCs, O
with O
clean O
Windows O
installs O
-nothing O
suspicious O
running O
on O
these O
computers O
that O
could O
trigger O
a O
particularly O
sensitive O
firewall O
rule O
on O
Hetzner's O
side. O
The O
wordpress O
sites O
are O
edited O
either O
via O
WPBakery O
or O
Elementor. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Are O
there O
any O
WP O
plugins O
that O
could O
be O
causing O
this O
'blacklisting' O
of O
their O
public O
IP? O
I O
was O
discussing O
this O
issue O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
recommended O
that O
perhaps O
the O
firewall O
on O
Hetzner's O
side O
gets O
triggered O
due O
to O
too O
many O
POST O
requests O
when O
editing O
said O
websites, O
which O
usually O
happens O
with O
third O
party O
website O
building O
tools. O
But O
this O
connection O
issue O
occurs O
randomly, O
even O
when O
they O
haven't O
touched O
the O
websites O
for O
the O
entire O
day. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Does O
anyone O
have O
any O
ideas? O
[SEP]
I O
think O
you're O
on O
the O
right O
path, O
very O
likely O
something O
coming O
from O
the O
network O
is O
triggering O
a O
firewall/IDS O
rule O
on O
Hetzner O
server/network O
that's O
triggering O
this O
lock O
out O
behavior. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
It's O
probably O
easiest O
to O
ask O
Hetzner O
about O
it, O
but O
if O
they O
are O
uncooperative O
then O
you'll O
have O
to O
watch O
your O
outgoing O
traffic O
with O
some O
sort O
of O
tool O
and O
hope O
you O
can O
find O
something. O
Presumably O
the O
connection O
is O
encrypted, O
so O
this O
could O
get O
difficult. O
[SEP]
The O
plan O
they O
have O
with O
Hetzner O
is O
a O
very O
basic O
hosting O
plan. O
Essentially O
Hetzner O
said O
'you O
configured O
the O
server/firewall/wordpress O
stuff, O
we O
just O
provide O
the O
VM O
these O
run O
on, O
so O
you O
are O
responsible O
for O
making O
sure O
it O
works O
right, O
we O
can't O
assist O
in O
this'. O
[SEP]
Okay, O
yeah, O
the O
guy O
that O
set O
it O
up O
is O
the O
only O
one O
that O
knows O
what O
he O
did. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
guess O
you O
could O
have O
another O
expert O
look O
at O
what's O
configured, O
but O
this O
isn't O
some O
easy O
thing O
to O
figure O
out. O
I O
can O
think O
of O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
that O
could O
cause O
this. O
From O
Wordpress O
plugins O
to O
IDSes, O
Apache O
modules, O
etc. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
One O
very O
quick O
workaround O
you O
could O
try O
is O
reconfiguring O
the O
firewall O
with O
an O
ACCEPT O
rule O
for O
the O
Office O
IP O
as O
the O
first O
rule. O
That O
way O
any O
later O
rules O
made O
by O
some O
sort O
of O
solution O
can't O
block O
the O
office O
IP. O

i’m O

a O
bit O
of O
a O
dilemma, O
i’ll O
try O
to O
be O
as O
concise O
as O
i O
can O
be O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
a O
28 B-Age
y.o. I-Age
guy B-Gender
and O
the B-Relationship_Status
girl I-Relationship_Status
i I-Relationship_Status
dated I-Relationship_Status
till I-Relationship_Status
recently I-Relationship_Status
is B-Age
23. I-Age
I O
met O
her O
4 O
months O
ago O
and O
since O
then O
we’ve O
been O
together, O
and O
our O
relationship O
was O
so O
nice, O
without O
any O
arguments, O
or O
fights O
or O
anything. O
We O
understood O
eachother O
at O
a O
deeper O
level. O
We O
did O
all O
things O
together O
(e.g O
cooking, O
cleaning, O
etc.). O
About O
a O
week O
ago O
or O
so, O
she O
said O
she O
needs O
time O
for O
her O
to O
solve O
her O
personal O
issue, O
and O
she O
said O
that O
she O
can’t O
do O
that O
while O
being O
with O
me O
because O
she O
doesn’t O
want O
to O
hurt O
me O
with O
her O
behaviour/ O
problems. O
She’s O
going O
to O
go O
through O
a O
dermatological O
intervention, O
she’ll O
have O
a O
5 O
week O
exam O
session O
and O
has O
to O
write O
her O
bachelor’s O
degree O
as O
she’s O
in O
the O
last O
year O
of O
Uni. O
I O
gave O
her O
the O
space O
she O
needed O
after O
we O
talked, O
and O
since O
then O
we’ve O
talked O
a O
bit, O
but O
obviously O
the O
conversation O
is O
not O
as O
it O
was O
before. O
She O
said O
she O
doesn’t O
want O
for O
me O
to O
wait O
for O
her, O
because O
it O
would O
make O
her O
feel O
bad. O
In O
the O
meanwhile O
i B-Other
decided I-Other
to I-Other
stop I-Other
smoking I-Other
drinking(haven’t I-Other
been I-Other
drinking I-Other
a I-Other
lot I-Other
before I-Other
either, I-Other
but O
it O
messes O
with O
my O
training) O
and O
hitting O
the O
Gym O
to O
distract O
myself O
from O
thinking O
of O
her. O
My O
question O
is, O
should O
i O
wait O
for O
her O
to O
solve O
her O
stuff O
and O
get O
back O
together, O
even O
if O
that O
means O
waiting O
for O
half O
a O
year O
or O
so O
or O
should O
i O
just O
forget O
about O
her? O
I O
know O
she O
asked O
this O
for O
the O
right O
reasons, O
because O
she’s O
got O
a O
lot O
on O
her O
plate O
right O
now. O

My O
*honest* O
opinion O

neither O

is O
that O

want O

it O
out O
because O

does O
not O
want O

From O
what O
you O
said, O
it O
sounds O
like O
she O
wants O
you O
to O
move O
on O
from O
her, O
because O
she O
has O
no O
intention O
of O
getting O
back O

[SEP]
[SEP]
It O
may O
not O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
you. O
She O
just O
seems O
busy, O

maybe O
she's O
trying O
to O
do O
the O
mature O
thing O
and O
end O
your O
relationship O
out O
of O
fairness O
to O
you O
before O
she O
gets O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
emotionally O
neglectful. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Either O
way, O
she O
has O
communicated O
her O
desires O
to O
you. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Personally, O
I O
would O
back O
entirely O
off. O
Don't O
reach O
out O
to O
her. O
Don't O
place O
yourself O
on O
her O
path O
if O
you O
can O
possibly O
avoid O
it O
because O
it O
will O
be O
obvious O
that O
you're O
just O
trying O
to O
see O
her. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Let O
her O
come O
to O
you. O
If O
she O
decides O
things O
are O
worse O
without O
you, O
she'll O
let O
you O
know. O
In O
the O
meantime, O
you O
should O
work O
on O
accepting O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
situation. O
These O
things O
are O
the O
test O
of O
a O
person, O
and O
right O
now O
you O
have O
an O
opportunity O
to O
respond O
with O
respect O

dignity O

the O
needs O

someone O
you O
care O

try O

to O
the O
idea O

not O
being O
together O

all O
anymore, O
even O
in O
the O

It O
may O
be O
painful O
and O
difficult, O

the O
sooner O
you O
do O
it, O
the O
sooner O
you O
will O
heal. O
You O
have O
to O
decide O
that O
you O
wouldn't O
get O
back O
together O

her O
even O
if O
she O
asked O
you O
to. O

someone O
when O
your O

My B-Family

one I-Family
with I-Family
some I-Family

the I-Family
other I-Family

what I-Family
they I-Family
consider I-Family
decent I-Family

and I-Family
are I-Family
making I-Family
around I-Family
$50k I-Family
. O
Both O
are O
a O
major O
car O
problem O
from O
going O
into O
debt. O
OK, O
they O
should O
eventually O
start O
making O
more O
money, O
but O
if O
you O
start O
putting O
money O
away O
at O
35, O
you O
aren't O
gong O
to O
be O
able O
to O
retire O
on O
the O
money O
you O
saved. O
If O
you O
cut O
entitlements O
but O
then O
cut O
the O
money O
you O
are O
bringing O
in, O
so O
people O
can O
invest O
by O
themselves O
how O
is O

401k, O

are O
all O

If O
you O
are O
just O
finding O
out O
now O
you O
need O
1M, O
that’s O
on O
you O
and O
not O
the O

[SEP]
[SEP]
Ask O
your O
kids O
if O
they O
are O
aware O
and O
if O
not, O
it’s O
not O
too O
late O
to O
teach O
them O
financial O
principles. O
[SEP]
We O
have O
passed O
a O
tipping O
point. O
Over O
half O
American's O
primary O
source O
of O
income O
is O
now O
government O
sources. O
That O
is O
not O
sustainable, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
serious O
effort O
with O
real O
solutions O
to O
solve O
the O
problem. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Too O
many O
in O
the O
political O
class O
are O
invested O
in O
the O
system O
as O
is O
and O
changing O
it O
would O
be O
too O
painful O
for O
financial O
supporters O
and O
constituents. O
So, O
our O
society O
is O
on O
a O
great O
wind O
down. O
How O
long O
will O
it O
take O
for O
total O
collapse? O
No O
one O
knows. O
But O
every O
society O
eventually O
outstrips O
their O
ability O
to O
pay O
for O
what O
their O
government O
wants. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Save O
your O
money, O
invest O
broadly O
and O
don't O
worry. O
We O
are O
but O
helpless O
pawns O
blow O
about O
by O
the O
winds O
of O
historical O
patterns O
beyond O
our O
control. O
[SEP]
My O
generations O

plan O
is O
probably O
to O
die O
in O
the O
climate O
wars O
so O
im O
not O
too O
fussed O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
An O
answer O
less O
tinged O
with O
existential O
dread O
is O
that O
I O
plan O
go O
focus O
a O
lot O
on O
establishing O
passive O
income O
streams O
[SEP]
They O
will O
suffer. O
I O
don’t O
mean O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
deserved O
but O
that O
is O
a O
fact. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Similar O
to O
the O
generational O
poverty O
seen O
in O
urban O
African O
American O
communities O
starting O
in O
the O
1970’s O
fulled O
by O
a O
drug O
epidemic. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Rural O
communities O
are O
now O
experiencing O
the O
first O
wave O
of O
this. O
It O
will O
get O
worse O
before O
it O
gets O
better. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Who O
knows O
how O
long O
it O
will O
take O
for O
these O
communities O
to O
focus O
on O
their O
own O
financial O
and O
health O
needs O
instead O
of O
voting O
for O
politicians O
that O
legislate O
on O
populist O
social O
issues? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
a O
libertarian O
I O
don’t O
really O
care O
anymore, O
every O
American O
makes O
choices O
at O
the O
voting O
booth O
and O
decides O
what O
important O
to O
themselves. O
[SEP]
You O
should O
probably O
look O
at O
your O
budget. O
Your O
sons O
should O
look O
at O
future O
expected O
earnings. O
[SEP]
Speaking O
for O
myself, O
I'd O
be O
happy O
to O
opt O
out O
of O
Social O
Security, O
as O
long O
as O
I O
got O
a O
one-time O
payment O
of O
all O
my O
contributions O
plus O
3% O
interest. O
[SEP]
If O
we're O
not O
paying O
so O
much O
money O
for O
entitlements, O
your O
taxes O
go O
down O
so O
you O
have O
more O
money O
to O
invest. O

So, O
money O
you O

you O

even O

And O
again, O

I O
don't O
have O

how O
do O
they O

I'm O

Both O
are O
what O
I O
would O
consider O

that O
any O

[SEP]

My B-Family
dad I-Family

are I-Family
all I-Family
over I-Family

You O
aren't O
getting O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
back, O
And O
certainly O
you O
would O
be O
broke O
if O
you O
had O
their O
medical O
expenses. O
[SEP]
By O
how O
much? O
are O
we O
cutting O

to O
cut O
down O
or O
stop O

or O
are O
we O
cutting O
it O

something O
I'm O
not. O
If O
we O
cut O
both O
entitlements O
and O
how O
we O
pay O
for O
them O
we O
aren't O
doing O
as O
much. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So, O
I'll O
ask, O
have O
you O
spent O
money O
you O
should O
have O
saved? O
Is O
it O
absurd O
to O
take O
that O
money O
and O
repair O
your O
car O
so O
you O
can O
get O
to O
work? O
How O
about O
paying O
for O
your O
kid's O
surgery? O
And O
in O
35 O
years O
you O
just O
don't O
have O
the O
money O
to O
retire. O
I O
feel O
confident O
that O
most O
people O
aren't O
going O
have O
to O
make O
that O
decision O
sometime O
in O
their O
life. O
[SEP]
It's O
a O
nice O
theory O
that O
doesn't O
work O
in O
practice. O
Social O
security O
attackers O
seem O
to O
forget O
that O
SS O
hasn't O
been O
around O
forever. O
And O
before O
it O
was O
around, O
their O
was O
a O
lot O
more O
elderly O
poverty. O

the O
elderly O
weren't O
even O

nearly O
as O
long O
as O
they O
do O

don’t O
see O
the O
difference? O
[SEP]
Hey O
man. O
Well O
argued O

I O
find O
this O
news O
disconcerting. O
[SEP]
eh O
it's O
still O
debatable. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
give O
lend O
money O
to O
a O
company O
so O
they O
can O
buy O
assets O
or O
pay O
employees O
to O
provide O
goods O

services, O
that's O
clearly O

value. O

If O
you O
buy O
property O
for O
the O
sole O
purpose O

charging O
others O
to O
use O
it, O
I O
don't O
really O
see O
the O
contribution. O
[SEP]
You O
really O
don't O
understand O
what O
the O
average O
person O
makes. O
I'm O
using O
my O
family O
as O
an O
example, O
but O
they O
will O
be O
fine. O
The O
point O
is O
that O
even O
people O
in O
those O
positions O
aren't O
in O
a O
position O
to O
put O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
away. O
Yes, O
plenty O

people O
can O
do O
what O
you O

more O
and O
more O
people O
just O
aren't O
making O
that O
kind O
of O
money. O

of O

not O

losers, O
one O
out O

makes O
$15 O

less. O
it O
is O

1/3 O

less. O

People O
who O
work O
full O
time O
for O
say O
Walmart, O
still O
qualify O
for O
SNAP O
or O
Medicaid O
if O
they O
have O
a O
kid, O
but O
are O
a O
holes O
for O
not O
putting O
a O
few O
hundred O
away O
every O

[SEP]
Wait O
a O
minute: O
You O
are O
saying O
that O
six O
years O
of O
schoolteachers O
salary, O
with O
living O
expenses O
(assuming O
frugal O
living, O
of O
course) O
both O
wiped O
the O
debt O
and O
established O
a O
safe, O
guaranteed O
investment O
that O
is O
going O
to O
be O
1.3 O
million O
by O
retirement, O
with O
no O
contribution? O
Unless O
you O
are O
leaving O
out O
a O
very O
specific O
lucky O
break O
(like O
accidentially O
dumped O
5000 O
bucks O
into O
Bitcoin O
at O
the O
start O
or O
some O
such), O
I O
have O
some O
serious O
doubts O
this O
is O
even O
remotely O
repeatable, O
especially O
the O
part O
about O
the O
1.3 O
mill O
being O
guaranteed O
without O
contributions. O
A O
TON O
of O
high-end O
investment O
bankers O
would O
love O
that O
secret. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Or O
are O
we O
talking O
mid-to-late O
20th O
century O
here, O
and O
you O
already O
retired? O
I O
am O
no O
slouch O
in O
terms O
of O
financials, O
I O
run O
a O
business, O
and O
I O
even O
know O
a O
schoolteacher O
in O
the O
USA, O
but O
I O
see O
no O
way O
of O
making O
that O
work O
today. O
[SEP]
>I O
had O
undergrad O
debt O
and O
lived O
on O
a O
schoolteacher’s O
salary O
for O
six O
years O
after O
undergrad. O
I O
saved O
up O
enough O
by O
age O
28 O
to O
just O
let O
it O
sit O
and O
grow O
to O
$1,300,000 O
by O
retirement, O
even O
assuming O
no O
future O
contributions O
at O
all. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Ummmm....He's O
not O
you? O
And O
I O
don't O
think O
he O
asking O
you O
for O
financial O
advice O
either. O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
and O
if O
you O
have O
1.3 O
you O
didn't O
graduate O
in O
the O
last O
20 O
or O
30 O
years. O
You O
also O
have O
to O
understand O
that O
you O
also O
invested O
during O
the O
greatest O
time O
to O
invest O
in O
history. O
So O
how O
much O
of O
that O
money O
you O
invested O
was O
put O
into O
your O
investment O
account O
by O
your O
employer? O
Most O
companies O
don't O
do O
that O
anymore, O
they O
don't O
even O
match. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now, O
remember O
what O
you O
made O
just O
after O
college, O
plug O
it O
into O
an O
inflation O
calculator O
and O
I O
almost O
guarantee O
that O
you O
made O
a O
lot O
more O
money O
than O
what O
would O
be O
say O
$45k O
today. O
Which O
is O
what O
a O
lot O
of O
companies O
want O
to O
pay O
a O
recent O
college O
grad. O
Lastly, O
while O
I O
am O
guessing, O
even O
after O
inflation, O
your O
student O
debt O
isn't O
what O
most O
students O
have. O
[SEP]
If O
you O
don't O
think O
you'll O
make O
it O
past O
75, O
you O
best O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
saved O
for O
medical O
care. O
[SEP]
What O
is O
confusing? O
I O
said O
government O
provides O
over O
half O
the O
primary O
income O
for O
more O
than O
50% O
of O
the O
nation. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Employees O
are O
part O
of O
that O
number. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
They O
have O
a O
vested O
interest O
in O
the O
growth, O
stability O
and O
support O
of O
government, O
as O
do O
all O
of O
the O
groups O
listed. O
People O
do O
not O
generally O
vote O
against O
personal O
interests. O
[SEP]
As O
a O
socialist O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
comforting. O
For O
me O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
disconcerting, O
but O
as O
a O
student O
of O
poli-sci O
and O
observer O
of O
gov O
since O
the O
80s O
it O
is O
the O
natural O
pattern O
of O
all O
governments. O
Not O
surprising. O
[SEP]
> O
If O
you O
buy O
property O
for O
the O
sole O
purpose O
of O
charging O
others O
to O
use O
it, O
I O
don't O
really O
see O
the O
contribution. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Even O
there O
you O
are O
contributing O
the O
property. O
Contributing O
the O
factors O
of O
production O
be O
they O
land O
or O
factory O
equipment O
IS O
a O
contribution O
to O
production. O
[SEP]
> O
The O
point O
is O
that O
even O
people O
in O
those O

in O
a O

put O
that O
kind O
of O
money O
away. O

Again, O
25% O

one O
out O

is O

5-10 O

out O
of O
the O
~140 O

be O
earning O
the O
same O
$15/hour O
a O

from O
now.. O
and O
if O
they O
are O
that's O
a O

you'd O

yes O
by O

if O
you're O
not O
able O
to O
put O
at O

a O
little O
something O
away O
for O

each O

the O

is O
with O
you. O
WalMart O
will O
even O
kick O
in O
an O

which O
makes O
it O
that O
much O
easier. O
Though O
I'd O

keeping O
your O

it's O

a O

do O
better O

at O
35 O

you O
almost O
certainly O
have O
the O

to O
do O
better O

$15/hour O
or O
should O
be O
very O
eager O
to O
gain O
it. O
[SEP]
Yes. O
I B-Finance
was I-Finance
making I-Finance
$65k I-Finance
a I-Finance
year I-Finance
and I-Finance
had I-Finance
around I-Finance
$20k I-Finance
in I-Finance
debt. I-Finance
It O
was O
this O
past O
decade. O
I O
saved O
around O
$130k, O
which O
will O
grow O
to O
$1M. O
But O
starting O
next O
year O
I O
will O
make O
$300+k O
so O
obviously O
I O
can O
save O
more. O
[SEP]
No, O
you O
misunderstand. O
I O
graduated O
within O
the O
last O
decade. O
Virtually O
none O
of O
the O
money O
was O
put O
into O
investment O
by O
my O
employer. O
[SEP]
> O
Yeah, O
and O
if O
you O
have O
1.3 O
you O
didn't O
graduate O
in O
the O
last O
20 O
or O
30 O
years. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
He's O
not O
saying O
he O
has O
$1.3 O
NOW O
but O
that O
he O
will O
be O
the O
time O
he O
retires O
given O
what O
he's O
already O
put O
into O
his O
account O
assuming O
historic O
average O
returns... O
That O
will O
only O
go O
up O
dramatically O
as O
he O
continues O
to O
contribute O
over O
the O
years. O
[SEP]
Mines O
more O
because O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
rely O
on O
any O
government O
program. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Plus O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
long O
term O
health O
problems. O
[SEP]
Working O
isn’t O
an O
entitlement O
[SEP]
Y'all O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
twisted O
view O
of O
socialist. O
It's O
not O
synonymous O
with O
big O
govt O
and O
command O
economies. O
We're O
not O
all O
Leninists O
or O
Maoists. O
American O
socialist O
traditions O
tend O
to O
be O
a O
lot O
more O
libertarian O
and O
decentralized O
than O
their O
European O
and O
Asian O
counterparts, O
organized O
around O
unions O
or O
other O
non-governmental O
organizations. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
classic O
formulation O
for O
socialism O
is O
"workers O
control O
the O
means O
of O
productions O
(and O
transportation, O
development, O
etc.)". O
Does O
today's O
federal O
government O
strike O
you O
as O
particularly O
pro-worker? O
[SEP]
No, O
the O
property O
already O
existed O
prior O
to O
your O
purchase. O
If O
you O
bought O
empty O
land O
and O
built O
homes O
on O
it, O
sure O
now O
I O
see O
a O
contribution. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
buy O
existing O
property O
you O
didn't O
do O
anything, O
ownership O
just O
changed. O
If O
you O
say O
you O
provide O
maintenance O
to O
the O
property, O
well O
are O
you O
personally O
providing O
the O
maintenance? O
If O
you're O
hiring O
others O
to O
do O
the O
maintenance, O
you're O
factoring O
that O
cost O
into O
the O
rent O
you're O
asking O
and O
it's O
actually O
the O
tenant O
paying O
for O
the O
maintenance. O
[SEP]
So O
if O
I O
may O
ask, O
your O
kids O
who O
are O
making O
$15 O
an O
hour, O
are O
they O
out O
on O
their O
own? O
Paying O
rent O
and O
everything O
else O
others O
pay? O
Again, O
I O
get O
that O
this O
is O
your O
kids, O
but O
who O
are O
the O
people O
they O
work O
with? O
If O
the O
car O
they O
drive O
needs O
an O
expensive O
repair, O
can O
they O
rely O
on O
you O
to O
get O
to O
work? O
Or O
is O
their O
job O
threatened? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
as O
for O
Walmart, O
You're O
right O
they O
do O
match O
6%, O
but O
if O
you O
want O
health O
insurance, O
it O
costs O
you O
over O
$200 O
a O
month, O
for O
a O
policy O
with O
a O
$2000 O
deductible O
and O
then O
80/20. O
So O
even O
if O
you O
are O
making O
$12 O
an O
hour O
about O
$2000 O
a O
month, O
$1600 O
after O
taxes O
(generous) O
then O
pay O
for O
insurance O
$1400 O
a O
month. O
Yeah O
if O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
food O
and O
gas O
and O
pay O
rent, O
you O
aren't O
donating O
a O
lot O
to O
your O
retirement O
fund. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
for O
advancement, O
no O
that O
is O
kind O
of O
the O
point, O
Companies O
work O
to O
keep O
pay O
as O
low O
as O
possible. O
People O
working O
retail O
just O
don't O
get O
yearly O
raises. O
When O
I O
got O
my O
first O
job O
in O
the O
late O
1970s O
I O
got O
min O
wage O
of O
$2.10, O
BUT O
the O
full O
time O
people O
got O
$2.80 O
to O
start. O
they O
got O
holiday O
bonuses O
and O
yearly O
raises. O
Some O
people O
were O
there O
for O
20 O
years, O
even O
at O
5 O
or O
10 O
cents O
a O
year O
they O
were O
making O
$5 O
an O
hour O
(over O
$22.00 O
in O
today's O
money.) O
Retail O
managers O
aren't O
making O
that O
in O
many O
stores O
today. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Hell O
my O
wife O
works O
for O
a O
world O
famous O
hospital. O
They O
are O
looking O
to O
pay O
$45k O
a O
year O
for O
positions O
that O
require O
a O
degree O
(at O
least O
you O
get O
good O
healthcare.) O
Raises O
have O
been O
averaging O
under O
3% O
a O
year, O
(inflation O
is O
higher) O
No O
matching O
for O
their O
retirement. O
And O
those O
are O
"good" O
jobs. O
[SEP]
So O
assuming O
you O
have O
a O
130k O
start, O
and O
you O
ll O
retire O
in O
40 O
years O
(I O
d O
assume O
less O
given O
your O
new O
salary, O
but O
lets O
use O
it O
as O
a O
nice O
round O
number) O
you O
d O
have O
to O
have O
a O
stable O
6% O
returns O
rate, O
and O
zero O
taxation O
on O
that O
income. O
Thats O
a O
REALLY O
sweet O
deal O
you O
got O
there, O
and O
I O
dont O
think O
people O
can O
replicate O
this O
easily. O
Where O
I O
live, O
5% O
is O
considered O
the O
top O
end O
of O
low O
risk O
investment, O
typically O
real O
estate O
in O
safe O
areas. O
Capital O
income O
tax O
takes O
a O
25% O
bite O
out O
of O
the O
returns, O
and O
of O
course O
you O
need O
to O
consider O
inflation, O
so O
to O
maintain O
the O
actual O
value O
you O
d O
need O
close O
to O
8-10% O
depending O
on O
how O
the O
new O
inflation O
settles. O

Congratulations O
on O
doing O
something O
few O
people O
can O
probably O
pull O
off, O
but O
as O
advice O
its O
a O
little O
bit O
unrealistic, O
esp. O
to O
a O
60 O
year O
old O
with O
2 O
kids. O
[SEP]
Who O
makes O
$300K O
a O
year? O
That's O
not O
even O
remotely O
possible O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
Americans. O
[SEP]
Are O
you O
saying O
that O
if O
you O
just O
keep O
it O
there O
it O
will O
grow O
to O
1.3 O
million? O
As O
someone O
who O
is O
64, O
you O
can't O
know O
that. O
But O
even O
if O
you O
are O
close, O
I O
commend O
you. O
But O
you O
have O
to O
understand O
that O
most O
teachers O
aren't O
making O
enough O
money O
to O
put O
what O
20k O
into O
a O
retirement O
account. O
(I O
am O
assuming O
that O
is O
what O
you O
would O
need O
to O
do O
to O
get O
it O
to O
grow O
to O
1.3 O
mill. O
by O
retirement. O
[SEP]
So O
at O
72, O
you O
need O
expensive O

Just O
willing O
to O
live O

die? O
It O
is O
just O
insurance. O
[SEP]
That's O
not O
the O
point. O
The O
point O
is O
that O
the O

is O
responsible O
for O
over O
half O
of O
American's O
income O
[SEP]
No O
of O
course O
not. O
But O
two O
points. O
1. O
Government O
employees O
keep O
their O
jobs O
by O
distributing O
government O
funds. O
2. O
If O
government O
is O
cut O
many O
government O
jobs O
could O
disappear. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Government O
workers O
have O
a O
vested O
interest O
in O
keeping O
government O
big, O
slow, O
ponderous O
and O
bloated. O
[SEP]

I O
am O
not O
saying O
the O
are O
dumb, O
lazy, O
ripping O
off O
the O
public O

is O
not O
useful. O
Just O

out O

with? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
One O
works O
at O

If O
the O
car O

can O

rely O

you O

get O
to O
work? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I've O
given O
my O

the O

So O
even O

$1600 O

The O
person O
you're O

not O
middle O

outright O
poor. O
That O

what O

far O
from O

I O
would O
agree O

you O
that O

an O

you O

I O
may O

on O
the O

that O
help O
takes O
or O
the O
mechanisms O

provide O
it. O

you O
can't O
call O
your O

it's O
not. O
[SEP]
Agreed O
[SEP]
Yes, O
they O

Almost O

The O

ticket O

sense O
because O
if O

are O

below O
the O

people O

willing O
to O
pay, O
scalpers O
can O
jump O
in, O
buy O
up O
the O

Scalpers O
are O
opportunists, O

they O
are O

But O
my O
point O
is O
that O
there O
are O
many O

just O
don't O
pay O
that O
much. O
People O
are O
a O
sickness O

a O

repair O
from O
being O
homeless O
and O
the O
real O
problem O
is O
that O
they O

take O
15% O
of O
what O
they O
make O

putting O
it O
away O

people O

up O
9x O

I O
think O
you're O
missing O
the O
point. O
The O
point O
is O
land O
you O
can O
live O
on O
is O
a O
scarce O
resource. O
We're O
not O
pioneers O
on O
a O
largely O
uninhabited O
frontier O
where O
land O
is O
not O
a O
scarce O
resource. O
Scarcity O
makes O
it O
valuable O
and O
thus O
costly. O
This O
costliness O
means O
that O
there O
is O
real O
value O
to O
being O
able O
to O
utilize O
property O
WITHOUT O
having O
to O
devote O
and O
put O
at O
risk O
your O
own O
resources O
up O
front O
necessary O
to O
make O
a O
purchase O
either O
because O
you O
don't O
have O
such O
resources O
or O
because O
you O
have O
better O
uses O
for O
them. O
THIS O
is O
a O
very O
real O
value O
which O
a O
landlord O
is O
providing O
to O
his O
tenants: O
He O
invested O
HIS O
resources O
up-front, O
and O
is O
putting O
HIS O
resources O
at O
risk O
so O
YOU O
don't O
have O
to. O
And O
the O
premium O
he's O
able O
to O
charge O
above O
his O
own O
costs O
is O
set O
by O
the O
value O
of O
his O
service O
determined O
by O
the O
competition O
between O
landlords O
and O
between O
potential O
tenants O
in O
a O
free O
market O
for O
real O
estate O
and O
rental O
units. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
think O
his O
service O
is O
of O
no O
value O
then O
you're O
free O
to O
not O
use O
it. O
Go O
out O
and O
buy O
the O
property O
rather O
than O
pay O
rent. O
If O
the O
reason O
you O
don't O
is O
because O
you O
*can't*... O
That O
just O
*proves* O
that O
he O
is O
contributing O
something O
of O
real O
value O
for O
his O
rental O
income. O

on O
mission O
best, O
but O

have O
their O
faves. O
Its O
a O
great O
donut O
and O
coffee O
town. O
Go O
to O

and O
see O
the O
elephant O

(probably O
look O
into O
booking O
that O
now). O
Walk O
the O
bluffs O
at O
wilder O
ranch. O
Walk O
the O

Watch O
surfing O
at O
steamer O
lane. O
Try O
surfing O
in O

Does O
anyone O
in O
your O
family O
skateboard? O
Buy O

Edit: O
tidepooling O
is O
a O
must O
do. O
There O
will O
be O
some O
huge O
tides O
that O
week, O
unfortunately O
the O
peak O
low O
is O
going O
to O
be O
after O
dark. O
Personally, O
id O
bundle O
up O
and O
go O
out O
with O
my O
flashlight O
in O
the O
pleasure O
point O
area O
to O
look O
around. O
You O
are O
looking O
at O
a O
-1.5 O
tide O
on O
Christmas O
around O
6:00pm. O
Stuff O
will O
probably O
pretty O
exposed O
around O
sunset. O
So O
you O
can O
see O
some O
of O
the O
creatures O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
daylight O
left. O

There's O
some O
great O
sight-seeing O
on O
Ocean O
Street. O
All O
kinds O
of O
homeless O
people O
on O
different O
types O
of O
drugs... O
I O
like O
driving O
down O
Ocean O
Street O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
people O
go O
to O
the O
zoo! O
[SEP]
Bring O
the O
Amex O
& O
you O
will O
love O
it. O
[SEP]
ice O
cream O
at O
marianne’s, O
also O
you O
could O
drive O
20 O
min O
to O
tour O
the O
martinelli’s O
factory O
[SEP]
The O
tree O
here O
is O
wonderful O
year O
round! O
[SEP]
Rio O
Del O
Mar O
beach O
is O
really O
long O
and O
nice O
to O
walk O
on, O
even O
when O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
people O
you O
don't O
feel O
crowded. O
You O
can O
also O
see O
the O
cement O
ship O
while O
there, O
you O
won't O
be O
disappointed.. O
[SEP]
Day O
trip O
to O
Big O
Sur. O
A O
gorgeous O
drive. O
Check O
out O
the O
three O
light O
houses. O
[SEP]
You O
might O
be O
coming O
a O
little O
too O
late O
for O
the O
actual O
Christmas O
boat O
parade, O
but O
the O
boats O
in O
the O
harbor O
are O
all O
decked O
out O
with O
Christmas O
lights O
that O
time O
of O
year, O
so O
an O
early O
evening O
walk O
from O
Frederick O
St. O
park O
down O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
harbor, O
or O
a O
tad O
further O
to O
the O
lighthouse, O
is O
always O
nice. O
[SEP]
Stop O
by O
moss O
landing O
and O
see O
the O
Sea O
Otters O
if O
you O
have O
time O
or O
are O
heading O
to O
Monterey O
at O
all. O
[SEP]
Mystery O

[SEP]
I’d O
look O
at O
the O
botanical O
garden, O
even O
tho O
it’s O
way O
offseasonn O
[SEP]
It O
is O
lovely O
but O
downtown O
Santa O
Cruz O
can O
be O
pretty O
seedy. O
I O
always O
steer O
friends O
toward O
hotels O
in O
Captiola. O

This O
is O
the O

I O
really O
like O
Lillian's O
for O
a O
nice O
dinner O
with O
great O
service. O
[SEP]
Great O
list. O
I'd O
add O
in: O
go O
see O
the O
butterflies O
at O
natural O
bridges. O
Watch O
and O
wave O
to O
the O
Christmas O
train O
(more O
fun O
to O
wave O
than O
ride, O
imo.) O
Walk O
around O
the O
harbor. O
Get O
treats O
on O
the O
wharf O
at O
marini's. O
If O
you O
have O
little O
ones, O
go O
to O
the O
entryway O
of O
the O
MAH O
(museum O
downtown) O
to O
see O
the O
Christmas O
model O
train O
display. O
Ride O
the O
carousel O
at O
the O
boardwalk. O
[SEP]
I O
second O
this. O
It's O
something O
that O
you O
won't O
forget O
and O
the O
perfect O
drive O
up O
Hi O
1, O
which O
is O
among O
the O
most O
beautiful O
road O
trips O
in O
the O
world. O
Afterwards O
drive O
up O
to O
Half O
Moon O
Bay O
for O
lunch. O
There O
are O
several O
nice O
restaurants O
and O
breweries. O
You're O
also O
not O
that O
far O
from O
Carmel/Big O
Sur O
for O
a O
day O
drive/hike O
over O
at O
Point O
Lobos O
Natural O
Reserve. O
Talk O
about O
stunning O
natural O
scenery. O
It's O
beyond O
amazing. O
Great O
call O
to O
do O
a O
California O
Christmas! O

If O
you’re O
going O
to O
check O
out O
the O

I O
recommend O
bringing O
binoculars. O
There O
are O
huge O
clusters O
of O
them O
up O
in O
the O
trees O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
boardwalk O
in O
natural O
bridges O
but O
its O
are O
hard O
to O
see O
the O

with O
the O

out. O

We O

[SEP]
They O
aren’t O
doing O
the O

at O
the O

this O

definitely O
go O

The O
parade O
is O
tonight O
but O
the O

are O
pretty O
all O
lit O
up! O

the O

is O
why O
people O
go O
there O
[SEP]
[SEP]
yes, O
it's O
inexpensive O
kinda-entertainment O
but O
hmm... O
[SEP]
Yes. O
The O

What O
are O
some O

is O
great O
but O
it O

Christmas O

[SEP]
We O
go O
to O
Seymour O
Center O
often O
with O
two O
toddler O
grandkids O
and O
a O

ticket, O
but O
it's O
a O
very O
limited O
shadow O
of O
Monterey O

.. O
skip O
Seymour O
Center O
and O
spend O
a O
day O
in O
the O
real O

in O
Monterey, O
it's O
world O
class. O
[SEP]
They O

ups, O
right O
now O
it’s O
a O

Hanloh O
[SEP]
And O
downtown O

is O
retuning O
this O

Big O

[SEP]
Oh O
shit… O
got O
Zelda’s O
and O
crows O

mixed O
up O
in O
my O

lol O
[SEP]
They O
have O
little O
spaces O
to O
rent O
a O
fire O
pit O
overlooking O
the O
beach, O
maybe O
instead O
of O
the O
rink. O
Personally, O
I'd O
just O
go O
to O
a O
beach O
with O
bonfire O
pits O
and O
have O
a O
bonfire, O
but O
if O
you O
want O
to O
avoid O
smelling O
like O
a O
bonfire, O
this O
would O
work. O
[SEP]
And O
got O
smacked O
back O
to O
E O
Lake. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
no O

That’s O

even O
if O

honestly O
I O

it'll O

But O
I O
have O
a O
question, O
even O
if O
you O
wear O
eye O
protection O
can O
it O
still O
damage O
your O
eyes O
due O
to O
long O
exposure O
even O
if O
you're O
wearing O
it? O
Thank O
you. O
[SEP]
If O
you're O
wearing O
the O
right O
eye O
protection O
at O
the O
proper O
time, O
and O
wearing O
it O
correctly, O
your O
eyes O
will O
be O
fine, O
even O
with O
long O
term O
exposure O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Your O
respiratory O
system O
is O
much O
less O
forgiving, O
wear O
a O
good O
respirator O
and O
check O
your O
filters O
often O
[SEP]
Put O
your O
safety O
first O
, O
think O
of O
the O
long O
haul O
…. O
The O
ones O
that O
last O
in O
this O
game O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
protect O
themselves O
and O
work O
smart O
. O
Treat O
your O
body O
like O
shit O
and O
it O
will O
break O
down O
. O
Yea O
it’s O
not O
the O
safest O
trade O
but O
there’s O
also O
a O
lot O
of O
idiots O
who O
skip O
safety O
and O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
it. O
[SEP]
Use O
the O
proper O
shade O
number O
for O
what O
you're O
doing. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
saw O
guys O
using O
number O
8 O
shades O
while O
stick O
welding O
cuz O
"they O
couldn't O
see O
the O
pool" O
fucking O
blinding O
when O
I O
tried O
their O
hood. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
We O
are O
also O
using O
glass. O
Auto O
seems O
to O
be O
"lighter" O
than O
glass O
I O
was O
11 O
with O
glass O
and O
auto O
I O
was O
12. O
Stick O
at O
125amps. O
[SEP]
The O
damage O
from O
welding O
comes O
from O
UV O
exposure. O
Every O
welding O
hood O
will O
block O
it O
completely O
and O
even O
clear O
polycarbonate O
lenses O
will O
block O
over O
99%, O
so O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
ALWAYS O
be O
wearing O
clear O
safeties O
in O
a O
shop O
environment, O
even O
under O
a O
welding O
hood, O
in O
case O
you O
accidentally O
get O
flashed. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
someone O
else O
said, O
the O
much O
much O
more O
significant O
long O
term O
exposure O
risk O
is O
respiratory. O
[SEP]
I O
believe O
that O
it O
can. O
I O
have O
been O
welding O
for O
decades, O
and O
I O
always O
use O
the O
darkest O
shade O
available, O
usually O
a O
12. O
But O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
given O
day, O
I O
still O
feel O
eyestrain O
and O
irritation O
on O
occasion. O
I O
also O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
floaters, O
which O
I O
feel O
developed O
over O
time O
while O
welding. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also O
you O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
about O
the O
arc O
flash O
reflecting O
off O
stuff O
behind O
you O
and O
coming O
in O
from O
the O
back O
of O
the O
helmet. O
And O
then O
there O
are O
the O
inevitable O
unintentional O
arc O
strikes O
where O
you O
end O
up O
getting O
flashed O
by O
someone O
else. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
are O
super O
careful O
and O
use O
the O
proper O
PPE O
you O
will O
likely O
be O
OK, O
but O
the O
potential O
is O
still O
there O
and O
you O
should O
be O
aware O
of O
that. O
[SEP]
[deleted] O
[SEP]
Yes O
but O
not O
the O
way O
you O
think. O
Think O
like O
a O
lifetime O
of O
reading O
eye O
strain. O
Super O
focused O
on O
minute O
detailed O
things O
[SEP]
The O
long-term O
effects O
of O
welding O
very O
very O
close O
it's O
tough O
on O
the O
eyes O
seriously O
have O
you O
seen O
any O
old O
welders O
you O
don't O
have O
glasses O
on O
when O
you O
focus O
your O
muscles O
that O
close O
to O
your O
face O
all O
the O
time O
and O
puts O
a O
lot O
of O
strain O
on O
them O
so O
you O
have O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
that O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
shielding O
glass O
keeping O
your O
eyes O
safe O
yeah O
you'll O
be O
fine O
[SEP]
You O
have O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
are O
on O
the O
right O
shade O
[SEP]
You’ll O
get O
arc O
flash… O
a O
lot. O
But O
that’s O
just O
part O
of O
the O
trade. O
However O
(correct O
me O
if O
I’m O
wrong), O
some O
if O
not O
most O
safety O
glasses O
by O
them O
selves O
have O
a O
slight O
amount O
of O
UV O
protection. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
As O
for O
daily O
under O
the O
hood, O
there’s O
different O
shade O
levels O
and O
it’s O
all O
up O
to O
preference O
from O
there. O
[SEP]
Everything O
in O
life O
will O
kill O
you. O
Happy O
Friday!! O
[SEP]
Even O
with O
protection O
if O
you O
don’t O
have O
a O
full O
headgear O
you O
can O
get O
some O
exposure O
from O
other O
welders O
in O
the O
shop. O
Depends O
on O
how O
many O
and O
if O
there O
are O
screens O
available. O
I O
just O
weld O
at O
home O
so O
not O
an O
issue O
for O
me O
but O
an O
associate O
is O
a O
production O
welder O
and O
he O
occasionally O
gets O
some O
exposure O
from O
others. O
Also O
you O
need O
to O
set O
your O
hood O
setting O
correct O
or O
have O
the O
correct O
fixed O
lens O
for O
the O
process O
you O
are O
using. O
(There’s O
plenty O
on O
the O
internet O
to O
advise O
lens O
shade O
or O
equivalent O
for O
different O
processes) O
happy O
welding! O
[SEP]
The O
hardest O
thing O
on O
a O
welders O
eyes O
are O
the O
women. O
You O
meet O
Suzie O
Rotten O
Crotch O
in O
a O
bar O
at O
night. O
She O
is O
a O

beauty O
queen. O
However O
the O
next O
morning O
when O
you O
wake O
up O
and O
she O
is O
laying O
next O
to O
you O
your O
thinking O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
queen O
I O
left O
with O
last O
night. O
Some O
of O
these O
gals O
can O
be O
extremely O
hard O
on O
the O
eyes. O

Going O

If O

it O

[SEP]
Not O
really, O
but O
yes. O
Any O
exposure O
to O
UV O
light O
is O
damaging. O
Using O
the O
proper O
shade O
will O
just O
delay O
the O
inevitable. O
The O
real O
question O
is O
if O
you O
want O
to O

blind O
at O
60 O

90. O
[SEP]
Depends O
on O
the O

[SEP]
Get O

use O
at O

a O

still O
developed O
night O

I O

Hello! O
Just O
keep O
in O
mind, O
the O
light O
you O
are O
protecting O
from, O
is O
uv O
light, O
so O
it O
is O
invisible, O
is O
not O
the O
glare O
you O
can O
see O
when O
welding. O
[SEP]
That O
being O
said, O
if O
your O
are O
next O
to O
other O
people O
welding, O
let's O
say O
in O
a O
classroom, O
even O
if O
you O
are O
not O
welding O
remember O
that O
that O
light O
still O
bounces O
in O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
room, O
so O
if O
you O
think O
that O
as O
long O
you O
are O
not O
staring O
at O
the O
visible O
glare O
your O
are O
ok, O
you'd O
be O
wrong, O
all O
the O
people O
in O
the O
room O
will O
be O
the O
same O
exposed O
to O
a O
light O
that O
behaves O
like O
light O
but O
you O
cannot O
see. O
[SEP]
Enjoy O
your O
journey!!! O
[SEP]
Jeez! O
Reading O
some O

here O
is O
making O
me O

I O
use O
shade O
12 O
(with B-Appearance
blue I-Appearance
eyes) I-Appearance
at O
all O
times, O
unless O
using O
Flux O
core, O
then O
it's O
shade O
13. O
My O
eyes O
are O
fine, O
after O
17 O
years, O
even O
though O
my O
whole O
family O
wears O
glasses. O
My O
breathing O
was O
always O
bad O
because O
of O
asthma, O
but O
since O
I O
started O
wearing O
a O
respirator O
at O
ALL O
TIMES O
it's O
been O
much O
better! O
Always O
care O
about O
your O
lungs! O
Eyes O
have O
an O
easy O
crutch O
(glasses).....you O
lungs O
not O
so O
much. O

My O
throat O
and O
nose O
feels O
kind O
of O
soar O
after O
working O
at O
the O
factory O
for O
12h. O
We O
have O
air O
filtered O
welding O
masks.. O
it's O
all O
the O
anti O
spatter O
spray O
fumes O
saturating O
the O
air.. O
the O
ventilation O
system O
can't O
keep O
up. O
Feels O
like O
I O
need O
to O
wear O
a O
respirator O
in O
there O
even O
when O
I'm O
not O
welding. O
[SEP]
After O
20 O
years O
in O
the O
industry O
my O
eye O
are O
fine. O
I O
have O
only O
had O
arc O
flash O
3 O
times. O
It's O
from O
when O
someone O
welds O
to O
close O
behind O
you. O
The O
light O
will O
reflect O
off O
the O
inside O
of O
your O
glasses O
and O
into O
your O
eye. O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
every O
shop O
has O
that O
guy O
who O
practically O
abuses O
himself O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
boss. O
"I O
don't O
have O
a O
choice, O
I O
just O
gotta O
get O
it O
done" O
he O
says O
before O
returning O
to O
cutting O
steel O
without O
gloves O
or O
glasses O
on. O
It O
takes O
him O
a O
moment O
to O
do O
anything O
near O
the O
floor O
because O
his O
knees O
are O
so O
fucked O
he O
can't O
bend O
or O
squat O
and O
it's O
always O
questionable O
if O
he's O
gonna O
make O
it O
back O
up... O
[SEP]
[SEP]
That O
guy O
keeps O
me O
reminded O
that O
the O
boss O
is O
less O
important O
to O
me O
than O
myself. O
Fuck O
anyone O
who O
wants O
me O
to O
become O
disabled O
to O
meet O
some O
bottom O

figure O
written O

Shade O
8 O

shouldn’t O
be O
in O
the O
same O
sentence O
[SEP]
Everyone's O
eyes O
process O
light O
differently. O
So O
its O
possible O
that O
he O
was O
just O
less O
sensitive O
to O
light O
than O
most O
people. O
[SEP]
Not O
to O

some O

some O

fragments O
of O

at O
your O

[SEP]
I O
feel O
like O
the O

strain O
might O
be O
caused O
from O
focusing O
on O
one O
point O
for O
too O
long, O
and O
possibly O
using O
too O
dark O
of O
a O

making O
it O
harder O

Though O
that O
depends O
on O
what O

what O

you O

a O

would O

after O

Holy O
shit. O
I O
can’t O
imagine O
welding O
with O
a O
shade O
lower O
than O
11, O
and O
honestly O
even O
11 O
was O
too O
bright. O
I O
typically O
weld O
with O
my O
lens O
on O
13 O
but O
sometimes O
I’ll O
drop O
to O
12 O
if O
my O
lens O
is O
needing O

and O
I O
just O
wanna O
weld O
something O
small O
real O
quick. O
[SEP]
Do O
you O

under O

That’s O

about O
your O

an O

Always O
bare O
minimum O
standards. O
[SEP]
I O
welded O
for O
8 O
months O
before O
moving O
into O
the O
office. O
That’s O
all O
I O
the O
time O
I O
needed O
to O
tell O
what O
welding O
would O
do O
to O
me O
after O
10 O

It’s O
a O
fun O

health O

Okay O

what O

I O

If O

you O

at O

I’m O

me. O
I O
don’t O
want O
all O
my O

to O
also O
show O
up O
on O
my O

only O
texts, O

and O

I O
don’t O
understand O
if O
it’s O
possible O
to O
fix O
though. O
The O
help O
section O
on O
garmin.com O
makes O
it O
sound O
like O
you O
have O
to O
have O
notifications O
disabled O
on O
your O

for O
a O
specific O
app O
to O
ensure O
it O
doesn’t O
show O
up O

Surely O
that O

Dear O

I O

working…but O
very O
slow. O
Therefore O
my O
question: O
how O
long O
dit O
it O
take O
to O
work? O
Suddenly O
or O
slow? O
[SEP]
Thanks O
in O

for O

2 O
to O
6 O

[SEP]
25mg O
currently. O
Third O

I O
had O
windows O

where O
that O
heavy O
cloud O
was O

That O
feeling O
became O
more O
frequent O
as O
the O
days O
went O

Zoloft. O
[SEP]
What O
dosage O
are O
you O
on? O
I'm O
nearly O
7 O
weeks O
into O
50mg, O
can't O
tell O
if O
it's O
working O
or O
not O
😅 O
[SEP]
I've O
been O
on O
it O
since O
August O
as O
well. O
It O
has O
worked... O
but O
by O
like O
10%. O
I'll O
take O
whatever O
improvement O
I O
get O
though. O
[SEP]
9 O
weeks O
before O
first O
improvements. O
[SEP]
About O
3-4 O
weeks O
for O
me. O
I O
moved O
up O
doses O
to O
100mg O
within O
3 O
weeks O
though O
because O
I O
was O
dealing O
with O
severe O
panic O
disorder. O
Most O
people O
don’t O
up O
their O
dose O
as O
quickly O
as O
I O
did. O
[SEP]
I O
got O
immediate O
calming O
effect. O
And O
that’s O
pretty O
much O
stayed O
with O
me O
since O
day O
1. O
I O
on O
and O
off O
feel O
happier O
and O
I’m O
not O
snapping O
at O
people O

call O

on O
anyone O
since O
I O

What O
dose? O
[SEP]
My O
psychiatrist O
started O
me O
at O
50mg O
four O
days O
ago, O
and O
wants O
me O
to O
take O
100mg O
from O
the O
second O
week O
forward. O
I'm O
about O
upping O
the O
dosage O
so O
quickly. O
What O
should O
I O
expect? O
[SEP]
The O
most O
side O
effects O
I’ve O
had O
has O
been O
being O
a O
little O
shaky. O
I O
also O
had O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
a O
“floaty” O
feeling O
right O
after O
I O
upped O
the O
dose. O
I O
did O
a O
week O
at O
50mg O
and O
then O
a O
week O
at O
75mg O
before O
moving O
to O
100 O
though. O
I O
didn’t O
go O
straight O
from O
50 O
to O
100. O
You O
could O
try O
doing O
75 O
for O
a O
few O
days O
first. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
replying. O
My O
most O
major O
side O

has O
been O
insomnia. O
I O

That’s O
so O
rough. O
I O

I B-Health
had I-Health
awful I-Health
insomnia I-Health
for I-Health
a I-Health
while I-Health
too I-Health
but O
for O

it B-Health
was I-Health
because I-Health
of I-Health
my I-Health
panic I-Health
disorder I-Health
and I-Health
OCD I-Health
flare I-Health
up I-Health
since O
I B-Health
was I-Health
having I-Health
insomnia I-Health
before I-Health
getting I-Health
on I-Health
Zoloft. I-Health
Once O
Zoloft O
started O
kicking O
in O
it O
got O
better. O
I O
know O
insomnia O
is O
a O
common O

it’ll O
clear O

What O
what O
[SEP]
I O
studied O
cognitive O

during O
the O
summer, O
why? O
[SEP]
How O
much O
and O
how O
do O
you O
know O
you’re O
te O

[SEP]
Are O
you O
doubting O
me?? O
Jk O
I O
doubted O
myself O
too O
for O
some O
time. O
Not O
for O
te-fi O
because O
I O
think O
that’s O
very O
obvious O
to O
everyone, O
but O
I O
couldn’t O
decide O
between O
estj/entj. O
90% O
of O
the O
time O
I O
really O
see O
the O
Ni-Se O
but O
then O
I’ll O
read O
something O
about O
Si O
to O
which O
I O
can O
relate O
to O
(rarely O
ever O
Ne O
but O
ig O
it O
makes O
sense O
cuz O
it O
would O
be O
tert?). O
However O
every O
time O
I O
read O
estj O
vs O
entj O
descriptions O
I O
always O
relate O
to O
the O
entj O
and O
rarely O
ever O
anything O
about O
the O
estj. O
I O
also O
have O
a O
dad O
with O
pretty O
high O
Si O
so O
I O
can O
really O
see O
how O
different O
we O
are. O
I O
try O
to O
study O
and O
understand O
better O
cognitive O
functions O
and O
stacks O
every O
day O
if O
I O
can, O
whenever O
I O
watch O
movies/read O
books O
I O
always O
try O
to O
notice O
what O
functions O
characters O
use, O
then O
check O
online O
and O
read O
the O
comments O
as O
a O
way O
of O
”training O
the O
eye”. O
I O
have O
yet O
a O
lot O
to O
learn, O
though O
I O
believe O
I O
know O
enough O
to O
type O
myself O
(I O
have O
been O
called O
overconfident O
a O
few O
times O
tho O
so O
idk O
lmao). O
That O
doesn’t O
really O
answer O
your O
question O
but O
I O
don’t O
suppose O
you O
want O
me O
to O
describe O
everything O
I O
know O
about O
each O
cognitive O
function, O
right? O
[SEP]
Yes O
maybe O
I O
do O
hahaha! O
Also O
tell O
me O
about O
si O
blindness O
I O
have O
studied O
this O
and O
very O
seriously O
for O
3 O
years. O
[SEP]
Well O
if O
you O
have O
then O
you O
should O
explain O
better O
what O
you O
mean O
bc O
I O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
it O
until O
you O
mentioned O
it O
just O
now. O
Are O
you O
talking O
about O
PoLR? O
[SEP]
I O
am. O
I O
want O
you O
to O
explain O
it O
that O
confirms O
things O
more. O
[SEP]
Right.. O
well O
like O
I O
said O
I O
don’t O
know O
anything O
about O
it O
yet O
so O
ig O
I O
can’t O
do O
that O
[SEP]
So O
maybe O
I O
should O
just O
type O
you O
afresh. O
It O
will O
help O
you O
out O
and O
you’d O
learn O
a O
lot. O
If O
you’re O
really O
what O
you O
think O
it O
will O
not O
hert O
you, O
if O
you’re O
not O
that O
will O
completely O
retype O
you. O
[SEP]
Sure O
I O
have O
no O
problem O
with O
that, O
but O
I O
am O
wondering O
why O
you’re O
having O
such O
a O
hard O
time O
answering O
my O
question. O
Also O
why O
are O
you O
so O
interested O
in O
helping O
me? O
[SEP]
Because O
I O
want O
to O
help O
people O
find O

invited O
me O

I O

[SEP]
Back O
in O
July O
I O
was O
last O
minute O
invited O
to O
come O
live O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends, O
5 O
people O
in O
a O
4 O
bedroom O
because O
rent O
was O
too O
high. O
I O
agreed O
being O
told O
I O
would O
have O
a O
ground O
level O
room O
and O
since O
I O
have O
a O
parrot O
the O
sunlight O
is O
MUCH O
needed. O
Well O
the O
week O
before O
I O
moved O
my O
belongings O
one O
of O
the O
original O
housemates O
decided O
she O
(26f) B-Age_Gender
was O
moving O
out O
and O
they O
filled O
the O
spot O
same O
day. O
Problem O
is O
the O
new O
person O
E O
(25m) B-Age_Gender
got O
the O
room O
I O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
and O
I O
was O
assigned O
the O
corner O
basement O
room. O
Apparently O
E O
and O
one O
of O
the O
housemates O
(D) O
are O
exes O
and O
D's O
current O
partner O
(F) B-Gender
does O
not O

them O
on O
the O

is O
ok?) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
have O
3 O
massive O
artificial O
lights O
now O
for O
my O

because O
this O
room O
is O
so O
far O
underground O
there O
is O
no O
sunlight O
at O
all O
:(. O
I O
have O
to O
play O
bird O
videos O
instead O
of O
the O
birdfeeder O
I O
wanted O
to O
set O
up O
and O
I O
just O
feel O
so O
bad O
for O
him O
because O
he's O
in O
this O
dark O
basement O
alone. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
group O
doesn't O
really O
seem O
to O
care O
and O
have O
explained O
to O
me O
that O
it's O
basically O
tough O
shit O
and O
drop O
it. O
I O
have, O
but O
the O
whole O
reason O
I O
chose O
to O
move O
here O
was O
because O
I O
was O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
I O
would O
have O
a O
good O
set O
up O
for O
my O
parrot. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
I O
feel O
that O
I O
sound O
unreasonable O
and O
ungrateful O
yea? O
Well O
E O
is O
never O
even O
home. O
80% O
of O
the O
time O
the O
room O
is O
empty, O
he O
spends O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
at O
work O
and O
at O
his O
partners O
house O
and O
stays O
there O
overnight O
often. O
I O
get O
to O
look O
at O
this O
beautifully O
bright O
empty O
room O
every O
day. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
really O
appreciative O
about O
being O
asked O
to O
move O
in O
but O
I O
am O
kinda O
mad O
that O
I O
was O
tossed O
aside O
like O
that. O
How O
should O
I O
proceed? O
I O
know O
I O
should O
just O
drop O
it O
but O
I O
keep O
feeling O
slighted O
about O
it. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Also O
the O
lot O
of O
them O
failed O
to O
mention O
they O
aren't O
extending O
the O
lease O
and O
everyone O
else O
already O
has O
plans O
to O
move O
somewhere O
specific O
and O
I O
had O
to O
find O
out O
through O
a O
mutual O
friend. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
TLDR: O
Roommates O
invited O
me O
to O
live O
with O

and O
changed O
the O
plans O

I O

my O

😭😭 O
[SEP]
Keep O
going O
mann O
70days O
you're O
a O

i O
just O

now O
and O
i O
totally O
regret O
it O
so O
don't O
fell O
for O

it's O
a O
life O
killerrrr O
[SEP]
Your O
balls O
hurting O
is O
called O
having O
blue O
balls. O
That O
happens O
when O
fluids O
(not O
semen, O
that's O
not O
stored O
in O
the O
balls) O
accumulate O
in O
your O
balls O
from O
being O
aroused O
and O
not O
releasing. O
It O
creates O
a O
pressure O
that O
hurts. O
Probably O
happened O
because O
you O
watched O
porn. O
Now O
you O
know O
why O
you O
shouldn't O
do O
that. O
The O
pain O
might O
go O
away O
on O
its O
own O
but O
I O
heard O
that O
applying O
cold O
helps, O
or O
doing O
squats O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
weight O
(warm O
your O
legs O
up O
first). O
Hope O
you O
manage. O
Also, O
motivation O
is O
great O
and O
makes O
things O
easier O
but O
real O
strength O
comes O
from O
discipline, O
i.e. O
being O
able O
to O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
even O
if O
you O
don't O
feel O
like O
it. O
So O
even O
if O
you O
release O
and O
don't O
feel O
motivated O
don't O
take O
that O
as O
an O
excuse O
to O
not O
do O
the O
work. O
Accept O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
just O
won't O
be O
as O
easy. O
Hope O
you O
manage O
to O
hang O
on O
and O
pass O
your O
exams! O

Hiya O
so O
idk O
if O
it’s O
too O
late O
for O
me O
to O
take O
action O
but O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
I O
attended O
a O
friends O
birthday O
party O
at O
a O
bar/club. O
[SEP]
an O
incident O
occurred O
in O
which O
my O
friend O
(who O
I O
was O
living O
with O
at O
the O
time) O
had O
lost O
her O
bag O
in O
the O
bar O
after O
becoming O
incredibly O
intoxicated, O
because O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
night O
there O
was O
cctv O
footage O
of O
me O
carrying O
my O
friends O
bag O
for O
her O
to O
our O
table O
and O
I B-Race_Nationality
was I-Race_Nationality
the I-Race_Nationality
only I-Race_Nationality
coloured I-Race_Nationality
individual I-Race_Nationality
with O
the O
group O
the O
bouncers O
had O
assumed O
that O
I O
was O
a O
thief O
and O
proceeded O
to O
hold O
be O
in O
their O
back O
rooms O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
where O
3 O
large O
men O
proceeded O
to O
intimate O
me O
insisting O
that O
it O
was O
not O
a O
racially O
profiled O
incident O
because O
the O
manager O
was O
black, O
as O
I O
didn’t O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on O
and O
couldn’t O
provide O
them O
with O
any O
information O
since O
I O
hadn’t O
stolen O
anything O
they O
proceeded O
to O
calm O
that O
they O
had O
thirty O
cctv O
footage O
of O
me O
looking O
through O
my O
friends O
bags O
and O
taking O
things O
however O
when O
I O
asked O
to O
be O
shown O
the O
footage O
it O
could O
not O
be O
provided O
I O
was O
eventually O
let O
go O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Unbeknownst O
to O
me O
while O
I O
was O
being O
held O
by O
security, O
there O
was O
another O
bouncer O
who O
had O
gone O
to O
my O
friend O
(who O
had O
lost O
her O
bag) O
and O
told O
her O
that O
he O
thought O
that O
I O
had O
mental O
health O
issues, O
that O
I O
was O
lying O
to O
her O
and O
that O
she O
should O
find O
better O
friends. O
So O
when O
I O
was O
eventually O
released O
and O
we O
all O
got O
in O
our O
lift O
to O
go O
home O
she O
brutally O
attacked O
me O
in O
the O
car O
ripping O
out O
clumps O
of O
my O
hair O
[SEP]
[SEP]
In O
the O
aftermath O
the O
next O
day O
she O
threw O
all O
of O
my O
things O
outside O
into O
the O
rain O
and O
filled O
my O
bags O
with O
her O
dogs O
poop O
before O
spitting O
on O
my O
things O
resulting O
in O
damages O
to O
various O
expensive O
pieces O
of O
technology O
and O
I O
had O
most O
of O
my O
clothing O
ruined O
by O
the O
damp, O
She O
made O
various O
TikTok’s O
that O
she O
eventually O
took O
down O
boasting O
about O
the O
way O
she O
had O
attacked O
me O
and O
she O
has O
crippled O
my O
social O
life O
as O
she O
has O
told O
anyone O
that O
will O
listen O
that O
I’m O
not O
a O
good O
person O
and O
that O
I’m O
a O
thief O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
i O
was O
all O
a O
misunderstanding O
and O
her O
bad O
was O
found O
in O
the O
end O
with O
everything O
still O
in O
it O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
life O
now O
is O
a O
shell O
of O
what O
I O
used O
to O
be, O
I O
rally O
go O
out O
because O
In O
my O
small O
town O
I O
am O
almost O
always O
met O
with O
dirty O
looks O
of O
comments O
from O
individuals O
who O
believe O
the O
false O
accusations O
made O
against O
me O
and O
I O
was O
just O
hoping O
that O
someone O
on O
this O
platform O
might O
know O
of O
something O
I O
can O
do O
to O
Clear O
my O
name O

So O
you’ve O
had O
numerous O
crimes O
committed O
against O
you O
here O
that O
you O
should O
go O
to O
the O
police O
about. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
first O
is O
false O
imprisonment. O
The O
line O
between O
citizens O
arrest O
and O
false O
imprisonment O
is O
that O
obviously O
debatable O
but O
they’ve O
gone O
far O
over O
it O
in O
this O
case O
because: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
- O
The O
crime O
is O
not O
serious. O
[SEP]
- O
There O
is O
little O
evidence O
you O
did O
it. O
You O
didn’t O
have O
the O
bag O
on O
you. O
[SEP]
- O
They O
held O
you O
for O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half. O
You’re O
only O
supposed O
to O
hold O
someone O
until O
the O
police O
arrive. O
Obviously O
the O
police O
would O
have O
arrived O
much O
sooner O
than O
that O
or O
the O
police O
would O
have O
told O
them O
to O
let O
you O
go. O
Clearly O
they O
didn’t O
even O
ring O
the O
police O
which O
means O
it O
doesn’t O
count O
as O
a O
citizens O
arrest, O
just O
false O
imprisonment. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
should O
go O
to O
the O
police O
over O
this. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
also O
put O
in O
a O
civil O
claim O
for O
damages O
against O
the O
company O
which O
could O
give O
you O
significant O
compensation. O
You’ll O
probably O
need O
a O
lawyer O
to O
pursue O
a O
civil O
claim O
but O
may O
be O
able O
to O
get O
no O
win O
no O
fee. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
also O
get O
their O
security O
licences O
taken O
away. O
https://www.gov.uk/report-security-staff-or-companies O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Secondly O
assault. O
You O
roommate O
physically O
assaulted O
you. O
This O
is O
a O
crime. O
Go O
to O
the O
police O
and O
present O
whatever O
evidence O
you O
have. O
If O
you O
saved O
her O
TikToks O
admitting O
it O
it O
will O
be O
an O
open O
and O
shut O
case O
(though O
will O
still O
take O
a O
long O
time.) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Thirdly, O
damaging O
your O
stuff. O
This O
is O
criminal O
damage. O
Again O
go O
to O
the O
police O
with O
your O
evidence. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Lastly O
the O
reputational O
damage. O
You O
do O
have O
a O
case O
that O
you’ve O
been O
lied O
about O
and O
had O
your O
reputation O
damage O
however O
pursing O
such O
a O
case O
through O
the O
Courts O
would O
be O
very O
expensive O
for O
you O
and O
may O
be O
very O
difficult. O
My O
advice O
would O
be O
that O
once O
you O
go O
to O
the O
police O
you O
go O
on O
social O
media O
and O
tell O
your O
side O
of O
the O
story O
publicly. O
As O
long O
as O
you O
tell O
the O
truth O
there O
should O
be O
no O
legal O
problems O
for O
you O
in O
doing O
this. O
Name O
the O
people O
involved, O
name O
and O
shame O
the O
companies. O
Lots O
of O
people O
will O
believe O
you O
and O
sympathise O
with O
you. O
I O
instantly O
believed O
you. O
The O
higher O
ups O
at O
the O
company O
will O
probably O
investigate. O
Your O
roommate O
may O
attack O
you O
again O
but O
you O
will O
have O
defenders O
on O
your O
side O
now O
and O
she’s O
actually O
likely O
to O
say O
something O
that O
incriminates O
her O
again. O

Hope O
that O

Current O
state O
of O
wrestling O
magazines O
(Pro O
Wrestling O
Illustrated O
etc.)? O
[SEP]
As O
a O
kid O
I B-Interests
was I-Interests
a I-Interests
big I-Interests
fan I-Interests
of I-Interests
PWI I-Interests
and I-Interests
their I-Interests
family I-Interests
of I-Interests
magazines, I-Interests
and O
would O
also O
occasionally O
end O
up O
with O
one O
from O
the O
George O
Napolitano O
publications O
(theirs O
were O
kind O
of O
a O
sloppier, O
pulpier O
version O
of O
the O
Apter O
mags). O
It O
was O
really O
common O
to O
see O
them O
at O
grocery O
store O
or O
drugstore O
newsstands, O
all-ages O
bookstores, O
etc. O
back O
in O
the O
late O
'80s O
and O
early O
'90s. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
know O
that O
Pro O
Wrestling O
Illustrated O
still O
exists, O
because O
the O
PWI O
500 O
gets O
talked O
up O
on O
social O
media O
every O
year O
(if O
nothing O
else) O
but O
it's O
been O
a O
few O
years O
since O
I've O
actually O
seen O
one O
at O
a O
store O
(I O
think O
Walgreens O
was O
the O
last O
one?) O
I O
know O
it's O
not O
novel O
to O
say O
that O
print O
media's O
been O
in O
steep O
decline O
for O
awhile, O
so O
it's O
impressive O
that O
PWI O
is O
still O
around O
at O
all, O
but O
I O
was O
curious O
and O
figured O
someone O
on O
here O
probably O
still O
bought/read O
them O
semi-regularly. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
guess O
my O
main O
questions O
are: O
[SEP]
[SEP]
1. O
Is O
PWI O
the O
last O
one O
standing, O
or O
do O
they O
still O
publish O
other O
titles? O
As O
mentioned, O
I've O
seen O
PWI O
for O
sale O
at O
stores O
a O
few O
times O
in O
recent O
years, O
but O
I O
can't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
saw O
any O
other O
wrestling O
magazine. O
From O
the O
"Apter O
mags" O
family O
or O
otherwise. O
[SEP]
2. O
Do O
they O
still O
more O
or O
less O
try O
to O
keep O
kayfabe O
in O
their O
stories? O
I O
know O
on O
one O
hand O
that O
might O
seem O
foolish O
in O
the O
internet O
age, O
when O
there's O
probably O
no O
full-on O
"marks" O
left O
of O
any O
age, O
but O
if O
they O
can't O
compete O
with O
the O
internet O
(online O
dirtsheets O
included) O
in O
terms O
of O
news O
and O
up-to-the-minute O
commentary, O
I O
can O
see O
how O
they O
might O
decide O
to O
just O
pick O
a O
lane O
and O
keep O
up O
a O
winking O
suspension O
of O
disbelief. O

So O
I O
recently O
got O
the O
PWI O
500 O
magazine O
and O
I O
was O
rather O
happy O
with O
my O
purchase. O
I O
don’t O
know O
of O
other O
magazines O
really. O
But O
I O
liked O
the O
product O
enough O
that O
I O
bought O
a O
subscription. O

I O
live O

was O

his O
dad O
my O
great O

as O
kid O
reading O
the O
magazines O

stuff. O
It O
did O
still O
present O
itself O
as O
a O
kayfabe O
magazine. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
the O
big O
reason O
for O
me O
I O
got O
it O
to O
connect O
with O
an O
old O

fan. O
And O
it O
worked. O
We’re O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O

[SEP]
Hi, O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I B-Location
lived I-Location
in I-Location
Missouri I-Location
some B-Time
time I-Time
ago I-Time
and O
made O
my O
internet O
payments O
directly O
through O
the O
landlord O
included O
in O
Rent O
since O
the O
internet O
was O
a O
bundle O
they O
had O
with O
ATT. O
Though O
the O
online O
account O
had O
my O
email O
and O
name, O
it O
always O
showed O
$0 O
and O
no O
usage O
as O
that O
was O
reported O
to O
my O
landlord. O
When O
I O
moved O
out, O
I O
asked O
my O
landlord O
if O
I O
was O
responsible O
for O
returning O
the O
equipment, O
or O
I O
leave O
it O
in O
the O
apartment O
for O
the O
next O
person, O
and O
they O
told O
me O
to O
leave O
it O
and O
they'll O
take O
care O
of O
it. O
I O
got O
notification O
months O
later O
from O
ATT O
saying O
that O
I O
didn't O
return O
my O
equipment. O
I O
called O
the O
landlord, O
they O
were O
going O
to O
return. O
Never O
did, O
so O
I O
got O
ATT O
sent O
the O
debt O
to O
a O
debt O
collection O
agency. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
TBH O
I O
have O
the O
money O
to O
pay O
this O
bill O
($\~170), O
but O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
debts O
that O
are O
not O
mine, O
since O
I O
was O
going O
to O
return O
the O
equipment O
initially. O
The O
apartment O
contract O
clearly O
stated O
that O
internet O
is O
through O
them, O
but O
I O
can O
be O
held O
liable O

he O
doesn't O
even O
talk O

that O
in O

we O

Hi. O
I’m O
like O
your O
fiancé O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
being O
interviewed. O
I O
can O
write O
a O
killer O
resume O
and O
cover O
letter, O
so O
I O
usually O
land O
an O
interview, O
but O
the O
don’t O
get O
offered O
the O
job. O
I O
am O
always O
SO O
NERVOUS O
when O
it O
comes O
time O
for O
the O
interview. O
I O
haven’t O
gone O
job O
hunting O
in O
years O
because O
of O
this O
fear O
and O
I O
don’t O
like O
my O
current O
job. O
I O
just O
don’t O
believe O
I O
can O
appear O
capable. O
Maybe O
this O
helps O
as O
a O
different O
perspective O
[SEP]
Offer O
to O
give O
him O
practice O
interviews O
[SEP]
Since O
you O
have O
expertise O
in O
the O
hiring O
process, O
I O
would O
casually O
offer O
him O
help O
practicing O
and/or O
tips. O
But O
I O
wouldn't O
mention O
"because O
I O
saw O
your O
interview O
and O
you O
are O
terrible", O
more O
like O
"since O
you O
are O
going O
through O
something O
I O
am O
knowledgeable O
in". O
[SEP]
It O
sounds O
like O
he O
has O
not O
asked O
for O
help. O
[SEP]
First O
of O
all O
does O
he O
think O
he O
has O
a O
problem? O
Second O
does O
he O
want O
help/get O
feedback O
so O
he O
recognizes O
he O
has O
a O
problem? O
Third, O
does O
he O
want O
help O
from O
you? O
[SEP]
Get O
the O
first O
question O
answered O
first. O
[SEP]
It O
sounds O
like O
he O
has O
anxiety. O
Lip O
smacking/mouth O
wetting O
is O
a O
sign O
of O
nervousness. O
Offer O
to O
do O
mock O
interviews O
with O
him. O
[SEP]
Interviewing O
is O
a O
skill O
that O
needs O
to O
be O
practiced O
to O
get O
good O
at O
it, O
just O
like O
any O
skill. O
There’s O
this O
interview O
technique O
called O
STAR O
that O
he O
needs O
to O
look O
up. O
It’s O
basically O
like, O
hey O
here’s O
an O
example O
of O
a O
situation O
I O
faced, O
how O
I O
faced O
it, O
and O
what O
the O
results O
were. O
If O
he O
has O
10 O
examples O
like O
this O
and O
practices/memorizes O
them, O
that O
will O
help O
a O
lot O
with O
his O
confidence. O
Also, O
he O
can O
look O
up O
the O
most O
common O
STAR O
interview O
questions O
and O
make O
sure O
he O
has O
examples O
for O
each O
one. O
I O
created O
a O
spreadsheet O
and O
read O
over O
it O
before O
any O
interview, O
just O
to O
center O
myself. O
For O
the O
non O
stop O
Ums, O
you O
might O
try O
recording O
him O
during O
an O
interview O
so O
he O
can O
actually O
hear O
himself. O
If O
you O
think O
this O
would O
backfire, O
he O
can O
put O
a O
little O
note O
next O
to O
his O
camera O
that O
says O
No O
Ums! O
I O
did O
this O
and O
it O
actually O
helps. O
The O
best O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
for O
him O
is O
help O
him O
with O
these O
different O
tricks O
so O
he O
gains O
confidence. O
See O
if O
he’ll O
do O
mock O
interviews O
with O
you O
that O
can O
can O
record O
so O
he O
can O
hear O
himself O
and O
work O
on O
fixing O
issues. O
[SEP]
I O
swear O
I O
could O
have O
written O
this O
post. O
My B-Relationship_Status
fiancé I-Relationship_Status
has I-Relationship_Status
been I-Relationship_Status
job I-Relationship_Status
hunting I-Relationship_Status
for I-Relationship_Status
months I-Relationship_Status
and I-Relationship_Status
has I-Relationship_Status
great I-Relationship_Status
experience I-Relationship_Status
in I-Relationship_Status
his I-Relationship_Status
field I-Relationship_Status
and I-Relationship_Status
a I-Relationship_Status
nice I-Relationship_Status
resume I-Relationship_Status
and I-Relationship_Status
he I-Relationship_Status
lands I-Relationship_Status
multiple I-Relationship_Status
interviews I-Relationship_Status
a I-Relationship_Status
week. I-Relationship_Status
But O
he O
has O
yet O
to O
be O
offered O
a O
position O
and O
I’m O
almost O
100% O
positive O
it’s O
because O
of O
how O
he O
comes O
across O
in O
interviews. O
He O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
interview O
anxiety O
but O
he O
tries O
too O
hard O
to O
play O
it O
cool O
and O
comes O
off O
as O
disinterested. O
I’ve O
tried O
to O
encourage O
him O
to O
show O
his O
personality O
and O
make O
an O
attempt O
to O
make O
a O
personal O
connection O
with O
the O
interviewer, O
but O
he O
says O
he O
likes O
his O
method. O
I’m O
trying O
so O
hard O
to O
not O
damage O
his O
confidence O
but O
he O
is O
also O
his O
own O
biggest O
problem O
[SEP]
I O
don't O
see O
a O
way O
for O
you O
to O
bring O
this O
up O
with O
your O
fiancé O
without O
knocking O
his O
confidence, O
and O
I O
think O
you O
should O
leave O
the O
overall O
topic O
alone O
until O
he O
potentially O
comes O
to O
you O
for O
feedback O
on O
his O
own O
initiative. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
he O
does O
come O
to O
you O
by O
himself, O
even O
if O
only O
to O
just O
vent O
about O
unsuccessful O
interviews, O
you O
can O
remind O
him O
of O
your O
hiring O
and O
managing O
experience O
and O
offer O
to O
go O
over O
his O
CV O
with O
him O
and O
give O
him O
some O
pointers O
for O
future O
interviews. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
However, O
even O
then, O
I O
think O
you O
should O
keep O
your O
observations O
to O
yourself O
and O
just O
offer O
good O
tips O
based O
on O
your O
own O
experience. O
I'm O
sure O
you O
mean O
well, O
but O
I O
don't O
think O
the O
rest O
is O
really O
for O
you O
to O
judge. O
You O
overheard O
him O
talking O
to O
an O
interview O
panel, O
but O
you O
probably O
weren't O
supposed O
to. O
You're O
not O
his O
hiring O
agent O
or O
manager. O
You're O
his O
girlfriend; O
your O
role O
in O
this O
constellation O
is O
different O
and O
your O
criticism O
would O
likely O
have O
an O

[SEP]
Offer O
to O
practice O
interviews O
with O
him. O
I O
failed O
at O
my O
first O
interview O
because O
no O
one O
told O
me O
how O
to O
interview O
and O
I O
was O
way O
too O
casual O
and O
familiar O
and O
nervous O
[SEP]
I’d O
say O
hey O
I O
saw O
a O
really O
great O
YouTube O
or O
TikTok O
about O
interviewing O
it O
made O
me O
think O
about O
your O
job O
hunt. O
Then O
1 O
give O
him O
some O
external O
resources, O
there O
a O
ton O
of O
great O
ones O
on O
YouTube. O
Then O
2 O
say O
they O
suggest O
roleplaying O
an O
interview O
and O
ask O
if O
he’d O
be O
interested O
in O
doing O
that O
with O
you. O
If O
he O
says O
no O
leave O
it O
alone O
if O
he O
says O
yes O
I’d O
role-play O
some O
of O
the O
open O
ended O
questions O
that O
are O
most O
typical O
and O
at O
the O
end O
ask O
if O
he’d O
like O
your O
feedback O
or O
constructive O
criticism O
then O
bring O
up O
the O
things O
you O
notice. O
[SEP]
I O
don’t O
think O
there’s O
anything O
wrong O
with O
helping O
your O
partner O
or O
wanting O
them O
to O
have O
their O
best O
qualities O
shine. O
My B-Relationship_Status

and I-Relationship_Status
I I-Relationship_Status
have I-Relationship_Status
always I-Relationship_Status
helped I-Relationship_Status
each I-Relationship_Status
other I-Relationship_Status

done I-Relationship_Status

It’s O
so O
helpful O
to O
get O
out O
the O
nervous O
energy. O
[SEP]
Wait. O
You O
have O
experience O
in O
recruitment O
and O
didn’t O
even O
help O
him O
practice!? O
Wha? O
[SEP]
Help O
him O
practice. O
For O
my O
last O
job, O
I O
put O
in O
the O
work O
for O
the O
interview: O
googled O
common O
interview O
questions, O
and O
researched O
the O
company, O
and O
practiced O
the O
interview O
over O
the O
phone O
with O
friends O
and O
on O
camera. O
That’s O
what O
it O
takes. O
It O
isn’t O
that O
he O
lacks O
the O
skills O
as O
to O
why O
he O
isn’t O
getting O
hired O
it’s O
that O
he O
sounds O
really O
unprepared. O
[SEP]
He O
is O
your O
fiancé. O
Eventually O
he'll O
be O
your O
husband. O
Just O
talk O
straight O
with O
him. O
It's O
not O
what O
you O
say. O
It's O
how O
you O
say O
it. O
Keep O
it O
positive O
and O
constructive. O
Be O
supportive O
and O
understanding. O
[SEP]
Let O
him O
try O
and O
fail O
on O
his O
own. O
If O
he O
vents O
about O
it O
or O
expresses O
that O
it’s O
not O
going O
how O
he O
wants, O
then O
you O
can O
offer O
to O
help O
without O
letting O
him O
know O
how O
bad O
he O
was O
when O
you O
listened O
in. O
[SEP]
Tell O
him O
it's O
from O
a O
place O
of O
love O
then O
be O
honest; O
it'll O
be O
hard O
to O
hear O
but O
necessary. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
say O
this O
for O
someone O
who O
has O
had O
countless O
career O
jumps O
and O
needs O
slapping O
down O
more. O
[SEP]
Practice O
during O
sexy O
time. O
If O
he O
fails O
the O
question O
then O
you O
show O
him O
how O
to O
answer O
it. O
It's O
a O
great O
way O
to O
help O
him O
build O
confidence. O
[SEP]
He's O
trying O
to O
not O
get O
a O
job. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Jk. O
Idk.. O
But O
hope O
you O
figure O
it O
out O
because O
that's O
a O
delicate O
issue O
to O
try O
and O
address. O
[SEP]
Yeah, O
it's O
tough O
because O
I O
think O
most O
people O
get O
really O
nervous O
for O
interviews. O
To O
be O
honest, O
I O
have O
even O
taken O
a O
beta O
blocker O
beforehand O
because O
I O
was O
so O
jittery. O
Over O
the O
years, O
I've O
developed O
a O
running O
list O
of O
questions O
I've O
either O
been O
asked O
or O
anticipated O
being O
asked O
and O
the O
responses O
to O
gonwith O
them. O
I O
usually O
go O
over O
those O
about O
5 O
times, O
so O
I O
have O
them O
in O
my O
head O
but O
am O
not O
over O
rehearsed. O
I've O
even O
recorded O
myself O
asking O
the O
questions O
and O
filmed O
myself O
answering O
them O
to O
get O
used O
to O
it. O
I O
think O
you O
should O
go O
for O
it O
if O
you O
want O
to O
apply O
to O
other O
jobs! O
Each O
interview O
is O
practice O
so O
that O
even O
if O
you O
don't O
get O
a O
job, O
you're O
prepared O
when O
the O
right O
one O
comes O
along! O
[SEP]
It O
definitely O
takes O
practice O
to O
do, O
I O
usually O
have O
to O
rehearse O
my O
answers O
for O
it O
to O
come O
out O
smoothly. O
I O
have O
to O
do O
it O
every O
time O
otherwise O
I O
become O
awkward O
again O
lol! O
It O
definitely O
doesn't O
come O
naturally. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
you O
can O
get O
someone O
to O
do O
practice O
interviews O
with O
you, O
they O
can O
be O
loads O
of O
help. O
(Though O
it O
always O
feels O
cringy O

There O

a O

called O
UNIVERSAL O

(free O

that O
has O
a O

about O

One O
whole O

is O
about O
practicing O

a O

[SEP]
This! O
You O
don't O
have O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
you O
actually O
saw/heard O
him. O
When O
he O
tells O
you O
that O
he O
wasn't O
hired O
after O
the O
interview O
give O
some O
general O
advice O
how O
to O
handle O
a O

And O
without O
him O
knowing O

the O

It's O
a O

I O
take O
it O
for O
tachycardia/rapid O

I O
mean O
it O
does O
lower O
your O
racing O
heart O
and O
that O
calms O
you. O
I O
think O
in O
his O
case O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
being O
out O
of O
practice O
in O
"selling O
himself." O
My O
exhusband O
had O
similar O
trouble O
decades O
ago O
when O
trying O
to O
switch O
fields. O
Years O
later O
after O
our O
divorce O
he O
YouTube O
researched O
"how O
to" O
interviews O
and O
common O
questions O
asked. O
He O
has O
now O
nailed O
several O
very O
very O
important O
awesome O

He's O
a O

at O

we're O

now O

I O

been O
that O
most O

pretty O
chill O
about O

[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
usually O
say O
something O

"uh, O

I'm O

I O
follow O
up O

"thank O

now O
they'd O
need O
to O

they O
just O

move O

I'm O

a O

Of O

only O
if O

it O

Many O

I O

The O

pulling O
more O

darting/lunging O

the O

way O

Less O

for O
the O

doesn't O

Walking O
right O

really O
natural O
for O

Roaming, O
zigzagging, O
and O
sniffing O
it O
how O
dogs O
naturally O
walk. O
And O
all O
thought O
those O
are O
often O
connected O
to O
pulling, O
pulling O
is O
not O
required O
for O
a O
dog O

those O
things. O
A O
dog O
can O
learn O

be O
trained O
to O
walk O
in O
a O

that O
requires O

association O

can O
be O
many O

praise, O
removal O
of O
unpleasant O
stimuli, O
and O
or O
play O
(pre-mac O
principal.) O
There O
are O
benefits O
and O
downsides O
to O
different O
reinforcement O
methods. O
And O
it O
really O
depends O
what O
the O
dog O
cares O
about O
the O
most O
in O
the O
moment. O
If O
squirrels O
and O
smelling O
is O
way O
more O
important O
than O
treats O
using O
treats O
during O
walks O
is O
going O
to O
be O
inefficient. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Additionally O
dogs O
don't O
generalize O
training O
to O
different O
handlers O
easily. O
Even O
if O
the O
pet O
parents O
started O
training O
and O
were O
diligent, O
you O
would O
not O
see O
an O
effect O
for O
some O
time. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
My O
recommendation O
and O
suggestion O
for O
you O
is O
to O
either O
decline O
walking O
them, O
or O
work O
on O
better O
walking O
communication O
between O
you O
and O
the O
dog. O
Not O
every O
dog O
works O
well O
with O
every O
persons O
walking O
style O
and O
vice O
versa. O
I O
would O
recommend O
looking O
into O
loose O
leash O
walking O
methods. O
I O
walk O
many O
dogs O
that O
just O
need O
a O
little O
more O
space O
to O
roam, O
safely, O
to O
then O
start O
actually O
paying O
attention O
to O
where O
I O
wanted O
to O
walk. O
[SEP]
I O
have O
a O
doggo O
like O
this O
and O
unfortunately O
has O
a O
pace O
maker O
so O
cannot O
use O
anything O
around O
his O
neck O
so O
he O
wears O
a O
harness. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
use O
a O
lead O
that O
has O
a O
little O
pull O
elastic O
in O
it, O
I O
think O
it’s O
a O
no O
pull O
lead. O
When O
we’re O
out O
walking O
I O
usually O
figure O
if O
8 O
back O
and O
forth O
up O
and O
down O
my O
garden. O
He O
is O
much O
better O
with O
me O
but O
because O
of O
his O
pace O
maker O
I’ve O
had O
to O
put O
in O
the O
work O
as O
I’m O
not O
as O
confident O
to O
let O
him O
pull. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Patience O
is O
a O
virtue O
unfortunately O
but O
perhaps O
make O
the O
owners O
aware O
of O
the O
harm O
it O
does O
to O
you O
physically O
also O
and O
how O
you O
don’t O
know O
if O
you O
can O
continue O
without O
some O
co O
operation. O
[SEP]
Like O
previous O
people O
have O
said O
try O
a O
harness O
with O
the O
owner's O
approval. O
Use O
treats. O
Get O
her O
attention O
on O
you O
before O
you O
go O
on O
the O
walk. O
Have O
her O
sit, O
look O
at O
you. O
Maybe O
do O
a O
few O
recalls, O
anything O
to O
kind O
of O
get O
her O
calmed O
down O
and O
more O
focused O
on O
you O
than O
the O
walk. O
Even O
if O
it's O
just O
for O
a O
moment O
it O
will O
help O
during O
the O
walk. O

Not O
sure O
how O
quickly O
the O
dog O
will O
learn, O
but O
with O
my O
clients O
who O
do O
this, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
pull O
too O
hard O
I O
stop O
walking O
completely. O
Usually O
the O
dog O
is O
like O
??? O
When O
there's O
slack O
we O
keep O
going. O
Most O
dogs O
figure O
it O
out O
enough O
that O
walking O
with O
me O
specifically O
+ O
pulling O
= O
not O
going O
anywhere. O
It's O
not O
a O
long O
term O
solution O
but O
it'll O
save O
you O
some O
pulled O
muscles. O
[SEP]
Get O
the O
lead O
that O
pulls O
from O
the O
front O
of O
the O
dog O
as O
others O
have O
mentioned. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Training O
takes O
a O
lot O
of O
repetition. O
Every O
time O
the O
dog O
pulls O
on O
the O
lead O
I O
stop. O
I O
walk O
forward O
when O
they O
are O
calm O
and O
praise O
them. O
If O
they O
pull O
again O
I O
stop. O
And O
again O
and O
again. O
You O
have O
to O
continue O
this O
even O
if O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
and O
they O
start O
to O
realise O
they O
don't O
go O
anywhere O
unless O
they O
stop O
pulling. O
But O
for O
the O
time O
restrictions O
of O
walking O
on O
Rover O
and O
your O
main O
purpose O
being O
to O
exercise O
the O
dog O
not O
train O
it, O
I O
would O
opt O
for O
the O
lead O
if O
the O
owners O
approve. O
[SEP]
I O
swear O
by O
Weiss O
walkie O
leashes. O
My O
own O
dogs O
are O
horrible O
pullers O
on O
walks O
and O
they O
still O
pull, O
but O
it O
does O
lessen O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
than O
any O
other O
leash O
we've O
tried. O
I O
use O
it O
on O
one O
of O
my O
regulars O
too O
(with O
permission) O
and O
she O
pulls O
so O
much O
less! O
[SEP]
Unfortunately, O
there's O
not O
a O
lot O
else O
you O
can O
do O
without O
the O
owner's O
approval. O
I O
would O
recommend O
having O
another O
very O
serious O
conversation O
with O
the O
owners O
where O
you O
essentially O
say, O
"Look, O
if O
you O
don't O
do O
something O
about O
this O
- O
such O
as O
hiring O
a O
trainer O
or O
purchasing O
tools O
like O
a O
prong O
collar O
- O
I O
will O
be O
terminating O
this O
relationship O
as O
it O
has O
gotten O
completely O
out O
of O
hand." O
And O
if O
they O
don't O
do O
anything, O
follow O
through O
on O
it O
and O
terminate O
the O
relationship. O
[SEP]
See O
if O
owners O
would O
be O
interested O
in O
getting O
a O
prong O
or O
gentle O
leader. O
I've O
seen O
the O
gentle O
leaders O
work O
magic O
with O
pullers! O
[SEP]
My B-Pet
dog I-Pet
used I-Pet
to I-Pet
pull I-Pet
and O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
helped O
was O
lots O
and O
lots O
of O
leash O
corrections. O
What O
I O
do O
is O
slightly O
tug O
the O
leash O
or O
just O
allow O
the O
dog O
to O
catch O
the O
end O
of O
the O
leash O
and O
then O
head O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction. O
Eventually O
she O
got O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
only O
way O
to O
actually O
move O
forward O
on O
the O
walk O
is O
to O
stay O
by O
me. O
I O
had O
to O
accept O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
might O
not O
get O
very O
far O
physically O
during O
the O
walk, O
but O
my O
dog O
is O
usually O
still O
pretty O
worn O
out O
from O
having O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
what O
she O
is O
doing. O
Overall O
it O
can O
take O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
to O
break O
a O
pulling O
habit, O
but O
might O
be O
worth O
it O
in O
the O
long O
run O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
see O
the O
dog O
on O
a O
continual O
basis. O
[SEP]
I O
can O
handle O
her O
since O
she's O
a O
smaller O
dog, O
it's O
just O
the O
biggest O
issue O
for O
me O
is O
walking. O
One O
time, O
we O
passed O
by O
someone, O
and O
they O
said, O
"Who's O
walking O
who?" O
which O
was O
embarrassing. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
She O
also O
sometimes O
doesn't O
listen, O
which O
is O
weird O
bc O
she O
used O
to O
be O
good O
abt O
it O
before. O
I'm O
not O
sure O
what's O
happened, O
maybe O
bc O
she's O
almost O
3, O
and O
these O
behaviors O
have O
set O
in O
with O
her O
owners, O
and O
I O
handle O
it O
differently. O
Our O
she O
doesn't O
like O
my O
style. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
told O
them O
she's O
not O
listening O
to O
me O
as O
much, O
and O
they O
just O
said O
it O
was O
weird O
since O
she O
listens O
to O
them. O
Maybe O
it's O
a O
respect O
thing? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
i O
see O
your O
point. O
I O
wonder O
if O
charging O
more O
would O
make O
it O
worth O
it. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
recommendation, O
I O
will O
see O
what O
they O
say. O
Her O
harness O
now O
has O
no O
front O
clip, O
so O
I O
think O
that O
also O
contributes. O
I O
always O
use O
the O
front O
clip O
with O
other O
dogs O
who O
pull O
or O
are O
leash O
aggressive. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you, O
I O
will O
talk O
to O
them. O
[SEP]
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
suggestion, O
I O
hadn't O
heard O
of O
loose O
leash O
walking. O
I O
will O
research O
and O
try O
it. O
[SEP]

I O
see O
the O
dog O
almost O
every O
month O
for O
housesitting. O
These O
ppl O
got O
a O
dog O
in O
covid, O
hadn't O
had O
a O
dog O
since O
they O
were O
young, O
and O
they'd O
only O
had O
cats. O
And O
it'd O
been O
like O
10 O
years O
since O
they O
had O
any O
pets. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Now O
that O
everything's O
been O
lifted, O
they O
travel O
as O
often O
as O
they O
used O
to O
before O
the O
dog. O
Once O
or O
twice O
a O
month, O
for O
at O
least O
5 O
days. O
I'm O
currently O
almost O
done O
with O
a O
3-week O
stay. O
And O
they O
leave O
for O
another O
trip O
next O
week O
🙃 O
[SEP]
[SEP]
They O
canceled O
two O
long O
trips O
next O
year O
bc O
they're O
realizing O
they O
don't O
want O
to O
leave O
their O
dog O
so O
often... O
it's O
the O
classic O
covid O
dog O
issues O
that O
we O
all O
hear O
and O
read O
abt. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
And O
the O
jumping O
when O
on O
walks O
omg. O
I've O
walked O
other O
dogs O
in O
their O
neighborhood, O
and O
when O
I O
come O
across O
them, O
sue O
jumps O
to O
see O
me, O
and O
the O
owners O
barely O
stop O
it. O
I O
always O
try, O
and O
they O
get O
the O
hint O
to O
stop O
her. O

walking O

you O
would O
be O

way O
for O

It's O
that O
or O
up O
the O

Omg O
I O
walk O
a O
dog O
with O
a O
front O
clip O
harness O
and O
he O
will O
use O
it O
to O
drag O
me O
*backward*. O
He’s O
not O
obese O
since O
I’ve O
been O
walking O
him O
almost O
daily O
for O
a O
few O
months, O
so O
he’s O
not O
as O
bad O
now, O
but O
trust O
me O
when O
I O
say: O
any O
lead O
can O
suck O
with O
the O
wrong O
dog! O
😂 O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I’m O
currently O
doing O
drop O
ins O
with O
a O
9 O
month O
old O
puppy O
who O
wasn’t O
trained O
(so O
much O
biting O
and O
jumping O
and O
pulling O
at O
the O
meet O
and O
greet) O
and O
after O
the O
first O
drop-in, O
I O
brought O
my O
dog’s O
extra O
Halti O
(like O
a O
gentle O
leader), O
because O
this O
puppy’s O
normal O
collar O
fits O
weird O
(it O
slides O
down O
her O
neck O
and O
gives O
her O
a O
lot O
of O
leverage O
to O
choke O
herself O
😞). O
She O
clearly O
hated O
it O
at O
first, O
but O
wow, O
so O
much O
less O
pulling, O
because O
it’s O
easier O
to O
get O
her O
to O
notice O
with O
even O
a O
little O
tension O
at O
the O
top O
of O
her O
neck O
(that’s O
the O
most O
important O
thing), O
and O
she’ll O
let O
up O
on O
the O
leash. O
If O
I O
had O
a O
slip O
lead, O
I’d O
prefer O
that O
for O
her O
(the O
portion O
around O
her O
muzzle O
annoys O
her, O
and O
she O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
train, O
so O
she O
really O
just O
needs O
biofeedback—even O
a O
martingale O
collar O
would O
do O
wonders), O
but O
I O
don’t O
recommend O
slip O
leads O
to O
everyone, O
because O
there’s O
a O
steep O
learning O
curve O
(though O
I O
really O
like O
them O
as O
a O
general O
use O
training O
leash). O
[SEP]
[SEP]
The O
best O
advice O
I O
have O
that O
isn’t O
tool-based O
(because O
imo, O
people O
do O
expect O
too O
much O
from O
the O
tool O
vs O
how O
you O
use O
it): O
pull O
up, O
not O
back, O
on O
the O
leash O
for O
pullers. O
You O
want O
better O
biofeedback O
for O
pullers, O
and O
that O
means O
higher O
on O
the O
neck—both O
safer O
for O
them O
and O
less O
annoying O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
Or O
you O
can O
just O
say O
you’re O
more O
comfortable O
using O
a O
harness O
and O
just O
make O
sure O
it O
has O
a O
front O
clip. O
A O
gentle O
leader O
will O
require O
way O
more O
training O
bc O
the O
dogs O
hate O
wearing O
it O
on O
their O
head O
in O
the O
beginning O
and O
most O
owners O
will O
think O
the O
head O
collar O
is O
hurting O
their O
pet(from O
my O
experience.) O
[SEP]
Yep O
I O
am O
very O
familiar O
with O
Covid O
puppies! O
Loose O
leash O
walking O
is O
a O
broad O
term O
and O
there O
are O
different O
styles. O
But O
the O
main O
factor O
is O
the O
leash O
is O
not O
what's O
controlling O
the O
dog. O
The O
leash O
is O
just O
a O
secondary O
safety. O
[SEP]
Covid O
puppies O
are O
prone O
to O
overstimulation O
or O
over O
arousal O
that O
causes O
zoomies O
and O
over O
excitement O
behavior. O
Doing O
a O
snaifari, O
decompression, O
or O
mental O
exercise O
is O
really O
good O
for O
them. O
Here O
is O
a O
video O
of O
a O
sniffari. O
(I O
am O
not O
familiar O
with O
this O
company/group. O

just O

You O
don't O
have O
to O
have O
a O
long O
leash O
it O
just O
has O
to O
be O
long O
enough O
that O
it O
doesn't O
get O
tight O
when O
they O
are O
roaming. O

Additionally O
if O
you O
see O
them O
do O
these O
signs O
https://cattledogpublishing.com/product/body-language-of-fear-in-dogs/ O
and O
or O
shakeouts, O
their O
behavior O
maybe O
from O
stress, O
or O
over O
stimulation. O
[SEP]
Oh, O
completely O
agree. O
They O
likely O
wouldn't O
even O
get O
a O

a O
properly O

prong. O

It's O
surprising O
bc O
she's O

The O
video O
you O
posted O
is, O
at O
the O
very O

from O
an O
certified O
fear-free O
trainer O

Her O
information O
is O
right O
in O
line O
with O
other O

My O
most O
regular O
client O
was O
a O
puller. O
In O
addition O
to O
loose O
leash O
walking O
training O
I O
also O
got O
permission O
from O
her O
owner O
to O
use O
a O
long O
line O
for O
her O
walks. O
Now O
that O
she O
gets O
to O
spend O
50-75% O
of O
her O
walks O
making O
her O
own O
choices O
and O
smelling O
just O
about O
anything O
she O
wants O
her O
owner O
has O
told O
me O
she's O
become O
a O
loose O
leash O
champ O
when O
being O
walked O
by O
her O
family O
(this O
is O
still O
a O
relative O
term, O
she O
still O
pulls O
sometimes, O
but O
far O
less O
than O
she O
used O
to). O
She's O
still O
on O
a O
front-clip O
harness O
unless O
we're O
in O
a O
big O
open O
area, O
otherwise O
I O
do O
a O
lot O
of O
active O
management O
of O
the O
long O
line. O
My O
gear O
is O
a O
15' O
biothane O
long O
line O
by O
Viper, O
which O
stays O
stink-free O
and O
has O
durable O
brass O

As O
someone O
who O
has O
had O
to O
educate O
clients O
on O
prongs, O
they O
definitely O
won't. O
I O
worked O
with O
a O
trainer O
using O
one O
for O
my O
husky O
mix O
who O
was O
a O
notorious O
puller O
so O
I O
know O
my O
way O
around O
them. O
Had O
one O
lab O
drag O
its O
owner O
across O
my O
front O
yard O
when O
getting O
dropped O
off O
the O
first O
time, O
the O
prong O
was O
a O
necklace. O
Loose O
and O
down O
around O
the O
base O
of O
the O
neck, O
not O
doing O
a O
damn O
thing. O
Thankfully O
he O
was O
receptive O
on O
pick-up O
when O
I O
offered O
to O
show O
him O
how O
to O
properly O
fit O
it, O
and O
where O
it O
should O
rest, O
etc. O
When O
she O
was O
dropped O
off O
the O
next O
time O
it O
was O
still O
correctly O
fitted! O
Though O
she O
still O
dragged O
him O
across O
the O
yard....because O
he O
had O
switched O
to O
using O
a O
flexi-lead O
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) O
There's O
only O
so O
much O
I'm O
willing O
to O
put O
the O
energy O
into O
fixing O
and O
since O
this O
dog O
was O
happy O
with O
just O
yard O
time O
I O
let O
it O
go. O

After O

I O
finally O

yesterday O
12/1. O
It O

I O

just O
in O
case O
no O

in O

I O
also O
secured O
an O

the O

[SEP]

I O

in O
the O
worst O
case, O
I O
can O
just O
cancel O
my O

right O
on O
the O

[SEP]
No O
it O
won’t O
be O
an O

If O
you O
manage O

EoA O
the O

gets O

once O

At O

that’s O
what O

when O

EoA O
back O

I O
went O

the O

asked O

"where O

you O

"have O

[SEP]
20 O

by O
clicking O

After O

If O

I'm O

I O
do O

how O

we O

you O

I’m O
assuming O
your O

the O
one O

So O
do O
you O
want O

write O

should O
I? O

Sea, O
I O
did O
try O
sending O

you O

[SEP]
Hi O
Guys, O
[SEP]
I'm O
new O
to O
the O
car O
market O
and O
have O
little O
idea O
about O
cars, O
what O
i O
know O
comes O
from O

[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
looking O
to O
buy O
a O
car O
under O
10 O
lakh O
(on O
road) O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
live O
alone O
and O
majorly O
will O
be O
using O
this O
to O
commute O
to O
office O
(20kms O
up O
down) O
and O
some O
casual O
rides O
with O
friends O
within O
the O
city O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I B-Location
live I-Location
in I-Location
Noida I-Location
and O
I O
would O
prefer O
to O
get O
the O
top O
variant O
or O
the O
variant O
below O
it O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
am O
a O
bit O
inclined O
towards O
Tata O
&amp; O
Hyundai, O
but O
am O
open O
to O
suggestions O
[SEP]
[SEP]
So O
far O
my O
top O
2 O
preferences O
are O
[SEP]
[SEP]
TATA O
TIAGO O
NRG O
[SEP]
[SEP]
[SEP]
HYUNDAI O
I20 O
SPORTZ O
PETROL O

Which O
one O
should O
i O
go O
for? O
Also O
any O
other O
suggestions O
are O
welcome O
[SEP]
Hey! O
Welcome O
to O
the O
club O
[SEP]
[SEP]
If O
safety O
is O
your O
first O
priority, O
you O
should O
hands O
down O
go O
for O
Tata O
however, O
their O
after O
sales O
service O
isn’t O
up O
to O
the O
mark O
& O
their O
have O
been O
numerous O
cases O
of O
service O
centres O
just O
not O
being O
upto O
the O
mark. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Otherwise, O
you O
can O
also O
try O
out O
the O
Grand O
I10 O
Nios, O
you’d O
probably O
get O
the O
top O
end O
model O
within O
10L. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
You O
can O
also O
check O
out O
Maruti O
Baleno O
or O
Ignis O
( O
Both O
sold O
through O
NEXA O
outlets), O
Maruti O
is O
high O
on O
mileage O
& O
great O
service O
centre O
coverage O
however, O
safety O
is O
a O
concern O
here. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
hope O
you O
find O
what O
you’re O
looking O
for! O
All O
the O
best O
[SEP]
Since O
you O
live O
in O
Noida O
I'm O
assuming O
that O
roads O
are O
good.. O
why O
not O
get O
the O
4th O
gen O
Honda O
City. O
It O
would O
be O
a O
little O
over O
your O
budget O
but O
that O
car O
is O
much O
better O
than O
any O
other O
in O
that O
budget. O
You O
get O
a O
spacious O
car O
with O
a O
great O
engine O
and O
good O
safety O
ratings O
. O
[SEP]
Citroën O
C3 O
turbo O
top O
end O
[SEP]
Why O
not O
Tiago O
ev? O
[SEP]
You O
can O
also O
check O
ignis O
if O
you O
are O
okay O
with O
it's O
looks O
[SEP]
I20 O
facelift O
launching O
next O
year O
so O
buying O
now O
will O
make O
no O
sense O
no O
resale O
value.Tata O
is O
boring O
considering O
interiors O
and O
features O
for O
2022,check O
Baleno O
2022 O
it O
has O
good O
resale O
value O
and O
features O
are O
top O
notch. O
[SEP]
Bro O
if O
your O
budget O
is O
10lakhs O
then O
you O
can O
ho O
for O
Kia O
Sonet O
Htk+ O
petrol O
variant O
it O
is O
a O
best O
in O
segment O
car O
under O
10 O
lakhs O
and O
personally O
i O
am O
using O
it O
for O
1.5 O

[SEP]
Would O
you O
recommend O
the O
i10 O
nios O
over O
the O
i20 O
sportz O
variant? O
[SEP]
[SEP]
Not O
really O
preferring O
maruti O
due O
to O
the O
same O
reason O
you O
mentioned, O
safety. O

Why O
shouldn't O
safety O
be O
the O
first O

I O
live O
in O
a O
pg O
so O
charging O
the O
ev O
at O

is O
not O
going O
to O
be O
possible O
and O
it's O
not O
worth O
charging O
from O
those O
fast O
charging O
stations O
because O
they O
take O
like O
an O
hour O
for O
full O
charge O
[SEP]
Because O
some O
times O
people O
buy O
cars O
with O
greater O
mileage O
& O
low O
on O
safety O
because O
their O
budgets O
aren’t O
very O
high. O
[SEP]
So O
savings O
on O
mileage O
will O
be O
used O
for O
medical O
treatment O
if O
the O
car O
gets O
into O
an O
RTA? O
This O
mileage O
logic O
is O
exactly O
why O
India O
is O
not O
getting O
safer O
cars. O
Majority O
wants O
mileage O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
safety. O

If O
Tata O
can O

affordable O
safe O

why O
can't O
MS O

Hyundai? O

Hitting O

it O

them O
forever. O
I O
couldn’t O

I O

I O
have O
experienced O
this. O
The O
word O
for O
it O
is O
codependency O
if O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
accept O
that O
label. O
I've O
often O
wondered O
the O
same O
about O
my O
preferences, O
but O
it O
goes O
deeper O
than O
that. O
It's O
looking O
for O
feedback O
and O
emotional O
healing O
from O
those O
around O
you O
rather O
than O
trusting O
yourself. O
Could O
have O
a O
lot O
to O
do O
with O
self-esteem, O
trauma O
and O
emotional O
abuse O
like O
in O
my O
case O
or O
you O
could O
have O
completely O
different O
causes. O
My O
point O
is, O
find O
out O
what O
those O
things O
are O
and O
address O
them. O
This O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
thing O
to O
work O
on, O
but O
you O
can O
do O
it. O
There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
materials, O
books, O
and O
groups O
around O
these O
issues. O
If O
you O
need O
direct O
links, O
just O
ask. O
Hoping O
everything O
works O
out O
for O
you. O
[SEP]
You're O
not O
alone. O
[SEP]
I O
feel O
a O
similar O
way O
too, O
I've O
called O
them O
my O
"best O
friend O
in O
phases O
of O
my O
life" O
they O
were O
people O
I O
stuck O
with O
because O
I O
liked O
them, O
I O
liked O
them O
so O
much O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
more O
like O
them. O
I O
ended O
up O
basing O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
likes, O
opinions O
and O
personality O
based O
on O
them. O
It O
feels O
like O
I O
don't O
really O
have O
an O
original O
thought O
and O
I'm O
constantly O
changing O
based O
on O
who O
I'm O
with. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
But O
I O
think O
that's O
just O
a O
part O
of O
being O
human, O
we O
grow O
up O
depending O
on O
one O
another O
to O
figure O
things O
out, O
we O
end O
up O
mimicking O
things O
others O
do O
and O
pouring O
hours O
into O
similar O
hobbies O
that O
they O
like. O
It O
becomes O
sort O
of O
a O
nurtured O
hobby O
I O
guess? O
But O
I O
think O
it's O
all O
a O
part O
of O
discovering O
things O
you O
like?? O
And O
aspects O
of O
others O
that O
you O
resonante O
with? O
I O
think O
who O
we O
are O
as O
individuals O
is O
a O
mix O
of O
all O
the O
people O
were O
close O
to O
and O
attach O
ourselves O
to. O
[SEP]
[SEP]
I O
don't O
think O
you're O
crazy, O
I O
can O
relate O
to O
the O
anxiety O
of O
people O
not O
liking O
you O
and O
the O
paranoia O
of O
the O
world O
hating O
you. O
It O
sucks, O
but O
there O
are O
people O
around O
you O
who O
are O
obviously O
supporting O
you O
(like O
your O
mom O
and O
siblings,) O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
start O
a O
journey O
of O
being O
less O
dependant O
then O
I O
think O
you O
can O
talk O
to O
them O
about O
it O
and O
let O
them O
guide O
you O
(counterintuitive O
bc O
you O
need O
to O
depend O
on O
them O
to O
help O
you O
be O
more O
independent O
but O
I O
think O
it's O
okay) O
[SEP]
Whilst O
there's O
a O
lot O
to O
say, O
perhaps O
this O
may O
help O
most. O
You O
say O
you O
put O
everything O
into O
one O
person, O
make O
that O

yourself. O
It's O
your O

you're O

I O

this O

I B-Personal_Experiences

cptsd I-Personal_Experiences
from I-Personal_Experiences
sexual I-Personal_Experiences
and I-Personal_Experiences
emotional I-Personal_Experiences

and O
I O
thought O
maybe O
it O
stemmed O
from O
it. O
I O
went O
to O
an O
advocacy O
center O
as O
a O
kid O
and O
they O
told O
me O
it O
was O
minor O
DID O
symptoms, O
but O
people O
I’ve O
talked O
to O
who O
have O
DID O
experience O
symptoms O
completely O
different O
than O
me. O
I O
feel O
misdiagnosed. O
I O
just O
wanna O
get O
better O
at O
learning O
myself, O
and O
understanding O
how O
to O
cope. O

Thank O
you❤️❤️ O

Awesome! O
Same! O
I O
think O
DID O
is O
unlikely O
just O
statistically. O
I O
definitely O
qualify O
for O
a O
dissociative O
diagnosis O
though, O
which O
maybe O
you O
have O
experienced. O
That O
includes O
flashbacks O
and O
out O
of O
body O
experiences O
or O
a O
state O
of O
complete O
confusion O
where O
you O
can't O
center O
yourself O
in O
your O
identity O
and O
whether O
reality O
is O
present O
or O
you're O
in O
a O
dream. O
For O
me O
that O
part O
can O
be O
really O
scary. O
I'm O
saying O
all O
this O
because O
working O
on O
my O
codependency O
has O
really O
helped O
with O
the O
anxiety O
that O
causes O
a O
cascading O
effect O
of O
other O
symptoms. O
I O
hope O
that O
information O
is O
helpful O
and O
you O
feel O
supported. O
Hopefully O
some O
others O
comment O

well. O

My B-Family
son I-Family
had I-Family
a I-Family
strep I-Family
and I-Family
double I-Family
ear I-Family
infection I-Family
one B-Time
month I-Time
ago. I-Time
Had O
him O
on O
amoxicillin O
for O
2 O
days O
before O
he O
lost O
it O
and O
refused O
to O
take O
it O
anymore O
(ADHD)- O
his O
symptoms O
improved O
so O
we O
regrettably O
let O
it O
slide. O
He O
came O
home O
yesterday O
not O
feeling O
well, O
had O
a O
temp O
of O
101.7 O
and O
there O
was O
swelling O
near O
the O
back O
of O
his O
right O
jaw O
and O
under O
his O
right O
ear. O
This O
morning, O
still O
had O
a O
temp O
of O
101, O
swelling, O
and O
complained O
of O
ear O
pain- O
started O
him O
back O
on O
amoxicillin O
last O
night O
(new O
script O
from O
an O
NP O
I O
work O
with). O
Gave O
him O
Tylenol O
around O
7am O
today, O
no O
fever O
or O
pain O
as O
of O
now O
(3pm), O
but O
that O
area O
is O
swollen, O
red O
l, O
and O
warm O
to O
the O
touch. O
He O
said O
his O
teeth O
don't O
hurt O
at O
all O
and O
he O
just O
had O
a O
dental O
check O
up O
3 O
weeks O
ago. O
Was O
going O
to O
wait O
until O
tomorrow O
to O
see O
how O
it O
is O
before O
we O
rank O
up O
more O
bills O
at O
urgent O
care, O
but O
I'm O
worried O
about O
the O
swelling. O
Could O
this O
be O
caused O
by O
an O
ear O
infection O
or O
more O
serious, O
like O
something O
residual O
from O
strep? O
He O
is O
fully O
vaccinated, O
was O
panicking O
about O
mumps O
when O
I O
first O
saw O
him O
yesterday. O
Eating O

In O
the O
setting O
of O
strep/an O
ear O
infection O
that O
wasn't O
fully O
treated, O
the O
lingering O
bacteria O
could O
have O
infected O
the O
mastoid O
bone, O
which O
is O
located O
behind O
the O
lower O
ear. O
Tbh O
mastoiditis O
is O
nothing O
to O
play O
around O
about, O
so O
even O
though O
it O
