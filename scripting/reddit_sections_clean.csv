1000qw9,whiskey,0,How much have you spent on whiskey this 2022?,9
1000qw9,whiskey,1,I have been mostly quiet for the year but for the last quarter i have spent almost $700 on whiskies. I think that is a bit too much if you ask me and it is only for my personal consumption. Although this would probably last me for a good while. Happy New Year everybody!,54
1000qw9,whiskey,2,"This sounds like a set up. Ii think you might be my wife. The gig is up honey, I know its you. Like I told you before, all these bottles are really hard to find and they were only like $100 for all of them.",45
1000qw9,whiskey,3,According to my my Total Wines points... about 6k.,9
1000qw9,whiskey,4,I ain’t no snitch.,4
1000qw9,whiskey,5,Bout tree fiddy,3
1000qw9,whiskey,6,Not going to play this game…,6
1000qw9,whiskey,7,"This is a question you don’t ask, sir. Mind your beeswax lol",12
1000qw9,whiskey,8,Probably a couple hundred a month average,7
1000qw9,whiskey,9,Less than 1 grand. Collection of open bottles for way to big. Going to work on sharing and finishing a,20
1000qw9,whiskey,10,Majority of the stash this year before dropping more money on delicious bread juice,14
1000qw9,whiskey,11,"Probably close to $5k or so, but I'm too fond of my mental health to go check.",17
1000qw9,whiskey,12,I actually did great lol. I made conscious effort to not drink as much this year and money has been tight all year. I bought an Eagle Rare and Buffalo Trace for a total of $50 on base. I bought a little bottle of Jim Beam to sneak into a concert.,51
1000qw9,whiskey,13,I'd guess about $1000- $1200,5
1000qw9,whiskey,14,I'd guess about $2K. Most of these were hard to find and/or stocking up on favorites that are hard to find in my area.,24
1000qw9,whiskey,15,I am pleading the fifth on this one,8
1000qw9,whiskey,16,About 3k. But half of that is because I buy for my neighborhood cigar and bourbon group which spends about $150 a month on cigars and $150 on cigars.,29
1000qw9,whiskey,17,Probably $300 or so for myself and $150 in gifted bottles. If we’re talking booze in general that number’s gonna be sufficiently higher.,23
1000qw9,whiskey,18,"Probably only about $400-500. Of course, that’s conveniently leaving out our yearly trip to Kentucky but I’d rather not think about that.",22
1000qw9,whiskey,19,Too much yet not enough.,5
1000qw9,whiskey,20,I'm about there too,4
1000qw9,whiskey,21,"I just got back into bourbon in July, so way more than I care to admit.",16
1000qw9,whiskey,22,Don’t make me stare into the abyss,7
1000qw9,whiskey,23,"Less than $250. Bought quite a bit between 2020-21. We hardly drink as it is, but I like buying it and having a glass occasionally.",25
1000qw9,whiskey,24,Trying to mess up my nye thinking about this!! Gahhhhh,10
1000qw9,whiskey,25,"First year with whiskey, spent about 1k but about 700 of that was cash my work gave me on a bourbon trail trip",23
1000qw9,whiskey,26,Ha! Nice try… this has to be my fiancé,9
1000qw9,whiskey,27,Too much to tell my lady…,6
1000qw9,whiskey,28,"According to my wife, too much 😅",7
1000qw9,whiskey,29,I don’t count.,3
1000qw9,whiskey,30,I starred spending $100/mo and ramped up to $500 a month when I joined Whiskey Raiders single barrel program .,20
1000qw9,whiskey,31,I don’t really want to know.,6
1000qw9,whiskey,32,Too much,2
1000qw9,whiskey,33,Anywhere from $30-100 a week. I got a nice collection so far.,12
1000qw9,whiskey,34,Enough,1
1000qw9,whiskey,35,I just started in dec and I’m up too 130. So you’re ok,13
1000qw9,whiskey,36,"Once I found a spot that had the good stuff for good prices I started buying a lot more than normal so I could try a lot bourbons. A few JD, a couple Makers, EC, ER, Rowan’s, Noah’s, willet, bookers, buff trace, Weller, blantons.. easily over 1k closer to 2k this year. And probably $150 a week on wine plus beer. So maybe 23 … aim for less lol",69
1000qw9,whiskey,37,"I could work it out, but then I might feel sad...",11
1000qw9,whiskey,38,Suffice to say I bought 88 bottles during 2022.,9
1000qw9,whiskey,39,"I wanna say $500, I’m minimum wage with a priority",10
1000qw9,whiskey,40,"I’m about the same amount as you, maybe a little more, and honestly I’m not buying anymore until half the cabinet is empty.",23
1000qw9,whiskey,41,Around 6-7k this year. A few big boy bottles bumped that up much higher than a typical year but I just couldn’t pass on some of them.,27
1000qw9,whiskey,42,"Between $1K - 2K. Hell, the one bottle of KC 18y was close to $200 after taxes.",17
1000qw9,whiskey,43,"I’m not sure exactly the number, especially if it’s counting my bourbon trail trip, I’d probably guess (including that) 3-4K",20
1000qw9,whiskey,44,If I don’t include that probably 2K,7
1000qw9,whiskey,45,"$1,200",1
1000qw9,whiskey,46,Too much,2
1000qw9,whiskey,47,I don’t know and I don’t want to know.,9
1000qw9,whiskey,48,At least 3,3
1000qw9,whiskey,49,A lot...​Fcuken a lot.,4
1000qw9,whiskey,50,"If I needed to put a price 4K-5k, some cheaper bottles some expensive bottles, 5 bottles of one type",19
1000qw9,whiskey,51,"10-15k with 6 bottles costing around 1k each. I bought probably 5-6 Lagavulin 16, 3 Talisker 18, Glenmorangie Signet, some Macallan, and some randoms.",24
1000qw9,whiskey,52,"Spent over $150,000 this year and made $725,000 by reselling it all. People actually drink this stuff?",17
1000qw9,whiskey,53,After reading here I think I need to cut back...,10
1000qw9,whiskey,54,"probably 7k, but that includes insane finds I couldn't pass up. im also nowhere near the craziest I've known. I know a 60k spender..",24
1000qw9,whiskey,55,I have no clue but I have a receipt that says I spent $1400 at a drop yesterday.,18
1000qw9,whiskey,56,"26k, no really",3
1000qw9,whiskey,57,Probably $6k,2
1000qw9,whiskey,58,Approx. $10k.,2
1000qw9,whiskey,59,8k,1
1000qw9,whiskey,60,2k in the last year,5
1000qw9,whiskey,61,24 years old and live in MS,7
1000qw9,whiskey,62,Who the fuck cares,4
1000qw9,whiskey,63,Probably somewhere around 3k.... but we entertain every third weekend so that has a lot to do with it. 🤷🏻‍♂️ There were also bottle bought out of spite so that factors into it as well.,35
1000qw9,whiskey,64,Enough to make a concious decision to only bring bottles home from my monthly whiskey club meetings in 2023,19
1000qw9,whiskey,65,"Did you by inOct? Points are accelerated that month I went from 5,000 points to 30,000 of a few purchase",20
1000qw9,whiskey,66,Do those points mean anything?,5
1000qw9,whiskey,67,"Have you gotten any of the allocated bottles from them (Stagg Jr, pappy or old eagle)?",16
1000qw9,whiskey,68,"Total Wine, are you in DE/NJ area or is that a larger chain than I’m aware of?",17
1000qw9,whiskey,69,Damn you lochness monster!,4
1000qw9,whiskey,70,"$5k in a year. If I was to guess, around 40-50 bottles?",12
1000qw9,whiskey,71,"Maybe two fifths. I swear, no more than three fifths. Or four(ty)",12
1000qw9,whiskey,72,60k in a year?,4
1000qw9,whiskey,73,I know a guy who had collection of open and unopened bottles worth $75k. But that was over 10 years of buying. I am sure this dude maybe drinking close to $10k in a year since his avg bottle price was around $150.,43
1000qw9,whiskey,74,"That’s right, it’s all relative. It’s all relative. It’s all relative.",11
1000qw9,whiskey,75,Unless you spent $2k that month I’m pretty sure you lucked out on a glitch in the system,18
1000qw9,whiskey,76,Yes I bought in October but I didn't see a bump like that,13
1000qw9,whiskey,77,"Nah their point system is wack. They do Pappy and BTAC at the end of the year. I believe OFBB. Not sure what the other 2 drawings are. I know you can randomly be selected to purchase blantons but everything else is thrown on the shelf so it’s all about being at the right place at the right time. They put out OWA, EHT, Stagg Picks over the last few months at our location.",74
1000qw9,whiskey,78,"Probably somewhere in the neighborhood, but my per bottle got a bit higher this year as well. Glenmorangie signet, MWND, Bardstown Discovery, etc.",23
1000qw9,whiskey,79,That’s a Monopoly chance card IRL,6
1000qw9,whiskey,80,"Nah they have 2x, 5x, and 10x on points that month. Didn’t pay attention but mostly bourbon, seasonal beers, and wine bought. Probably spent $400 in bourbon only.",28
1000qw9,whiskey,81,Bardstown is a cool story. I stopped by there just recently for lunch and a thieving tour. Definitely looking forward to the Origin series that should be coming out soon.,30
1000qw9,whiskey,82,Your points are already 10 points per dollar,8
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,0,My new coworker said you’re not supposed to talk about wages,11
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,1,"I about had a fucking heart attack. I told her it’s a crime for employers to tell you that. She’s still in high school for fucks sake. My cool boss said that she thought it was a professional courtesy to not. And when I explained that it only benefitted the company she still wouldn’t say how much she made, but she did talk about how our director was a cheapskate and gave personal examples. I have a speech impediment, it’s mostly fine but when I get upset I stutter. I’m sure I sounded fucking insane.

You can't figure that out unless the workers talk to each other and find the pattern.",74
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,18,"You could show your coworkers the Adam Ruins Everything video on it- it’s pretty good, and utterly hilarious.",18
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,19,"We had good chuckle about the ""sexism"" in my office the other day. Every male who works for the company has a company truck. None of the females have any kind of company vehicle at all. Seems sexist on the surface. But we are an industrial service company and every technician is male (literally never had a female apply for a tech position). Every office support person is female, with the exception of the president of the company.",78
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,20,"Just because you uncover a ""pattern"" doesn't mean there isn't a legitimate reason for it. There may be illegitimate reasons, and those should be addressed. But don't be too quick to jump to conclusions.",34
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,21,"If they only hire men as technicians, and only hire women as office workers, that is most definitely a strong sign of a sexist hiring pattern. What legitimate reason is there for that? There are strong gender biases in both professions but an unbiased hiring process would reflect the actual gender percentages of the professions, not an absolute monolith. For both professions it's about 75% dominated by one gender, so what happened to the 25% of applicants that are the ""wrong"" gender? Why do they not make up 25% of your workforce?",92
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,22,"Now, I once flunked algebra in high school… but how do you hire women when 100% of your applicants are male?",21
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,23,"You don't, but again, 25% of technicians are women. If you get zero female applicants for a technician position rather than 25% that indicates a bias in the hiring/application process or perhaps some kind of external factor like a poor company reputation. This isn't so bad in its own and might just be random coincidence but not when it happens twice in one workplace. That's pushing the bounds of believability. Note also that he only specifies that for the technician position- men *do* apply for office positions, but don't ever get hired. Why could that be? When this is a company-wide problem rather than a departmental one that points to a problem with the company culture, likely sexism.",118
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,24,"Overall, just weird to notice the issue but laugh it off instead of pursuing it further.",16
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,25,"Yeah.... If I had one female applicant for a tech position, she would be given the same consideration as a male applicant. This isn't a phenomenon isolated to one company. I've been in the industrial service industry my entire adult life (I'm 41, so that's about 23 years in the industry) and have worked for a number of different companies, in different parts of the country. It's the same everywhere. Females tend not to apply for Technician positions. The strange this is (or maybe not so stramge) that this disparity doesn't seem to bother the female support staff we have. They are not in the least bit concerned with the lack of female representation amongst the service techs. The only people concerned are outside the industry, which really baffles me.",130

1001q6c,FanFiction,0,How to Promote a fanfic without coming off as annoying,10
1001q6c,FanFiction,1,"So I've been writing my fic for over a year now and while I don't post constantly I make sure to post once a month or so, maybe sooner. I've made it to the front page of my relatively small FFN crossover list and I've essentially hit a wall of readers.",51
1001q6c,FanFiction,2,"While I enjoy the story that I'm writing, my motivation usually waxes and wanes based on how much attention my story gets (also, is that normal?) I also want to get more readers and people to view the story.",39
1001q6c,FanFiction,3,"At the same time, I don't want to spread my story around like a struggle rapper with his mixtapes; how would I gain more readers in a natural, acceptable and tolerable way without being annoying?",35
1001q6c,FanFiction,4,"You can join Discord servers, subreddits or other communities for fanfic readers and writers in the fandom. Pay attention to any requests people might make (i.e. ""I want to read about X character""), and share your work if it fits the request. Talk about what you're writing if it's appropriate to the conversation. However, you should obviously engage with other people in the community for purposes other than self-promotion.",69
1001q6c,FanFiction,5,I think it's normal for your motivation to fluctuate with your engagement levels. It doesn't make you weak or inferior to writers who don't care as much about external validation.,30
1001q6c,FanFiction,6,There are a couple of things you can do that aren't super in your face.,15
1001q6c,FanFiction,7,first the more sites you post on the more folks can read your work but it can bug you if your wanting all your readers centralized in one spot.,29
1001q6c,FanFiction,8,"Second talk about your fic in appropriate context, fandom discussions about fanfic, on your social media and participate in review exchanges and other things designed for drumming up interest on this and other subs.",34
1001q6c,FanFiction,9,Three be active in your fandom by reviewing and interacting with others fics. Don't shill your own fic that's just irritating but the fact you interacted will often lead to folks clicking your user name to see what you have written and some of them will probably be interested.,49
1001q6c,FanFiction,10,"Best way is to interact with other people in your fandom, and to share your stories in spaces that are yours, or where advertising is allowed.",26
1001q6c,FanFiction,11,"Post about it on your social media and tag correctly based on the rules for whatever platform you're using. That isn't seen as annoying, because you are allowed to post whatever content to your own blog, as long as you're doing it within reason. If you're reblogging other people's works and commenting on them and just being active in the community, then advertising your stuff will be seen as adding to the community too, rather than shilling. Remember that within your fandom there is going to be a market for your stuff. You just have to put your stuff out there naturally and let *them* find it, rather than shoving it under everyone's noses.",114
1001q6c,FanFiction,12,"Do you cross-post to AO3, and any fandom-specific archives (assuming there are any)? Cross-posting can get more eyes on your page.",21
1001q6c,FanFiction,13,"Promote in the places where it's appropriate. On this subreddit, that would be Friday's Weekly Fic Showcase. Some threads let you post excerpts (""Show me your funniest scene,"" ""What's your most romantic line?"" etc.) A snippet of your writing may get someone interested. If you put your FFN and/or AO3 username in your flair, an intrigued reader can go look up your work directly.",64
1001q6c,FanFiction,14,"Other fanfiction subreddits like r/AO3 also have designated self-promo threads, although that sub is probably for AO3 users. (Another reason to cross-post.)",22
1001q6c,FanFiction,15,"With the caveats that a) it's hard to tell where your readers are coming from and b) you'll never fully know whether your promotion of your fic = more readers, as others have said: post links to the fic in the appropriate places of fannish spaces in your fandom, wherever they are. Be matter-of-fact about it and don't beg. I usually do something like, ""Hey, I posted a new fic, here's the link, go read!"" and then leave it and let it go.",83
1001q6c,FanFiction,16,"The thing about AO3 is that I really just don't like it. Nothing against those who post there, I just prefer FFN.",22
1001q6c,FanFiction,17,But yeah I'll post on threads like that and I'll promote on the weekly showcase. Thanks for the advice.,19
1001q6c,FanFiction,18,"What makes this difficult is that my story is a crossover, so it can be hard to market it to people since many of them are only interested in one fandom or the other. That, along with the crossovers being separated from the main stories means that my fix is essentially hidden from readers who don't go out of their way to look for that specific crossover category. It's frustrating.",70
1001q6c,FanFiction,19,"I write crossovers. I agree it’s twice as difficult than if you stick to a single fandom, but only in the sense you have to do twice the work. People read crossovers, especially this time of year when holiday challenges often incorporate them. Don’t let your perceived lack of audience stop you from promoting your fic. Someone will read it, trust me. It may not be two minutes from now, but speaking as someone who has been posting fanfic since 1998: someone will.",83

1002372,dating_advice,1,"A girl was interested in me during lab. I got her number, and we started texting and hanging out. We were clearly into each other as she was hinting, saying, ""All my past boyfriends were Gemini, and it's crazy that I don't give Gemini vibes."" She knew I had never dated before and was inexperienced. I made one mistake by just wishing her a happy birthday but not bringing her a gift. I only knew her for a month. I felt horrible and apologized. But she moved on and went to another guy. I feel horrible and can barely move on. Did I mess up that bad?",107

1002372,dating_advice,11,"I don't think astrology talk is cause for running, unless it dominates conversation. BUT, her moving on because you didn't bring a gift is. She's spoiled . She obviously has her expectations of a guy and that is monetary and superficial. You didn't meet that requirement so she moved on. Thank God for this. Real relationships can be hopeful for gifts but grateful for time and energy spent with them. Truthfully the way to show you care.",77
1002372,dating_advice,12,"Don't let your lack of experience make you think that you have to put up with unreasonable demands or expectations, it doesn't.",22
1002372,dating_advice,13,Na you didn’t do anything wrong and for her to be expected a gift after only knowing each other for 30 days that’s crazy. Also so just moved on to the next guy yeah she probably was already talking to him as well.,43
1002372,dating_advice,14,I doubt it was because of this,7
1002372,dating_advice,15,Dude. She’s nothing. Idk who expects a birthday presents after knowing someone for a month. But that and the zodiac talk tell me all you need to know.,28

1002372,dating_advice,23,So that probably meant she's materialistic. You dodged a bullet,10
1002372,dating_advice,24,Oh you dodged a bullet. She should have just been happy that you remembered to wish her a happy birthday. We're y'all even exclusive when her birthday rolled around or just still in the getting to knew each other phase?,40

If it was me, I wouldn't have even said happy birthday to her. If she mentioned it later, I would have just said happy belated birthday and left it at that making her wonder if I cared at all for her.",103
1002372,dating_advice,27,Let me tell you my experience as a girl..my relationship was just a month old when my long distance boyfriend’s birthday came up and I sent him a surprise gift a branded shirt..unfortunately it wasn’t the right fit but after a few months I bought him another which was more expensive…I just wanted it to be special and moreover its our first year in relationship. Then my birthday came up he didn’t give me anything. I mean I felt bad…like really bad. I mean the fact that he didn’t make the smallest effort did upset me. It doesn’t mean I’m a materialistic person. It’s just the way to show someone that you mean a lot to them…I always treat people the way I want to be treated…,127
1002372,dating_advice,28,Just to mention I’m a student and saved my pocket money to buy him something. He has a nice job and salary.,22
1002372,dating_advice,29,Anyways I didn’t leave my boyfriend but I will never ever gift him anything in future that’s for sure …,20

1002372,dating_advice,33,"It sounds like you guys might be a bit young and the connection wasn’t strong enough to continue on. I doubt her feelings completely shut down because of the gift thing, but maybe it was a small factor, like a straw that broke the camels back sort of thing. Who knows what she’s looking for in a partner. You’ll experience this at least a few times through your life. It’s best to mourn the loss but not dwell too much and move on when you’re ready. You’ll find someone else.",90
1002372,dating_advice,34,"I can see how it might have been hurtful from her perspective, as us girls analyze EVERYTHING, but that does not mean she should expect a gift. And she knows you’re not experienced—if I was in her position, I would be honored that someone trusts me enough to be their first SO. Also, if she just moved on to another guy, there’s a good chance she is lacking self-confidence and believes having a BF means she is “good enough” for someone else. I’m sorry that happened :((",87
1002372,dating_advice,35,Truly though. OP dodged a bullet on this one,9
1002372,dating_advice,36,"Indeed; OP could have been classy and bought a little inexpensive and cute token, with a nice card with something silly / funny written, like ""Happy birthday and 10E6 returns"" (if you are in some kind of science). Girls love these little things. Nobody, however, would buy an expensive gift after so little time and commitment ... if she's really so venal, OP would be better without her.",68
1002372,dating_advice,37,She went cold right after the incident that's why I'm guessing she's upset.,13
1002372,dating_advice,38,So true. The astrology shit alone is a big red flag lol,12

1002372,dating_advice,44,"Too many red flags. Brush yourself off, and ask more women out",12
1002372,dating_advice,45,Just date a ton of other girls in your school. You have to look at it in a mature way like the rest of us do. That's the whole point of dating is to find who you connect with. She'll start noticing you with other girls anyways not that that's the goal but she will probably regret. In the beginning the power of the relationship goes to who cares less. Whoever is more chill and layed back wins.,78
1002372,dating_advice,46,"It hurts because you’re in your head wondering what’s not good enough about you, what you didn’t to do right. Instead get a little realistic and think about her flaws. Was she really that great or was she just a cute girl that showed some interest in you.",48

1002382,ChineseLanguage,0,Im self teaching myself to learn chinese. Ive learned pinyin so far. Im not sure where to go from there? Grammar? Radicals? Words? Something else? A list of the order would be appreciated.,33
1002382,ChineseLanguage,1,nan,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,2,There might be links to textbooks in the sidebar. Actually you could work on characters and grammar along both lines.,20
1002382,ChineseLanguage,3,ok so you've learnt Pinyin. First of all congratulations! I'm slightly ahead of you. I apparently know 650 words and 479 characters but i still feel like I barely know anything but I have a solid routine in place. Now we can go a bit deeper:,46
1002382,ChineseLanguage,4,**Listening**,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,5,"Imo this is the core skill, especially with Chinese and it's very different sounds. The problem is that listening is very frustrating at this level. Luckily there's a good podcast in ChinesePod. They have 3 podcasts on Spotify. Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. Within each podcast the levels are split even further. [See here for more details](https://support.chinesepod.com/hc/en-us/articles/203689510-Lesson-Levels-Explained). Basically, go to the beginner podcast and start with the Newbie podcasts. Slowly work your way up the levels once you're comfortable with that level. Note, they cover grammar and vocab in these lessons but obviously no Characters.",94
1002382,ChineseLanguage,6,I recommend doing 1/2 per day. Or more if you have tons of time.,14
1002382,ChineseLanguage,7,**Characters**,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,8,"Reading is a pain in the ass because of the writing system. And if you want to do any serious reading you need to learn the characters. My recommendation is to download an SRS/Flashcard (Spaced Repetition System) App to slowly learn Hanzi. There's Anki, Pleco and Skritter. I personally use Skritter and have found great use from it. Note that to get the most out of it, you will need to pay. There are courses within it that teach you basic characters,radicals, etc and also lists from different books, textbooks and HSK Levels. If you go down this route, I recommend going through the courses in the following order: The Skritter Character Course -> Skritter Chinese 101 -> 100 Common Radicals -> HSK 1.",124
1002382,ChineseLanguage,9,I recommend learning 5 new characters/radicals per day. No more than 15/20 otherwise the reviews become overbearing,17
1002382,ChineseLanguage,10,**Reading**,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,11,"To be honest you can start before this, but I think it becomes a lot more palatable after getting through the HSK 1 skritter deck. There are a ton of HSK 1 graded readers. They are boring but with 150 words there's only so much you can do. It will allow you to combine your character knowledge with reading actual texts and really solidify your knowledge. Past this I recommend the Mandarin Companion Series, Chinese Breeze Series and Rainbow Bridge Series. You can get these as physical copies, ebooks or on the app Pleco. There's also the app DU Chinese. Du Chinese has a ton of content which you have to pay for. There's a still some free content to get through so you can hold off paying until you exhaust the free content.",134
1002382,ChineseLanguage,12,**More Structured Content/ Textbooks**,4
1002382,ChineseLanguage,13,"The above is all very unstructured learning. If you want more structure then a textbook like Integrate Chinese (IC) or New Practical Chinese Reader (NPCR) may be for you (although i still recommend doing some separate listening, reading and character learning). I personally use NPCR but I don't think you can go wrong with either. Also worth knowing that the word lists for both text books can be found in Skritter. So you can add them on Skritter before or during when you go through them.",86
1002382,ChineseLanguage,14,&#x200B;,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,15,**Summary**,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,16,In summary my routine looks like the following:,8
1002382,ChineseLanguage,17,* **Minimum - This is the minimum I force myself to do:**,12
1002382,ChineseLanguage,18,* Review all due cards for the day in Skritter,10
1002382,ChineseLanguage,19,* Go through a bit of NPCR and add all new learnt words to Skritter (20 tops! but usually around 5),21
1002382,ChineseLanguage,20,* If I have time to myself while driving/walking I will listen to a few episodes of ChinesePod,18
1002382,ChineseLanguage,21,"* If I have time to myself and I'm sitting around, I will read some graded readers and maybe add some new words to Skritter from here",27
1002382,ChineseLanguage,22,"Mobile apps are a convenient way to at least start out with a directed experience. My personal preference is SuperChinese, HelloChinese is similar. There are a number of other apps people sometimes recommend. Most of them should have at least some free content. I know both SuperChinese and HelloChinese have a pretty generous amount so you can evaluate them and see how you feel.",64
1002382,ChineseLanguage,23,"Who are you learning with? This is so crucial, because the environment you learn the language in will largely imprint on you as the “personality” of the language. Please find people you really like and are excited to learn with.",40
1002382,ChineseLanguage,24,Characters to supplement your Pinyin and grammar to teach you the structure. At the same time.,16
1002382,ChineseLanguage,25,"You don’t have to learn one after the other. Why not learn everything at the same time? Words, characters, radicals, grammar. Basically I would say focus on whichever one you are most interested in and switch when you get bored. Like for example, learning just radicals is boring. Constantly seeing them and recognizing them helps them stick",57
1002382,ChineseLanguage,26,I'm Chinese. We can communicate and learn. I'm learning English.,10
1002382,ChineseLanguage,27,Accumulate vocabulary,2
1002382,ChineseLanguage,28,Thank you for the in-depth reply ❤️,7
1002382,ChineseLanguage,29,I downloaded an app called tandem. Its an app where you meet people from the country of the language you are trying to learn. Im native in english so i help them with there english and they help with Chinese. Same goes for Spanish. I really love the app,49

10029wu,offmychest,21,Your family is going about it the wrong way but it comes from a place of love.

1002krj,Sjogrens,0,Anyone else experience changes in body odor on hydroxychloroquine?,9
1002krj,Sjogrens,1,I’ve been on hydroxychloroquine for about 6 weeks and have noticed a worse and different BO than I’ve ever experienced. In both my armpits and genitalia pits. And I still smell like used trainers right out of the shower.,39
1002krj,Sjogrens,2,So interesting. I've been on Plaquinel for a year but only in the last couple months I've been telling my husband I really stink way more than I ever did. Like if I was just working from home and not working out I could usually skip a full shower now and then but now I better shower every single day and I'm kinda funky by the days end.,68
1002krj,Sjogrens,3,I assumed it was menopause creeping in but maybe it's plaquinel?,11
1002krj,Sjogrens,4,"I'm sorry you're going through that. I haven't had that, but if it keeps up Lume is a good deodorant and you can get it in a stick or a tube so you can use it near (not on) genitals. I can get away with using no deo during the winter but when summer humidity hits, my body would reject even prescription-strength of other brands, but Lume works! I hope this passes quickly for you!",75
1002krj,Sjogrens,5,It's pricey but worth it. Fingers crossed this is a temporary thing that will go away soon!,17
1002krj,Sjogrens,6,OMG I'm not crazy! YES! I had a break off it and then started back on it and COULD NOT figure out where this smell was coming from! Husband could never smell it. I was convinced I was going nuts.,40
1002krj,Sjogrens,7,I stopped cold turkey 3 months ago. No difference whatsoever excep I have no more muscle leg pain since I stopped. I read plaquenil does nothing for Sjogren ( expect joint pain which I don’t have),36
1002krj,Sjogrens,8,"I've been on Plaquenil for over a decade now. I have very dry skin so in the winter I shower every other day only, and I still never noticed any bad smell. I also ask my partner regularly because I'm self-conscious about body odours and he honestly tells me I smell good or ""nothing"". For reference I'm in my thirties (I noticed you commented about menopause).",66
1002krj,Sjogrens,9,"I'd say a bit yes, but before I started it I was also dealing with a LOT of sensitivity in my armpits that made using any products impossible. It was really frustrating and stressful and for awhile I couldn't put anything on my armpits at all without them getting irritated immediately, I could only gently wash them with water and use my hands to apply a gentle soap.",68
1002krj,Sjogrens,10,After leaving them alone for what felt like forever I started using Lume for awhile and that worked really well for me. Now I've been on Plaquenil and I do feel like I smell more and I've tried to experiment again with other deodorants and antiperspirants but the only ones that are non irritating are Lume products. It's a bit expensive compared to what I could buy in stores but it's been the only solution I've found that helps at all.,81
1002krj,Sjogrens,11,"Interesting. I have thought that I may be peri-menopausal, but with all my new diagnoses that has fallen to the side for now. I’ll bring my stink up to my doctor and see what she has to say.",38

But mostly confused on all the paperwork needed and what the EXACT steps are. I’d most likely be buying from a private seller. What documents should I be asking to see? How would I register the car is that before or after you buy it and how? When do I look for insurance, before or after buying? What about getting it safetied? I just feel lost and I’ve tried googling it but it’s just vague answers and I just want a detailed simple to understand explanation in the correct order of what I’m supposed to do. I live in Ontario for reference.",127

1002yfo,Adulting,3,"The easiest way to buy a car is with cash through a dealership. They handle all the paperwork, and their used vehicles are certified (you're not gonna get a shit car--which is a gamble if you go through a private seller).",41

1002yfo,Adulting,5,"The very first thing is to get referrals for an honest mechanic (they do exist!). Insist upon a purchase check. If someone doesn’t want their vehicle checked out by a professional it’s a huge red flag. Also get referrals for an independent insurance agent. They will shop the carriers for you to locate the best deal. You can get coverage online pretty quickly these days, don’t drive the car for a block without it. It’s easy to switch policies then once your agent finds the best deal. We always buy from dealerships and take them to our guy for a purchase check.",102

Don’t be in a hurry and be patient for the right deal. Carfax checks are a must as well. Good luck.

1003lor,relationship_advice,1,"My boyfriend and I of 3 years broke up at the beginning of November. Was kind of dragged on because we lived together for two weeks while going to a couple's therapist to see if we could make things work, but he ultimately didn't want to, while I was still wanting to work on things. After moving back in with my parents for the time being, I moved the rest of my stuff out of his house at the beginning of this month. I found out he was already on Hinge, and had on his Hinge that he was looking for a long-term relationship, before all of my stuff was even out of his house.",115
1003lor,relationship_advice,2,"On a mutual friend's Instagram story from last night, I saw that a group of his friends all went out. My ex's ex girlfriend from college was there, who he didn't speak with during our relationship to my knowledge, other than when she texted him ""happy holidays"" during the holidays. They dated briefly again at the end of 2018, which was about 7 months before he and I got together. He told me that they wanted different things and just didn't work out as romantic partners. He was hung up on her throughout his entire young adult life and couldn't forget about her, until he dated her again. Just the fact that he went out with her and that she's hanging around friends that I thought were my friends is bad enough, but in one specific video where they were singing at the concert they went to, their faces were *really* close. Almost like they were about to kiss, or were brushing noses or something.",165
1003lor,relationship_advice,3,"I am wildly hurt. I already feel like I'm being left out of a group that I hung out with for three years, but now that he's hanging out with her, I feel like I'm being replaced. Throughout our entire relationship he always told me that he'd never had a connection as strong with anyone as he had with me, and I thought he really loved me. He seemed genuine, and I believed him. I really loved him too. Now, it feels like he's just scrambling to replace me. I had a panic attack when I saw the video, and now I just have intense anxiety that won't go away. He's having an NYE party tonight, one that I obviously wasn't invited to, but I'm heartbroken because I know that his ex will probably be there, and we used to throw an NYE party together every year when we lived together.",151
1003lor,relationship_advice,4,"It should also be said that he never deleted pictures of him with his ex, but he deleted pictures of us from his Instagram. Even after we had an argument about the pictures still being up while we were dating, and he told me ""She was a big part of my life for a while. I'm not just going to delete the pictures."" But then he took pictures of us off of his Instagram. On his Facebook they're still up, just not his instagram.",84
1003lor,relationship_advice,5,"I'm just needing insight and advice. I'm not sure how to handle this information or process it. I struggle with anxiety, and this is just too much to handle right now. I know he's not doing anything wrong, but it's making me feel extremely replaceable in his life, and I'm really hurting.",52

1004n19,GriefSupport,74,I lost my Dad in October 2020 and my Mom June 2022 My first holiday in 62 years that i have had to spend the holidays alone. Let me just say; i can burst into tears without warning. I really really miss them.,43
1004n19,GriefSupport,75,Lost my father and my mother May and June 2022. Cried my heart out during Christmas and New Year. I lived with them all my life. I did my best at work so I can spoil them. My world revolved around them. May we have more better days to come.,50
1004n19,GriefSupport,76,"My sister f(34) passed 6 weeks ago. She had cancer, but we didn't expect her to go so quickly. My partner and I just stayed in. We tried to keep ourselves busy by playing board games, as we couldn't sleep. We lit a candle for her.",46

1004n19,GriefSupport,83,"It’s been 6 years now without my mom, but New Years always hits hard because she was ADAMANT about going to Cracker Barrel and eating black eyed peas and collards and cornbread every year. Now I cook those things for myself on New Years Day and spend the day solo trying to prepare myself to make the best of the new year",62
1004n19,GriefSupport,84,"Also lost my dad 8 months ago couple of days before my birthday, doing the same as you nothing much to celebrate..trying to move forward but every single holidays coming towards the end of the year being the first for everything really sucks",43
1004n19,GriefSupport,85,My fiancé was February 2021. Holidays are hard. Thanksgiving was a gut punch because his birthday sometimes falls on it. I spent a majority of the “holiday season” working.,29
1004n19,GriefSupport,86,I lost my grandpa less than 24 hours ago due to covid. I thought we had more time and that he would make it into the new year. Ended up here because I’m feeling completely lost and dumb. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore,47

1004n19,GriefSupport,91,"My dad died of heart attack 2 months ago. Despite feeling really gutted about holidays, my family decided to have a small dinner which my sister hosted. It was sad but we talk about random stuff and we sometimes reminisce things what would dad do or how he would've reacted on certain things that happened recently. It kinda alleviated the sadness.",61
1004n19,GriefSupport,92,"We tried to keep busy and just enjoyed good food, company, and stories. We made it through holiday albeit trying way too hard to get through. I just hope the next holidays will be better.",35
1004n19,GriefSupport,93,"My mom died last May. Was expecting christmas to be hard, and it was. Spent last night with friends thinking it would be okay, but my boyfriend had to work so I was there by myself. And somewhere around 12:15 while watching the fireworks it suddenly hit me that this would be a whole year of things she wouldn’t see and know and experience and I had to stop myself from physically running away.

1004n19,GriefSupport,96,"Being strong means surviving another day without them. The first year is always the hardest. I'm at my second year and I'm handling it much better. You will too, give it time. I keep reminding myself what my mom would want for me - to spend the day crying or to live a good life. So i do what I must to not worry her and to make her proud so that one day when I see her she can be happy and proud. That's what keeps me going.",89

1004n19,GriefSupport,99,"I lost him this year nov 20th in the middle of the holiday season. I am continuing the legacy that is them, as they live through me. Taking each step to assure the safety of the home we built together by caring for myself or the family. They were my fiance to be married next year. I sit I work and cry as I crawl towards our goals while I still have time. Nothing comes from nothing and nothing is easy. Today I rest so I can keep fighting. Good luck on your saga.",94
1004n19,GriefSupport,100,"My mom died 27th of November. I wasn't close with her and I had troubled past with her. I had already cut ties with her and learnt to live without her. Despite that, I felt horrible for few weeks. Now I feel fine and I am living my normal life. I feel horrible for getting over it so soon. Sometimes a memory of her pops up and I feel wave of sadness and pain. I can say I miss her. However, I have accepted her passing and I am okay with it.",92
1004n19,GriefSupport,101,My dad died in spring 2021. I actually spent Christmas of that year alone because of Covid. It weirdly made it easier as I knew my mum didn’t want to do anything.,32
1004n19,GriefSupport,102,This is the second year without him and we’ve done more this time around actually. I don’t know if that helps.,21
1004n19,GriefSupport,103,I think it will always be a difficult time of year for loss. I think however you want to process it is up to you. Don’t feel any obligations. I’ve thought seriously about going away next Christmas to process the holiday season as I want to. Love to you.,49
1004n19,GriefSupport,104,"It will never be the same without my Mom. This is the 3rd holiday season without my Mamma. I feel as each year goes by I’m leaving her further & further behind. Losing my Dad 29 years ago was very hard… but loosing Mom, the pain is on a whole other level. 💔",53
1004n19,GriefSupport,105,"I lost my Mother on New Year's Day 2022. This is the anniversary of her death. And the best way to deal with it, for me, is to not deal with it at all.

I’ve had more crying jags than I m willing to remember today, yesterday, this month. I can’t sit and just mourn- it’s not physically possible for me (something is wrong, I don’t sit still mentally or physically). I’m grieving with you- mine just looks different.

1004n19,GriefSupport,111,"Everyone's grief is different. Grieve as you are grieving for as long as you want. Grief never goes away, nor would you want it to.

It will be a year in February since I lost my oldest child & son. Everyday since he transitioned has been of 1sts, all over again, only now without him.

I even sometimes dream about ordinary things. People call me ""Ma'am"" whenever, even with no makeup on. I'm not a beautiful woman, but I don't care, that's not why I was there in the first place.

That’s not their responsibility and it’s not something they will ever be successful at. That constant push and pull of being damned if they do and damned if they don’t will shape them in all the wrong ways and teach them to put up with things they shouldn’t in their relationships.

Children feel responsible for their parents’ behavior and if they see her crying and unable to be consoled, they will think they have done something to make her behave that way.

I learned how to recognize poor thought patterns and behaviors, how to change those behaviors and my life improved greatly over the next few years. Now I don't want to kill myself every day, I've learned when and how to assert myself, my career has taken off and I have developed good long term friendships and relationships. She needs help to get there and you need help to learn how to support her effectively.",149
1005sp9,relationship_advice,55,"Don't waste a day. Talk to her. Get her friends and family to encourage her to take action. It may be the hardest thing she ever does (it was for me) but its worth it in the end. If she doesn't understand or believe its the right thing to do, have an intervention (learn how by googling ""How to have an intervention"") and talk to to her about your concerns. Tell her you are worried about her. Tell her the situation isn't sustainable and is deeply effecting your relationship. Listen to her then ask her to trust you and get help.

This is no different than if she felt a lump on her breast or had extreme knee pain that kept her from walking. Problems have solutions but only if you face them and seek help. Facing things may not be her strength right now but if she trusts you she can still get help.",122

unknown,unknown,1,There’s a chance depending on type grade mutations how much they take out. They generally always come back but people can go 30 years and maybe even longer and even when you figure out the type and stuff they base it on statistics and there are outliers but I would say there’s a good chance you’ll make it to fifty at the same time I am being hopeful low grade is good that’s generally a grade 2 but they won’t truly know until they open you up. I’m 34 I have Oligodendroglioma grade 2 and had my operation back in sept 27th I have an idh1 mutant so all those are in my favor but I do believe it’s possible for it to start growing even a year after treatment as I’ve seen someone else in this subreddit have that happen but odds are I’ll probably make it to fifty or even sixty,153

unknown,unknown,7,Thank you!,2
unknown,unknown,8,Listen to your doctors. Seek second opinions. You don’t get a diagnosis until you have had surgery to send brain tissue to a pathologist. Then starts the process of understanding your diagnosis and what further steps you’d take to have as normal a life as possible.,46

1006dn1,CrestedGecko,10,"Existential angst? I don’t know, but they make noises with purpose. It’s risky for prey animals like cresties to draw attention to themselves, so when they make noises, they are trying to communicate something. They especially don’t hiss for fun.",40

z98394,TravelNursing,0,Anyone have trouble negotiating contracts?,5
z98394,TravelNursing,1,Hey all! I have been traveling for about 1.5 years and have gotten relatively decent contracts but I have come to realize that my agency does not really let me negotiate much and usually tells me to talk to the manager after I sign.,44
z98394,TravelNursing,2,"For example, I am being offered a contract now with the pay range at the absolute lowest of the bracket given. I brought this up and was basically shot down immediately saying the contract listing stated the pay range before I said I was interested and that the quoted offer falls in this range (by $5).",56
z98394,TravelNursing,3,"I asked if I could have a clause that included block scheduling as my plan is to get a long term AirBnB with the option of being able to drive home some days that I am not working, having recently bought a house and having house projects to do (about 7 hours one way). My agency basically said they cannot guarantee that and I would have to talk to the manager, but go ahead and sign because I only have 24 hours.",82
z98394,TravelNursing,4,"I was then further told that I really should not be declining offers based on pay, location, or shift as all of that is laid out upfront. My issue being that the pay is a broad range and the shift just stating like 3x12 but no guarantee if it is one off, one on or what.",56
z98394,TravelNursing,5,"So all that being said, does anyone have any experience with the same or tips regarding this? I actually do not mind the location of this contract offer, it is a smaller hospital so could be an interesting change from my normal. I am just more worried that I want to ask for a block-style schedule and my recruiter is basically saying sign now, ask later, and then what if “later” comes along and the manager says they cannot offer that.",81
z98394,TravelNursing,6,Give yourself an emergency fund so you can afford to be patient and picky.,14
z98394,TravelNursing,7,Find another recruiter and leverage them against each other. Especially bigger agencies will try to lower your rates because they’re usually still higher than smaller agencies.,26
z98394,TravelNursing,8,But go to the second recruiter anyway and be like if they can just match and give me xyz you’d be surprised what you can get out of it.,29
z98394,TravelNursing,9,I feel like its been a lot more difficult to get things added into contracts like block scheduling or patient limits when floated etc. They don't budge on their pay either. Things are changing I guess.,36
z98394,TravelNursing,10,"So, the block scheduling thing, you should discuss that with the manager prior to an offer even being made (unless it's an auto offer). The manager should either agree or disagree. If they agree, then it should be written into the contract, as it's a pre-approved stipulation.",47
z98394,TravelNursing,11,"The only way I've negotiated was by waking away from an offer for a better one. Tried asking nicely, tried showing what other travelers were making, tried to initiate a back and forth with recruiter/hospital but nope.",37
z98394,TravelNursing,12,The negotiation should happen before an offer letter is signed...even before you send them credentialing - that’s when you have the power. If your agency really seems averse to negotiation; I would reconsider if that’s the best relationship for you.. Many nurses have multiple agencies they’re in contact with; could be a great route for you.,56
z98394,TravelNursing,13,"it has been harder...more of a 'take it or leave it' attitude from the agencies it seems. Unfortunately, they want loyalty on the back-side but don't really seem to do anything to earn it. My recruiter from previous gig liked to say stuff like 'I fight for you' and 'always here for you' but was getting crap offers from dumpster fires. She's sorta given me the cold shoulder since I took a better offer from a different agency. However, current agency gives all the 'corporate' responses when ever try to negotiate... even tho the hospital says their rates haven't changed. Extension has a slight bump in hourly but OT rate dropped a good bit. Next contract gonna be up for grabs!",121
z98394,TravelNursing,14,I did have a decent emergency fund built up but recently put a bit into buying a house so slowly building it back up.,24
z98394,TravelNursing,15,"I do think getting a second recruiter could be beneficial though! My last 2 contracts have been in the lower half of the pay range, so having some leverage in regards to that and helping with scheduling could be beneficial!",40
z98394,TravelNursing,16,"I’m just having a harder time with this contract especially since the rate is actually lower than I was making as staff, without accounting for stipend of course.",28
z98394,TravelNursing,17,"Yeah it seems like a lot is changing! I’ve normally been very open about my schedule, usually tell them I’ll do my best to work what they need. I just normally ask if they can to try to block them for me as it helps with arrangements with classes and stuff, but I am flexible in that I will work with them as much as I can. This is the first time I specifically requested to add it into my contract.",81
z98394,TravelNursing,18,"Good to know! So of the contracts I’ve done, I think I have spoken to a manager twice before the offer. Most of the time, I guess they are auto offers (at least in my case)? I definitely didn’t speak with anyone this go around.",45
z98394,TravelNursing,19,"Don’t loot at the rate, look at the whole weekly pay. If that’s enough, take it. I always have an amount in mind that I won’t go under.",28
z98394,TravelNursing,20,"There are not as many contracts out there now, which means you have less room to negotiate.",17
z98394,TravelNursing,21,Hourly rates being lower than staff rates are common. The stipend is where the real money is made,18
z98394,TravelNursing,22,"You can still ask your agency for a contact number to discuss these things prior. Unless the listing specifies that it's an auto offer, you have no way of knowing if you'll talk to someone before signing. So if that's the case, then you're well within rights to turn things down.",51
z98394,TravelNursing,23,Thanks again! I may see if I can get a contact number! I would definitely love to speak with someone about their scheduling before signing.,25

z998dc,subaru,1,"Hello everyone, I'm looking to purchase a remote start kit for my girlfriends 2020 STI for the holidays. I'm not too familiar with foreign cars, and I know subies can be kind of picky with modifications so I want to make sure I get her the right one.",48

z998dc,subaru,5,\+1 for the compustar system. the way theirs works is actually pretty failsafe for stick cars in general. getting their pro T13 installed on monday myself on my 17 wrx,30
z998dc,subaru,6,Can I ask why manuals aren't recommended for Remote startups? Is it something to do with the clutch not being pressed down?,22
z998dc,subaru,7,Correct! All cars are equipped with a neutral safety switch and all modern manual vehicles have a safety feature which requires the clutch to be pressed in to be started. Also a good rule of thumb for manual vehicles is to put your car into 1st gear with the park brake enabled.,52

z999ap,Bend,1,"My mom's car got a notice and I need to move it, but it won't jump and we don't have the money to repair it. Am I allowed to push it up the street or will Bend Police department be dicks about it.",43
z999ap,Bend,2,"Notices about towing are complaint driven. According to the cop who I talked to when ours was given a notice after 12 hours of sitting there. New neighbors apparently call on anyone in front of their house. So if some one does call again, they will probably enforce it. If you park it in the other direction you could argue it was moved but that will only buy you a few days.",72
z999ap,Bend,3,"You're taking a big chance just moving it a few feet. I had a car tagged once and when I called Bend PD saying that I was concerned about driving and then parking it back in the same space, I was told that as long as I had driven it ""a few miles"" they would be able to determine that and I would be fine. How they determine how far it is driven, I don't know.",76
z999ap,Bend,4,"I don't know how you see this as Bend PD being ""dicks"". Folks were fed up with people storing nonoperational cars on the street and the city did something about it by passing the ordinance saying that you can't stay parked in the same place for more than 72 hours.",50
z999ap,Bend,5,"You can also remove the battery and take to Autozone or whatever for a charge, if it will take one. I believe no cost.",24
z999ap,Bend,6,"Also might see if there is a shop that has a tender with repair mode. I own one that has revived a few different “permanently dead” batteries. Not sure if that’s a thing, but also kind of a plug for the NOCO 10. I love that thing.",47
z999ap,Bend,7,Just pull it with another car. Seen people doing that last week down a busy street,16
z999ap,Bend,8,City's Traffic Code does not allow a vehicle to be parked on a city street for longer than **72 hours.**,20

z999ap,Bend,10,I started mine once by pouring Dr. Pepper on the battery connections. Then replacing said connections after driving to the O.O.O...O'Reilly.,21
z999ap,Bend,11,"Edit to add: this is totally true story but actually probably the worst advice on this thread, other than to check / clean / or replace the connections and get down to an auto parts store for some diagnostics of the battery and maybe some repair parts as others have mentioned.",51
z999ap,Bend,12,Check and clean the battery connections. If the car has been sitting and you can’t turn it over with a full battery or a jump start corrosion might be the issue.,31
z999ap,Bend,13,"If that doesn’t work, tap on the starter motor while cranking with a piece of wood or a rubber mallet. Sometimes they get stuck and just need a little jostle to turn over.",33
z999ap,Bend,14,"Sounds like you have a dick/ Karen neighbors that is a cop caller. Yes you can push the car but you also need figure what neighbor is the spineless cop caller that is afraid to talk to their own neighbors, and would rather waste police resources on vehicles parked in front of your house.",54
z999ap,Bend,15,"You'll want to look up the specific city parking code to determine how far it needs to go. I haven't looked at Bend's but most cities will say something like ""cannot be parked on the same block"". Non-operational vehicles usually have their own constraints. Instead of 72 hours you may only be able to park it in one place for 24.",61

I feel like my dr isn’t being aggressive enough with my dosage and I’m wasting time. I don’t get how it’s not even going down at all but going up.

z99wqq,relationship_advice,0,I gave my students my phone number but was that wrong/creepy?,11
z99wqq,relationship_advice,1,"Throwaway since I(28F) dont want this connected to anything. I have been an ESL teacher for a year and really enjoyed teaching my students(kindergarten- elementary) I certainly think I lacked some professionalism, however I dont know if I went i was totally inappropriate by what I did. When I was being trained by the leaving teacher I noticed how all the kids seemed to know she was leaving and said goodbye to her on the last day. I just took mental stock of that and said in my head its normal for teachers to tell kids they're leaving before they go. So as my Contract comes to an end i tell my everyday kids im leaving. Some parents called in and asked about it so my boss got annoyed and told me to not say anything anymore and she would tell the rest of the kids when i was leaving. That never happened so the younger kids probably don't know what happened but it did eventually spread around so that most of the older kids new.",176
z99wqq,relationship_advice,2,"Those older kids asker when I was going back to America and I was confused and just told them im not as i planned to be in this country for many years, maybe my whole life. After that they kept asking again and again for my number and I would brush it off. At that time i was brushing it off i also met with a friend native to that country and he mentioned how he was having lunch with his grade school teacher the next day. I was surprised and asked if it was common for people to do that here (since it's not really a thing in america) and he said it's not ""common"" but not ""uncommon"" either. After that I asked a teacher native to this country if it's not allowed to give out my number to students. She said it's uncommon but not ""not allowed' so i just kind of sat on that for a while.",160
z99wqq,relationship_advice,3,"So after my kids kept asking eventually I told them we can make a deal. Ask your parents and If its OK then you can have my number. Some kids came back and said their parents said its OK with a note, some didnt and I didnt want to call them liars so I gave the ones with notes my number as I promised. Today (my contract has ended atleast a week now) my boss called and asked why I did that and I told her the truth of why. She told me it was stressing her out and kept asking why I did it and I just kept repeating why. She then told me not to pick up if any parents call and to never do that again as it causes stress for the teachers left behind. I really didn't imagine it was a big deal because of the responses I got from friend and coworker but now I wonder if I was wrong or if this comes off in a bad way. Maybe the kids did lie in the end to get my number so now I feel bad about what's happened. does anyone have any insight?",199

z99xdc,transgenderUK,3,"What do I mention, what don't I mention? What is most likely to get me an appointment. Do I mention that my gender dysphoria is distracting me from things I enjoy and need to do, because that's the truth. I'm sure this is me just over thinking (as I normally do) I just fear rejection and wanted to make sure I don't make any mistakes before I submit the form. Anything specific about Gender Doctors/ Dr Kirpal Sahota would be helpful too.",82
z99xdc,transgenderUK,4,"Be honest, but don't stress too much, one of the upsides of private care is they are a business at the end of the day so they will look for reasons to accept you as a patient rather than reasons to turn you away.",44
z99xdc,transgenderUK,5,"Just tell the truth. If the clinic is competent, they will understand and know you’re trans based on your honest experiences. There’s not really a way to make a mistake in it as long as you’re being truthful that’s all they want to see",44
z99xdc,transgenderUK,6,"I was worried before my private appointment after hearing all the horror stories from people who went the NHS route, but the doctor I saw at Gender Care was really nice. There are questions they have to ask to tick boxes but they're not trying to catch you out.",49
z99xdc,transgenderUK,7,When you're paying hundreds of pounds for an hour long consultation there's a lot more incentive for the doctor to actually help you so you're more likely to recommend them to other people.,33

z99xdc,transgenderUK,12,"i also made sure to avoid any of the things that the WPATH SOC suggested could prevent transition - principly make sure that my mental health issues looked well managed, or however they put it.",35
z99xdc,transgenderUK,13,"the rest was a couple of general mental health multi-part quizes I think. they are generic, so could be researched and again, just look stable.",25
z99xdc,transgenderUK,14,LTC forms were mostly factual so that was just entered as is. including them having a copy of my records sent from the GP i think...,26
z99xdc,transgenderUK,15,"Yeah Gender Care is my back up, just in case I don't get an appointment with Gender Doctors but I've had a search around reddit and it seems that I will likely get an appointment with them since I've not seen a single post from someone who hasn't (it may take a few tries though). That put me at ease but still very nervous and the wait times for endocrinologist are going to be painful (though less so than waiting for NHS)",82
z99xdc,transgenderUK,16,"Yeah, lucky for me most my mental health has gotten better. Less anxious, less depressed. Nothing really that couldn't be linked to gender dysphoria.",24

z99zub,trans,0,Anyone have experience transitioning in quebec montreal?,7
z99zub,trans,1,I want to start transitioning but im not sure where so was wondering if anyone who already has started can help me,22
z99zub,trans,2,"Yes! I began transitioning in June of 2021. You're in luck, because Montreal is probably one of the best places to be trans in the world.",26
z99zub,trans,3,"When I finally came out to myself, I first reached out to a therapist who had experience with trans issues and the Montreal queer community, and she was able to give me some great advice. If you're not seeing a therapist, I do recommend it - it helped me immensely. They can be really good resources.",56
z99zub,trans,4,The below is primarily relevant if you are over 18.,10
z99zub,trans,5,"If you are considering medically transitioning, know that Quebec is an informed consent province, which means that you do not require therapy prior to being prescribed hormones, so long as you are not a minor. Nor do you require an endocrinologist, specifically, to prescribe HRT. You'll go in for a consultation and they'll go over the basics. I do recommend doing research into HRT first, just so you can go in somewhat prepared with any questions/concerns. (Note that, unlike HRT, surgeries, you will typically require letters from therapists.)",88
z99zub,trans,6,"I initially started at Clinique l'Actuel, which is public, but unfortunately, my doctor migrated to a private clinic (Clinique A/Centre DGL Hormonotherapie). You may have to face some wait times, so it's worth reaching out to a few places.",39
z99zub,trans,7,These are the clinics that were recommended to me when I first started (I believe they're all public?):,18

unknown,unknown,3,"Oh, I should also note that I've been socially transitioning for just about a year, and I've never had any issues here (though it helps that I'm mainly downtown, and I still mask a lot in public due to Covid concerns). I've never had any trouble at any CLSC, hospital, SAAQ outlet, store or anything. I've even taught classes, and nobody raises an eyebrow.",64
unknown,unknown,4,There are a lot of resources available in this city due to the fact that we have such a large and vibrant queer community.,24

unknown,unknown,6,[deleted],1
unknown,unknown,7,"So they aren't going to pry into your financial situation. You'll just meet up with a doctor and go over the process. Explain to them that you're trans and that you want to start HRT. They'll go over the details, and you can ask any questions you have. You might want to look into benefits, risks, timelines, and administration methods beforehand. They'll send you off for some initial blood work, which you can get done at a CLSC (it won't cost you anything). The appointment at the clinic shouldn't' cost anything, or if it does, it'll be a small administrative fee (I think I had to pay $10).",108
unknown,unknown,8,"If you do end up opting for HRT and get a prescription, you will have to pay for the hormones, though fortunately, a chunk of the cost is covered by RAMQ. In my case, I started off with estradiol (estrogen) and spironolactone (anti-androgen). I've since added progesterone, and my pharmacy bill is between $35 and $38 per month for the three drugs.",62
unknown,unknown,9,"I don't know how long the waiting list is for either clinic, so I would advise reaching out to both of them. If you do get an appointment with one of them, you can always let the other clinic know that you no longer need their services, but at least this way you'll be seen the soonest possible.",58

z9aek2,AskDocs,2,"2 weeks ago, I was working a shift serving, 8 hours when at the end i had a sudden neck pain that was making me dizzy, especially looking down or side to side. My fiancés sister drove me home after I vomited into a trash can from the pain.",49
z9aek2,AskDocs,3,"When I got home, i presumed it was a migraine since I had one earlier the week prior and found soaking my feet in hot water helped. I ended up puking into the tub and just laying on the floor crying and continuously vomiting from the pain which made the pain throb in the back of my neck worse. The pain would radiate back and forth between the back of my neck to my front temples, throbbing pain and no relief from tylenol.",83
z9aek2,AskDocs,4,"My partner concerned tried to help me into our bedroom and I was fighting him since I knew the pain would be unbearable if I got up, but he helped me up, got me ice, and gave me unisom. I woke up multiple times from the pain. I got myself a glass of water thinking it was dehydration and immediately vomited it up and woke up my partner to let him know I needed to go to the ER, something wasn't right.",82
z9aek2,AskDocs,5,"We wait 4 hours to be seen, the entire time I have my neck cranked on the back of the chair because having it forward alone caused pain. They do labs, give me a lidocaine patch, some tylenol, and an IV with zofran added, and while I didn't feel great, the pain was bearable. I go home, take a nap, wake up to the same pain I had prior. I just wanted to cry.",74
z9aek2,AskDocs,6,"It took 4 days for the pain to complete subside. I took 3 off of work to rest and use a heating pad, but every time I turned my head I felt the same pulsation of pain that makes me wince and feel like I will pass out.",48
z9aek2,AskDocs,7,"Went last week feeling fine, worked another 8 hour shift yesterday and could feel it coming on, so I took tylenol to try to get ahead of it, but it was no use. I immediately used the heating pad at home to help, but it didn't much. If there wasn't pain in my neck I had that awful throbbing headache. Again woke up throughout the night from the neck pain and headache.",72
z9aek2,AskDocs,8,"I wake up this morning, and snow had fallen heavy, but we figured we had to work. My fiance did his stuff while i took tylenol again, put on a lidocaine patch, and hoped i could bear through the pain. Thanktully we closed the restaurant so i was able to go back home, but my neck still hurts to look side to side, and my headache has been relentless unless I am sleeping.",73
z9aek2,AskDocs,9,"Is there anything I can do for relief? I'm on limited state healthcare for pregnancy and am already anticipating a large ER bill, but I am unsure of who to reach out to for help.

She asked me if they could stay at my house last night because I live 20 minutes away from the airport versus their apartment being an hour away from it (or more depending on traffic). I don't drink caffeine so I don't have a coffeemaker. This morning her boyfriend was so angry about there not being coffee that he threw a plate at my head. My sister excused him by saying that he's a ""caffeine addict"" and that he gets ""cranky"" without his coffee like that makes it all right. And she's angry at me for saying he's not welcome at my house now. I can't believe he thinks it is acceptable to do that. I asked my sister if he's ever done anything like that to her and she asked if I was calling him an abuser and got angry at me.",154

z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,6,Have an intervention for her.,5
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,7,The fact that she defended him is possibly a bigger flag than his behaviour. It would appear very likely that this is normal behaviour for him.,26

z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,23,Thats assault.,2
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,24,"Use the correct words. Its not clear whether it hit or not, so he either assaulted you, or attempted to assault you. Ask your sister why you'd ever welcome back into your home someone who thinks its acceptable to assault you because they're cranky.",44

z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,41,Time to go no contact for both of them. Sorry this happened.,12
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,42,So he threw a plate at your head for not having a coffee maker. I’d be even more on earned at what he’s doing to her behind closed doors when he doesn’t get his way.,35
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,43,The dude sounds like a piece of shit and your sister sounds like an enabler. I'm glad it was just one night.,22
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,44,I like how she was the one to use the word “abuser” when you asked if his behavior was consistent. And then she was mad that you cared about what she would label as abuse if it happened to her.,40
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,45,"I wish I cared more about her outcomes, but you can’t fix this sort of thinking for her, and it’s probably not going to happen of her own volition for years, likely once there are children involved. I hope he’s impotent, I guess. It would be best to let her know that you’ll be around if she leaves and then focus on other things until that day.",67
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,46,If he hadn't done that he will. That is never ok.,11
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,47,Don’t let him in your house. Don’t go near him again.,11
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,48,I’m so sorry but your sister is definitely in an abusive relationship. She is just not ready to see it. But now you do so maybe that will help.,29

z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,54,"My mom, my dad and I are all caffeine addicts and none of us have thrown objects at each other because we were ""cranky for coffee"". The man's behaviour is ludicrous and so is your sisters justification of it. I'd give her an ultimatum since she clearly loves living in denial.",51
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,55,"Yea I drink caffeine every day and I’ve never assaulted someone because I didn’t have it, he isn’t an addict he’s just a piece of shit. I’m really tired of people using addictions as an excuse to act shitty",39

z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,65,Neither my sister or her asshole would be allowed in my house after that.,14
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,66,What the fuck.,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,67,The fact that your sister got defensive when you asked if he had ever done that to her means yes he has 100% done that to her and she's normalized it.,31

z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,76,"Sounds like someone is protecting an abuser. I'm guessing they've been together for a while, and she doesn't want to leave a long term relationship? What do your parents/siblings have to say on the matter? I'm kind of surprised you didn't call police on him, that's vandalism, destruction of private property, and assault (at least in my state)",58
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,77,"Oh, she is being abused!!! Maybe not physically, yet, but surely some emotional or psychological abuse. Her quick defense of his actions without a true apology, and her anger at the mention of it are telltale signs.",37

I can go on and on about how it was used for religious purposes at one point or how first-wave coffee culture helped us recover from the Great Depression in the US, how Starbucks contributed to second-wave coffee culture, and why I choose a third-wave approach to both roasting and brewing. I like going to coffee shops and sampling their coffee and guessing which country the beans came from. Like. I’m hardcore into coffee.",77
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,82,This isn’t someone being a caffeine addict. This is just someone being an asshole.,14

z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,85,caffeine is not cocaine. its not that addicting. the guy is just a violent piece of shit.,17
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,86,i drink coffee. its not very addicting. I drink cause i like the warmth in the morning. i can easily got weeks without having it.,25
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,87,Yup she's abused,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,88,"Wow, This is about coffee, But that idiot guy is going on like he's a heroine addict, Also make sure he isn't abusing your sister, And if he shouts alot, Get a bigger guy to go have a chat with that little boy.",43
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,89,"He is an abuser throwing a plate at someone bc they don’t own a coffee maker is deranged and abusive. You need to tell your family, your sister is most likely in an abusive relationship based on how she excused his horrid behavior",43
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,90,What a fucking man child I'm sure he's done shit like that to your sister and that is ridiculous. you are in the right to not have him over at your home anymore.,33
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,91,What is with all of these crybaby men who flip out and start throwing stuff when they get angry? The situation you described is really concerning. I hope your sister will come to her senses and realize this type of thing could and likely will increasingly escalate. I applaud you for being as calm and level headed as you were.,60
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,92,He probably hits her as well. ☹️,7
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,93,You need to check that dude. There’s disagreements and then there’s just being disrespectful. If you don’t take care of it now it will get worse.,26
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,94,"Honestly, I’d press charges if you can. Though I imagine your sister, the only witness, would lie to the cops when interrogated. Post this to your main account bc she needs to see that no, this isn’t him being “cranky” (is he a fucking toddler?!?!), it’s abuse.",47
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,95,>I asked my sister if he's ever done anything like that to her and she asked if I was calling him an abuser and got angry at me.,28
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,96,"Ok, so atleast your sister is not 100% delusional and realizes that plate throwing falls under abusive behavior.",18
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,97,">My sister excused him by saying that he's a ""caffeine addict"" and that he gets ""cranky"" without his coffee",19
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,98,So he's so much of an addict that he has no control over his own actions?? And your sister is ok with that.,23
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,99,"I would advise you to be kind to your sister and provide her with a safe place should she want to leave him. He may not have thrown things at her but he is definitely abusive to her in other ways, and she can't leave.",45
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,100,Hed be out on the street the same minute he threw my property to my head inside my own house.,20
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,101,Insane stuff.,2
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,102,"Well, if it throws a plate like an abuser...",9
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,103,Don't even talk to the prick at family events what a garbage person,13
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,104,That's messed up. I am a caffeine addict myself but I have never thrown any objects because I couldn't get a fix.,22
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,105,And there should be plenty of ways for him to get coffee without resorting to violence.,16
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,106,Fuck that guy!,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,107,He might be abusive and your sister is still in denial. Do not let him back in your house again. Remain firm. And keep an eye on your sister for bruises or anything else that could indicate he’s hurting her.,40
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,108,"Damn, he’s normalized this behavior that he was comfortable enough to do it to you, in your own house. Tell other family members and help her get iut of there",30
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,109,Yeah he's kicking her azz. You did the right thing. If sis is pissed she should stay the hell away too. What sister allows her immature boy toy to act so aggressively towards her own sister ?,37
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,110,Your sister is 100% being abused and she's in the idiot phase of it now - which is denial. Tell your family ASAP. I would also report him.,28
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,111,Your sister is regarded,4
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,112,Yeah that right there is assault. A crime. Tell your sister neither of them are ever allowed back there and should be more grateful you didn't press charges because I would have,32
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,113,"She's probably being abused herself, and in denial about it (thus the question of ""are you calling him an abuser?""). You're absolutely justified in not allowing him around you any more - that was in no way acceptable.",38
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,114,"I'm sorry that you're going through that - I hope you can stay in contact with your sister. She'll probably need it. If he's comfortable enough to do something like that around you, imagine how he acts around her. It might be worth it to ask her who else is calling him an abuser - but make sure she knows that you love her and are going to be there for HER, just not HIM. He may already be trying to isolate her from her support network. After all, that's what abusers do.",93
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,115,"Stay safe, OP.",3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,116,"""I'm withdrawing from my socially accepted addiction so I have a pass yo assault you.""",15
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,117,Fuck. That.,2
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,118,"If the sister is rationalizing that type of behavior… eek. She’s either as bad as him or is desensitized because he always is like this/abuses her (the latter feels more likely). That is a level ten reaction to a non-infraction. I hope you’re okay, OP.",45
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,119,"Holy shit if he has the gumption to do this to you, imagine what he’s doing to your sister behind closed doors. This is not cranky. This is abusive and batshit crazy.",32
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,120,Thays beyond being cranky about not getting caffeine. That was a tantrum how big a deal would it be to just go get some at a gas station or something?,30
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,121,Call it what it is. He's physically abusive.,8
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,122,He’s an abuser,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,123,Dude...,1
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,124,I mean you're so in the right I don't have much to add except I'm worried about your sister,19
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,125,"Get a fucking coffee maker, not rocket science",8
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,126,"This was my first thought too. There are plenty of places to grab coffee. Hell, the airport will have it if you don't pass one of the other dozen places you can buy a cup on the way.",38
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,127,Should have called the police for assault.,7
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,128,That definetly is abusive behaviours.,5
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,129,I also get cranky when I don\`t get coffee in the morning. You know what I do? I would look if I could get one somewhere else and if not I sulk inside myself for like 5 minutes and then I get over it and move on.,47
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,130,Yup she got Stockholm,4
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,131,"Yup. She didn’t answer the question with “No, never!”, she answered it with another question. Way to dance around the obvious.",21
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,132,"OP, you need to make yourself available to sister if ever she needs help getting away.",16
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,133,Exactly. The bf is an abusive idiot and there is a big chance the sister is in denial of being abused. Could help to open her eyes.,27
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,134,She's an abuse victim a d I'd be surprised if he doesn't already beat her,15
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,135,"Me too, except privately...no coffee means I have a legitimate excuse to go out for expresso. Out of milk? Guess I'll need to pop out and grab a cappuccino!",29
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,136,"My first thought, too. Like how many people’s sister’s boyfriends have thrown plates at their heads for the lack of a coffeemaker? Can’t be more than half a dozen. I think sister may make the connection here…",37
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,137,Missing the point here,4
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,138,Damn bro completely over your head huh 🤔,8
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,139,Possibly assault with deadly force. A lot of states consider blunt force trauma to the head the same level of deadly force as shooting someone.,25
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,140,I thought the exact same thing.,6
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,141,100% this make them late for the flight,8
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,142,"Sulk inside myself - hilarious, I’m taking it",8
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,143,I sulk when I run out of coffee too.,9
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,144,"Nah, that was the plate that got thrown at her for NOT HAVING A COFFEE MACHINE",16
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,145,Yeah it sucks..,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,146,Happy cake day!,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,147,Lol but why would she have one if she doesn’t drink coffee?,12
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,148,To avoid getting plates thrown at her head.,8

z9ajyp,stepparents,2,"I (f 28) have established a life, career, and bought a house in a small community. I'm a bit tired of it but I have a great job. I started dating my partner (m 31) 2 years ago. We've had our troubles but we love each other and have a pretty great partnership.",53
z9ajyp,stepparents,3,"Issues: we are both pretty emotional, dominate people. We are busy. We sometimes struggle to communicate. We both struggle with anxiety and depression. HCBM. SD is kind of annoying to me but we get along great. I'm struggling with my attraction to him and sometimes feel like I could do better. Ie partner without kids and a psycho ex wife, someone that is less emotional, things like that. He can be snappy. He used to yell at me but he's made the adjustment. I feel like he works hard for me but we've also had trouble and I've been uncertain many times. It's created some tumultuousness but we keep growing and getting better. We both have trauma. There's a lot.",120

z9ajyp,stepparents,6,HCBM is just.... HCBM. She's a raging jerk and tries to control our household and tell me what I should/shouldn't do. My partner is typically supportive. He empowers me and encourages me to parent. HCBM doesn't like that and I honestly get it but it's our home.,47

z9ajyp,stepparents,17,Personally.... at your age and under these circumstances I'd leave this situation,12
z9ajyp,stepparents,18,"It’s quite cute that at 28, you say you are young, but getting old. I assure you, 28 is still young, young! This is the time to live your life. If there’s a little dream in your heart to have the trendy condo in the big city (been there, done that, forever grateful I did), then do that! I moved to London, UK when I was 24, worked for a fashion photographer, dated foreign men, weekends in Paris, etc. Glad I did it, and it also made me more comfortable now with a slower pace of life, having that out of the system. I believe you have a desire for exploration of yourself for a reason. If you want to take emotions out of, statistically, majority of people end up married, and most with a family, so that dream is, in a sense, almost inevitable, unless it’s something you choose not to partake in. However, the dream of the big city is not something that will happen unless you actively seek it out. Much easier (and way more fun) to do in your late 20’s, then never have done it, and truly to re-live it later in life. Not to say it can’t happen, but it will likely be harder. Neither choice is “wrong” but think of which one might be easier to pivot from, should you wish to. Best wishes",231
z9ajyp,stepparents,19,"I always advise people to run. Even though my partner is the best partner I’ve ever had, the package deal blows.",21
z9ajyp,stepparents,20,If you want more perspective try reading the book StepMonster. It takes years for blended families to be fully integrated and there’s still problems in most. And the phrase “in a blended family someone always gets creamed” has been true for most I know (and it’s usually the stepmoms).,49
z9ajyp,stepparents,21,"People on this subreddit often ask if people would still chose step life knowing what they know now, and most seem to agree they wouldn’t. Or some say it’s only worth it because they have such a good partner, but it’s not a good life.",45
z9ajyp,stepparents,22,I would walk away.,4
z9ajyp,stepparents,23,You didn’t write anything that says you should stay.,9
z9ajyp,stepparents,24,"Plenty of other commenters have touched on you still have plenty of other options, are young, and deserve to live out your dreams.",23
z9ajyp,stepparents,25,"From a different, more practical standpoint: what’s the plan with your house? Are you expected to sell it? Is the expectation that you’d use that money on a down payment on a joint place? I 100% recommend against commingling long term investments in your future, like real estate, with someone you are not married to. This could become a real nightmare if you were to separate. You’re a homeowner at 28, have given yourself a big financial advantage, and I’m not really seeing how leaving that puts you ahead any.",90
z9ajyp,stepparents,26,"Leave. I was divorced, had a lovely home, good job, and while I wanted to leave the area I was in I had a stress free life. I moved and bought a home with SO 11 months ago and it's been a pretty unhappy experience. I love my house but IMO the loss of peace isn't worth it. I'm considering getting out",62
z9ajyp,stepparents,27,Sounds like you are already considering the move as having more Pros than Cons listed. I would really recommend evaluating your reasons and not move for him or SK. Resentment can build fast under normal conditions. Setting boundaries will be essential for your peace of mind. This is a rocky road you are considering and if it were me I would probably opt to not do it.,67

The next house he would be financing with a VA loan. I would not be financially responsible. We'd split bills.",66
z9ajyp,stepparents,36,You have your whole life ahead of you. If you're thinking you can do better - you can. At your age there are still plenty of other child free people on the market who you can start fresh with...without the baggage of SKs or a BM. And be able to enjoy some child free years before starting your own family. (If that's what you want),65
z9ajyp,stepparents,37,"I married my DH(51) at 41 and I wouldn't trade him for the world. His youngest is 14 so just a few short years of being free from BM, child support, etc. No way I could have coped with this with young kids where theres no light at the end of the tunnel. When I was your age I would have never dated someone with kids. Really, it's all those child free years I lived before my DH doing whatever I wanted that keeps me sane in my current situation dealing with SKs and BM....just knowing that having minor SKs is almost over.",103

I have absolutely zero energy after school. I don’t go to the gym anymore, I don’t have energy to cook so dinner is usually microwaved or cereal. Tonight I burst into tears when I realized I haven’t played with my cat for a few days. My home is neglected. Clothes are on the floor because I’m too exhausted to fold them and put them away. I have grad school classes two nights a week and then the rest of the week I get home, and essentially just wait until I think it’s acceptable to go to bed. I feel like I am putting 100% of myself into school and I have nothing left. I sleep for 8-9 hours every night. I know my diet affects my energy levels, but I can’t seem to find the energy (or the funds $) to buy and make myself healthy meals. I’ve never cried from exhaustion before now.

I became so mentally exhausted in my first year that I became physically ill and ended up having a short hospital stay. A lot of the comments here suggest not working beyond contracted hours. I don't find this feasible; the days are less stressful when you are prepared. Instead of this, I would suggest setting an end time for your day. My day ends at 3:12 and I allow myself to work until 4:30 and then I go home. Being your first year, you are likely going to need more time. Other things to keep in mind are:",112

z9cvc1,teaching,23,It's okay to give yourself some quiet time. Your students can do silent reading for 15 minutes and you can take a breather if you need it.,27
z9cvc1,teaching,24,Don't reinvent the wheel. Reach out to other teachers in your school or district and ask if they have resources or lesson plans that they are willing to share. Sure a lesson might not be perfect but if you're already overwhelmed it's better than burning out. The kids will not suffer because you don't have a perfect lesson plan every time.,61

z9cvc1,teaching,26,"First off, remember that **there is no obligation to stay in this field**. This field is under-valued and over-worked. You're always, always, always within your rights to say ""fuck this"" and go home. Being a teacher isn't a ""calling,"" it isn't a path to ""saving the world.""

z9cvc1,teaching,27,"**If you stay in teaching, some of these problems will alleviate over time.** Eventually, you'll finish your grad degree. If you stay in the same content area for a while (which I advise) you'll expand your bank of activities and teaching resources, which will streamline your planning time considerably. If you stay in the same building, you'll develop a sense for which tasks are avoidable bullshit, which tasks are unavoidable bullshit, and which tasks are actually worth investing time in.",80
z9cvc1,teaching,28,"**Remember, they need you more than you need them.** Admin, students, parents, and society at large WILL try to make you feel like your efforts and accomplishments as a teacher are insufficient. Ignore them. These people literally have no idea what they're talking about and they would collapse if placed in your shoes. Sometimes, other teachers will try to tear you down. Ignore them, too. They're just bitter fucks trying to assuage their own anxiety. **The fact that you are here at all means you've gone above and beyond**. There's absolutely no obligation to be an award-winning teacher, a ""transformative educator,"" or any of that other highfalutin bullshit. If you just do your job consistently at a minimal level, you're contributing more to society than most other members of the workforce. Even if all you do is sit there and make sure none of the kids die, you're fulfilling an essential and undervalued social function.",155
z9cvc1,teaching,29,"**In the mean time, take care of yourself**. Schedule as many sick days and personal days as you can afford. (I say afford, NOT justify.

Reach out to your friends and family to let them know you need extra support right now.",65
z9cvc1,teaching,30,"**Some practical tips for your well-being:** Buy a slowcooker. Fill it 1x every day or two with enough beans, rice, and frozen veggies to make as many meals as you'll need. It'll get a bit repetitive but it's easy to clean, nutritious, and having a hot filling meal every day will comfort you in a way that microwave meals will not.

z9cvc1,teaching,35,"One suggestion that has really saved me, is that if you know any teachers in the district that teach the same thing as you, don’t be ashamed to ask for all of the stuff they have and their planning methods.

Not more than once a month. And not the months with many days off. You don’t want to be spoken to for attendance.

z9cvc1,teaching,47,"I think teaching is different, now. The workload is astronomical, and the schools operate like cults that demand every minute of your time, including unpaid time. While grad school is difficult to do while you're teaching (I did this early on in my career.), something strange and concerning is happening in education. The role I once held has become so untenable, I resigned from my district recently due to multiple instances of toxic work environment. It seems my role now includes being bullied, and Idk if it is falling down the stairs at work, being evaluated by admin with no teaching experience, getting covid and subsequent struggles with cognition, fatigue, mood regulation, and joint pain, lock down drills, being falsely accused of abuse, being underpaid commensurate with my experience by administration, but it hardly seems worth all this effort, anymore. I am searching for the next thing, as this teaching business doesn't seem like something I want to participate in, anymore...it seems like post-pandemic, the expectations are outrageous on the part of school officials. I don't care for this trend of hiring bullies and retaining bullies into high positions, either.

z9cvc1,teaching,54,"Almost no one ever becomes a ""good"" teacher. What is asked of us, especially in this country, is essentially impossible to do well. So be realistic and accept that you are just learning to become the best teacher you can be. Don't try to be perfect and certainly don't worry too much about what the staff and faculty think of you as a ""teacher"". If you do this, you will work yourself into the ground (likely with little to no reward). Stick to your core values as a person and as a teacher. Be faithful to these and you will naturally gain the right skills for YOU to build the type of classroom culture YOU dream of! Over time, probably after several years, you will see things come together.",129
z9cvc1,teaching,55,"As a first year, you will probably fuck up a lot. Observe your coworkers when you can (even if it's just hearing them out at staff meetings or checking out how/what they've decorated their classrooms with).

z9cvc1,teaching,61,Your first year is impossible. It is hell. I can’t imagine what it would be like with grad school on top of it.

With that being said, your struggle is real. It’s not easy. As a teacher, you are mentally engaged for 8 hours a day. Most workers have maybe 4 hours of real mental engagement. Sleeping 8-9 hours a night is a blessing though. From a compensation and inflation perspective, I suspect many of us are not eating well. Treat yourself to something nice, don’t be hard on yourself. You are winning, even though it’s hard!",105

You will always have a huge backlog of things which need to get done, and that's okay. And if you're a perfectionist, you're gonna need to get over that, too. Part of that is learning to selectively tune out the nonstop drumbeat from grad school, admin, PDs, etc. that every single thing we do is ultra-important and every single lesson needs to be a Danielson masterpiece (or substitute in whatever rubric your district uses).",104

z9cvc1,teaching,78,"First off, I’m so sorry; honestly, just like everyone has said, the first year is so hard. I definitely remember feeling everything you’re saying (especially in the time between thanksgiving and Christmas). There were a few things that really helped me my first year (and continue to help me when I have really rough weeks). First, I’ve always been a runner, and I really stopped running the first couple months of my first year. I started making myself go run for 15 minutes (I live in the city and made my run part of my commute). Almost immediately, I felt like I got a little of myself back; it’s kind of wild what 15 minutes of fresh air and exercise can do. I also got really into meal prepping on the weekends; I tried to incentivize it (watching shows/movies I was looking forward to), and it turned into something I really look forward to even years later. The last thing that I think practically made a big difference was scheduling things during the week that I knew I wanted to do and then sticking with them. It can feel SO hard and isolating, but having something on a Tuesday evening that meant I literally couldn’t stay at work until 6 made a huge difference for me. Hope some of that helps! Mostly, you’re doing great, you can do this, AND you don’t have to do this. Give yourself grace and know that if you want to keep doing this, it will get better!",253

z9cvc1,teaching,82,"Something that has helped me is to find things that help me mentally reset on the weekend. If I can feel like I used my weekend to do something I enjoyed, was restful, or fun, or worthwhile but most importantly for myself I can make it through Wednesday on that feeling. After that I hang in there until the weekend again. Also this is just me but relaxing games that I can spend hours in without thinking about anything else such as Stardew Valley or Pokemon really help with the burnout when I get home.

Use your time efficiently while at work and most importantly, let go of having everything be perfect. If it doesn’t get done, then it doesn’t get done. Oh well. Also for food I find that buying pre prepared/seasoned meats and pre chopped vegetables makes cooking easy. Just stick it in the air fryer. As for working out, aim for only 2 days a week. As long as you are moving a lot at work (which I know we are a lot as teachers), and eating within your calorie range for the day, you will be more than fine. I know exactly how you feel.

unknown,unknown,6,I got some ideas/hypotheses that I think apply to two root factors of your problem,15
unknown,unknown,7,**Conclusions**,1
unknown,unknown,8,"One conclusion strongly guides thinking, planning and decisions. For example, if one concludes ""I hate broccoli"", he/she will reject broccoli and any food make with it. It the hated thing is a person, he/she will not want to interact with or maybe even stay near the person.",47
unknown,unknown,9,"So, when you conclude ""I am exhausted"", this has an effect in your thinking, planning and decisions. The point is: is it fully true? Consider a scenario that you're feeling extremely exhausted and your house catches fire; you will certainly have energy to do something.",45
unknown,unknown,10,"The simplest way I know to question such conclusions is to make a question out of it: ""Do I hate broccoli?"", ""Am I exhausted?"" Some emphasis may help: ""Am I *really, completely* exhausted??"". This opens the conclusion and makes it easier or less difficult to do something.",47
unknown,unknown,11,**Connections**,1
unknown,unknown,12,"The best days I use to have at work is when I *complete* tasks. When something remains pendent and I ""take it home"", that's when I get more tired. The days with several pendencies are the worst.",37
unknown,unknown,13,"We have *connections* to things, persons, problems, tasks. A connection is associated with some *feeling*. When we complete something, we can disconnect from it; we don't feel it anymore. To ""take a task home"" means that we keep the connection with the task active. In the ideal scenario, we keep a connection active only when we dedicate to it; an active connection with something else is a distraction, an interference.",70
unknown,unknown,14,"I think that you are ""taking the problems home""; technically, you keep active whatever you felt something about. In other words, and as you have undesirable feelings about your experiences, you keep feeding the connections and this becomes a cycle.",40
unknown,unknown,15,"So, what to do? To fight such connections is a lost battle, they are reinforced by the attention they receive. Tire the body works for me, but sometimes a get into a state similar to yours and have to find another option. The simplest and best solution to me is to connect to another thing, for example some activity that you love do do. In fact, anything that deviates your attention from the problem will work; so, simply *start the search for a solution* is a step in the right direction.",91

unknown,unknown,20,"This is a job where you could work 24hrs a day year-round and you'll still never be fully ""done"". Make your work/life boundaries FIRM or you'll get all Sissyphus-y and noone fucks with that behavior.",35
unknown,unknown,21,That first year of teaching AND grad work is beyond exhausting. The bit about not going to the gym was esp. relatable. By the end of that first year I looked like a skeleton.,34
unknown,unknown,22,"Remember the minimum passing grade for your classes and work to be a svelt but safe margin above that. You are learning so much, and practicing so many skills, that it is almost impossible for you to be a """"""""""good teacher"""""""""" and meet ALL the expectations put on you.",49
unknown,unknown,23,"If you stick with it and survive the year, all this will be a laughable memory when you get to your second year.

It makes a world of difference, and I'm stoked for you to experience it.",59

unknown,unknown,26,I was going to say the same thing; it's a mental health day to safeguard your mind. I take them as needed using my days.,25
unknown,unknown,27,"I am not sure that working to contract is the best advice in a teachers first year. In general, it takes a while to hit the learning curve and sometimes overwork is just part of the deal early on. Having said that, you need to take care of yourself. Stress and the accompanying depression/anxiety that comes with it cannot be slept off like a flu. You just have to move. Walk around the block a few times. But don’t just give in to gravity. Gravity is not your friend. Even moderate exercise is better than any medication. And I oughta know.",101
unknown,unknown,28,On the subject of mental health days: it sometimes helps to get signed off for intermittent FMLA. You will wanna reach out to your Primary Care Provider or a therapist to help with this documentation. It ensures that you are protected from administrative action for the absences.,47

Anyway, I hope to be in your shoes next year. Are you glad you chose this path, exhaustion notwithstanding? Are your fellow teachers supportive?

unknown,unknown,50,"Thank you for this. I decided I’m taking a personal day next week. It’s confusing because I do not take work home, even though it sounds like I do. I leave at contract time every day. I think I am mentally taking stuff home and that’s the thing I don’t know how to stop",54
unknown,unknown,51,"I totally get what you’re saying. And I’ve thought about it a lot. But what makes a first year teacher different from any other teacher? How many first year teachers suffer so badly that they quit? If teacher programs aren’t preparing teachers to teach, something has to change. It shouldn’t just have to be, welp everyone had a really shitty first year, good luck and do your best. What would it look like if first year teachers worked to contract like anyone else? My teacher mentor when I was in grad school, stayed after school until at least 6pm every day. I had a principal who said teachers should stay until the work is finished. This mentality needs to change. My argument is that teachers would learn time management even sooner and they letting go of things is ok if they left on time.",144
unknown,unknown,52,Yea or if you want a livable wage,8
unknown,unknown,53,It is not a TFA requirement. Perhaps some states require it.,11
unknown,unknown,54,"For those who downvoted me, I can’t leave a your/ you’re mistake because I just claimed to be a teacher. That’s a baaaad mistake to make for a teacher, In my honest opinion. Right up there with not knowing how to use they’re, their, and there; or to, too, and two. I figure if I’m responsible for educating the next generation, I’d better hold myself to the appropriate standard I’d hold them to.",73
unknown,unknown,55,"I am thankful every day. I have only known food service and hospitality for my adult life. I used to sit there at various restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, etc staring out the window for hours on slow days miserable out of my mind, dreaming of being anywhere else. I would do it all again. I have gotten better at many things, and other things are a work in progress. My biggest advice is be a fair, kind, funny hardass as soon as you can in the year. Drink water. Eat well. Don't take things personally. Know that you will lose sleep, lose weight, and feel overwhelmed, and be prepared for that. My administration and colleagues are supportive enough and my coach is AMAZING but doesn't know my content area. Lesson planning and grading are huge learning curves but admin will look more at classroom management in my experience. Drink whatever Kool aid your school is pushing, for us it's PBIS and relevancy statements, but be realistic about your abilities. And above all remember that you have to teach the kids you have. No amount of complaining will transform your students into what you expect of them. They are who they are. You can't teach students who aren't there--so don't try. Best of luck to you <3",216
unknown,unknown,56,Just because you aren't at work or doing work tasks doesn't mean that your body is at rest.,18
unknown,unknown,57,"Make a list of things that make you feel truly rejuvenated and require little energy and try to do at least one or two of those things each night. Then, on your days off, seriously dive into those fulfilling passions. It can be easy to fall into a spiral of low-input dopamine seeking tasks (like reddit lmao) but those rarely allow our minds rest and rejuvenation.",66
unknown,unknown,58,"Another thing that took time for me to master: Feel justified in saying no to as many invitations/obligations as you need to in order to thrive mentally/emotionally. This is a marathon, not a sprint.",34
unknown,unknown,59,"Meditation and yoga helped tremendously. I never was too rigorous, but it focused me to be present in the moment, which helped me recognize the work stuff I was bringing home.",31
unknown,unknown,60,"I did a post on another sub about “educational martyrs“. Many teachers had something to say about this. I got close to 1000 comments, most like me, had very little patience for the type of teacher who puts in 12 hours a day without any compensation. The pay they get is the right to humble brag. It’s not just that they work hard and long hours. It’s they work harder and longer than YOU do. And of course, they have to let you know or else all that work they did was in vain. Because I don’t believe for a minute that they are doing it for all “the kids“. We’re all fucking doing it for the kids! These people undermined their peers at contract negotiations. The administration puts them on a pedestal wrap some shiny wrapping paper and put some ribbon on therefore head. See! If these people can work all these extra hours without pay that you should be able to do it too. Aren’t you in it for the kids?",173
unknown,unknown,61,"Having said all that, we need to be supportive of this particular teacher who is reaching out for help. Now. She can’t wait for this flawed model of teacher preparation to be rearranged.",33

I'm fine tuning my style as a sub, though I know the dynamic of having my own classes will be very different! I was in sales for years, and I can relate to what you said about longing to anywhere else! I left sales a few years ago with 0 regret.

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,0,AITA for uninviting my newly homophobic friend from my wedding?,10
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,1,"I (25f) am getting married to my fiance next month. The wedding planning has been a smooth process and we've had no issues until late last week. I invited a friend (N) from school, we've been friends for 12 years and have drifted apart due to life. She has always been quiet and not one to open up much, but Ive witnessed her unwavering support for the lgbtq+ community numerous times. N got into a relationship about 4 years ago and had a baby with the man (L) last year. I met L at her baby shower and he seemed decent until I noticed some things, such as complaining that his son will not be using a pink colored teething ring and that the gender neutral clothing looked too 'girly', and that he answered quite a few questions for N, stared her down and would white knuckle her knee every time she tried to give a different answer. I wholeheartedly believe she is being abused, because she is so quiet and doesnt stand up for herself.",176
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,2,"The main issue is that my gay sister and a few of my gay/bisexual cousins and friends are in my wedding party, and L does not like that. They (mostly L) called me last week to let me know how disrespectful it was to god that Ive allowed ""the homos to infiltrate a sacred god ordained union"". I laughed and hung up. N called me some hours later when she was alone and apologized for L's behavior, but told me she cant do anything about that. I asked her if she truly felt the way about my wedding that L claimed she did, and she sat quiet for about a minute before she laughed a bit and let an I dont know slip out of her mouth. I let her know that because of recent events regarding the lgbtq community here in Colorado I will be protecting my family and friends by not taking any chances, and therefore she and L are uninvited from my wedding. If anyone is wondering how they found out about my family being lgbtq+, me and fiance started a large group chat of friends/family to get to know eachother, and a few relatives have shocked me by their vitriolic contempt for the lgbt community, so they have been uninvited as well for safety, and fiance agrees.",221
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,3,"A few mutual friends are calling me an asshole and unreasonable for what Ive done, because we've all seen N's support for the community firsthand, and we've all seen the manipulative behavior from L and know she is possibly being abused. Unfortunately I dont feel I can do anything further and Im going to do what I feel is right to protect my family. So, AITA?",66
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,4,"Edit: Whether or not N supports the lgbtq community or not (I strongly believe she still does and is too scared to admit it) she is still my friend and she is being abused. There is a lot of victim blaming going on in the comments and Im not going for it. Please quit blaming her for 'choosing' an abusive man, when we all know how hard it is to leave a situation like this, especially after a child is born into the relationship.",84

I wanted to mention (probably already occurred to you) but she may not have actually been alone on the phone, he may have been listening in or from the other room or something, so that's why she said ""I don't know.""

It’s your wedding at the end of the day. Of course you’d choose family over this guy.",77

Protect them and when you get the chance. Kick that sorry sack of false Christian shit in the nuts. As a Christian (I know right two in one crazy) I find it horrible he claims god gives a dam. Quite frankly people are murdering and raping each other and destroying the planet. I don't think god gives a fuck who you have sex with. Or if you don't have sex. Not the point. I just don't believe god cares that much. If he is truly loves us all. He won't care who we love or who we are. So again thank you and kick L in the nuts.,132
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,27,"NTA - but if you care about your friend at all, I would strongly suggest that you make it very clear to her that uninviting her from the wedding does not mean that you want to break the friendship with her, and that if she ever needs help your door will always remain a crack open.",56
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,28,"If you are right, and if she is in a DV relationship, then isolating her from her friends, family and basically support system is a big portion of abusers strategy; and sadly often the support system helps with that by cutting them both out for the abusers shitty behavior - and that then over time creates an even bigger hurdle for the victim to get over, if she decides to leave but thinks that then she will be all on her own.",82

As N is no longer strongly against being associated with homophobia I am choosing to protect my family from being exposed to homophobic rants. People are murdering LGBTQ people, I am not the AH for wanting my wedding to be a safe space for my family during such a dark time for gay rights. I hope the N we all remember who would never tolerate homophobia resurfaces one day. Do you honestly see that happening before my wedding date?

I invited a friend (N) from school, we've been friends for 12 years and have drifted apart due to life. She has always been quiet and not one to open up much, but Ive witnessed her unwavering support for the lgbtq+ community numerous times. N got into a relationship about 4 years ago and had a baby with the man (L) last year. I met L at her baby shower and he seemed decent until I noticed some things, such as complaining that his son will not be using a pink colored teething ring and that the gender neutral clothing looked too 'girly', and that he answered quite a few questions for N, stared her down and would white knuckle her knee every time she tried to give a different answer. I wholeheartedly believe she is being abused, because she is so quiet and doesnt stand up for herself.",176
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,76,"The main issue is that my gay sister and a few of my gay/bisexual cousins and friends are in my wedding party, and L does not like that. They (mostly L) called me last week to let me know how disrespectful it was to god that Ive allowed ""the homos to infiltrate a sacred god ordained union"". I laughed and hung up. N called me some hours later when she was alone and apologized for L's behavior, but told me she cant do anything about that. I asked her if she truly felt the way about my wedding that L claimed she did, and she sat quiet for about a minute before she laughed a bit and let an I dont know slip out of her mouth. I let her know that because of recent events regarding the lgbtq community here in Colorado I will be protecting my family and friends by not taking any chances, and therefore she and L are uninvited from my wedding. If anyone is wondering how they found out about my family being lgbtq+, me and fiance started a large group chat of friends/family to get to know eachother, and a few relatives have shocked me by their vitriolic contempt for the lgbt community, so they have been uninvited as well for safety, and fiance agrees.",221
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,77,"A few mutual friends are calling me an asshole and unreasonable for what Ive done, because we've all seen N's support for the community firsthand, and we've all seen the manipulative behavior from L and know she is possibly being abused. Unfortunately I dont feel I can do anything further and Im going to do what I feel is right to protect my family. So, AITA?",66

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,79,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,80,NTA.,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,81,Edited because I initially missed that their invites were revoked.,10
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,82,Definitely NTA.,2
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,83,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,84,"thank you for standing up for our safety. it’s a horrifying time for queer and trans people right now, especially in the US",23
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,85,"NTA. I would be concerned for your friend too, but letting them come to the wedding is not going to improve her situation at all and puts everyone else there at risk of verbal (or worse) abuse. I think you did the right thing. I've got no patience in my life for racist or sexist or homophobic people, there are too many great people out there to waste time on them!",71
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,86,NTA you have to protect your family and guests.,9
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,87,"NTA. She may be supportive alone, but she isn't going to come to the wedding alone.",16
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,88,I hope you and your friends are able to help her out of the situation when she's ready,18
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,89,NTA you did good. Maybe after the wedding check in to see if she's ok?,15
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,90,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,91,"she made her choice, thus is the consequence!",8
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,92,Bigots are not welcome.,4
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,93,"NTA. It’s unfortunate that she may be in an abusive relationship. However, you can support her and still maintain boundaries that you will not tolerate homophobia. Her spouse is not welcome at the event. If she cannot or will not come alone, then unfortunately, she will have to sit this one out. Offer her your friendship and assistance but with the caveat that you will not endure or ask others to endure her husband’s bigotry.",75
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,94,NTA. Didn’t even have to read it to know that. Hanging out with homophobes and racists means you would be complicit in their views. Keep them both far away,29
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,95,"NTA. Doesn't matter if she supported them in the past, if she can't answer a direct question about how she feels about your wedding then she deserves to be disinvited. Of course L should not go, and probably should not be invited to future events either.",46
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,96,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,97,"Def don’t want L at wedding, N maybe if she comes alone",12
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,98,"You are allowed to cut out toxic people from your wedding. N is welcome, L is not, and N keeps choosing to stay with L, so what can you do? NTA.",31
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,99,"NTA. You standing up for the LGBTQIA+ community is heartwarming and commendable. The people that would ever say malicious, hurtful things against them are definitely people that you would want to stay clear from. And if that includes your friend and her partner, then, so be it. Your safety, as well as the safety of your friends and family, is what comes first.",63
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,100,NTA. You should Uninvite your friends who are complaining that you’re not inviting bigots to your wedding.,17
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,101,NTA. I would do exactly the same and uninvite anyone who poses a threat to both the wedding and the community.,21
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,102,">A few mutual friends are calling me an asshole and unreasonable for what Ive done, because we've all seen N's support for the community firsthand, and we've all seen the manipulative behavior from L and know she is possibly being abused.",41
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,103,"As sad as that is...so what? Even if she is being abused, I don't think your wedding day is the best time to try and sort her marriage situation. Like, how would you proceed? You can help her all you want (if she needs it) after. No need to bring the drama on your wedding day. The fact that not even during that private phone call without him present, she wasn't even able to reply with a clear ""NO, IM NOT HOMOPHOBIC"" says a lot. Protect yourself first.",88
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,104,NTA. Weddings are about love and inclusivity. Homophobia is antithetical to both. Thank you for doing all you can to keep your people safe.,24
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,105,"NTA, even without recent happenings, it’s important to protect your loved ones.",12
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,106,"Also, are N and L married? If not, L has no right to spout his pseudo-biblical sermon at you when he has a child out of wedlock. Not that I’d bring that up to someone that seems so clearly abusive (at least until you can help N get out), but still. Those in glass houses and all.",57
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,107,NTA I'm sorry you can say you support people all you want. you can go on all the marches you want. but when you marry a bigot and perpetuate b******* that's your own problem. you are obviously not who everyone thought you were I'm sorry she's being abused or neglected or controlled by an idiot man. she chose that . she does not have to continue to choose that. she could decide to be a decent human being.,78
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,108,"Oof. This is one hell of a catch-22. Disinviting your friend runs the risk of further entrenching the isolation her potentially abusive husband may be trying to force on her. Allowing them both to come clearly guarantees him making a scene and verbally/emotionally mistreating any LGBTQ+ loved ones in attendance and may feel like cosigning his beliefs. There are no good choices here, only harm reduction choices.",67
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,109,"Realistically, weddings and similarly high stakes emotional events are not good places to do the work of trying to preserve a friendship being broken down by an abusive partner. No one is going to have the emotional bandwidth to handle a crisis or problem well and since it's high stakes that's likely to end in hurt feelings all around. This feels like a good time to reach out to your friend and kindly offer a method of regular communication at least somewhat protected from her husband's interference before letting her know that you cannot allow her husband to attend your wedding, and while you are not explicitly univiting her, she is welcome to say or do whatever she needs to in order to keep herself safe, and you will not hold those decisions against her. Tell her you love her and want only her happiness, and that you hope she stays in touch, and then make sure someone is on hand to turn him away if necessary.",167
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,110,"I'm really sorry this is happening. There are difficult choices coming down the road for you, but I hope your wedding is lovely and peaceful.",25
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,111,NTA Op this is your wedding to have with family. She is not a good friend at all and should not be a friend. She will only add bigotry to your life instead of adding anything positive. This is the time when you let her go. She is homophobic so she can lie in the bed she made by daring to throw her gods opinion at you about your life. You don’t need her negativity as you are doing everything right by protecting your family from homophobic people.,88
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,112,The nerve of L! I’m so sad for your friend. Hopefully this disinvite will be a slight wake up.,19
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,113,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,114,"NTA and I’m cackling, “infiltrate” makes me think of super spies with ear pieces and dark glasses. If you wanted to be REALLY antagonistic, they could all dress up in dark clothes with sunglasses and make a caption about infiltrating the wedding. 😂 I am sorry about your friend, though. Assuming she’s always been an ally, it stands to reason that she might feel pressured to be this way because of him. Maybe he didn’t always act like this. Who knows? It’s best to keep your people safe, though. There’s not much you can do besides that at the moment.",100
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,115,"NTA. You mentioned that she is potentially being abused by her partner . It is possible that she does not agreed with her partner ‘s views and defends him or not say anything out of fear . You have every right to tell them not to come , I would be worry too if that guy is at the wedding due to recent terrible event that happened in Colorado. And your mutual “friends” for their lack of understanding and insensitivity and of course her partner are the assholes in this . On that note , I hope your friend can safely get out that toxic ( potentially abusive ) relationship soon as possible . I wouldn’t be surprised if her partner’s awful views on LGBTQ+ community plus his manipulative behavior is the reason she may feel that she can’t voice her true opinions and agreed with him out of fear and retaliation.",152
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,116,Very much NTA,3
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,117,"Yes, she is likely being abused. And you know what a lot of mass shooters have in common? A history of domestic violence. It’s terrible that the world has come to this, but it’s completely reasonable for you to be afraid for your friends’ safety in this situation.",48
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,118,"I would make it clear to her why you’re doing this, and while you’re at it let her know to contact you if she needs help getting out.",28
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,119,"NTA, as a lesbian with family that tolerates gay people at best, I can’t imagine how validating it is for your sister and other queer family members to know that you support them and the lgbtq+ community enough to uninvited someone you’ve been friends with for 12 years. I know for a fact my family wouldn’t uninvite someone from their wedding for being homophobic, even if they weren’t close to them. you’re doing the right thing, and I guarantee this means a lot to your family. imo, this is what being an ally looks like - making hard decisions that benefit and support the queer community even when they may cause controversy and contempt.",114
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,120,"I truly hope your friend can get out of this damaging relationship, but until she does it’s simply not safe for your family to be around her or her partner.",30
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,121,edit: typo,2
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,122,NTA protect your family and friends. No hateful bigots needed at your beautiful wedding!,14
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,123,I also hope you can be there for N if and when she ever manages to get away from that abusive bigot.,22
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,124,NTA - you're right in protecting your friends and family.,10
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,125,"NTA. Aside from all the other comments about protecting your friends in this climate (which are completely valid), there's also the rock-hard axiom -- your wedding, your choice.",28
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,126,Yes she is definitely being abused,6
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,127,Yes you should do everything you can to get her away from her abuser,14
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,128,No you don’t need to invite her to your wedding to be able to do that,16
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,129,"NTA, I wouldn't let L near my family either. Homophobes need to stop using religion for being assholes. Love is love and they can stay at home.",27
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,130,"Yes, N is being abused, but until she does something it won't change. She will never get help, just support, until she leaves.",23
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,131,"NTA. Always protect your family first. I would have done the same thing as you. There’s no place for bigotry and hatred in polite society. However, if you can find a way to privately let your friend know that there are resources out there to help her out of an abusive relationship, I would do that as well. It sounds like she’s being coached into saying what her partner wants to hear and I worry for her safety. But your instinct to protect your family is spot on, so don’t budge on that front.",94
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,132,Unless they are using the wedding to get her out of the situation like they’re Oskar Schindler there is nothing wrong with disinviting her.,24
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,133,You probably should take some very serious steps to address your friends safety though.,14
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,134,"NTA, but your distant friend needs someone close to her to offer help. You don't want to look back and think ""I always thought he might hurt her"".",28
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,135,She chose a life of homophobia and domestic abuse. I wouldn't invite her either. NTA,15
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,136,"While you are NTA for deciding not to invite your friend, I think the title of this post is rather misleading. the title paints N as being newly homophobic, but you admit it sounds more like she’s possibly being abused and suppressed by her husband. You might want to edit that if you can, because it comes across a bit that you’re judging her to be homophobic for not standing up to her husband, even though you suspect she’s being abused.",81
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,137,"again, NTA for keeping her out of the wedding to keep the peace, but see if you can reach out to her separate from the wedding to see if she’s alright.",31
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,138,"NTA. People change. She may have been supportive before, but clearly that has changed for her. She called to say sorry, but when you asked if she felt that way she said ""I dont know"". That means she feels the same as him and is apologizing to make you feel better, not because she is sorry.",56
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,139,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,140,"Date stupid men, win stupid prizes.",6
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,141,Some women are very malleable when they are in relationships. She’s made her choices and has to live with the consequence. Maybe it’ll be a wake-up call.,27
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,142,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,143,NTA. But the way she responded on the phone…I wonder if he monitors her calls / messages. Her reaction was not normal. This woman is clearly terrified.,27
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,144,NTA.,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,145,"Honestly, straight women like her should stay away from us. She's being passive with him, maybe because she being abused, maybe because she's just that much in love. Who cares though, because letting someone like her near lgbtq+ people and/or spaces, means she brings her own personal monster. I respect you for putting her in her place with it, and it actually makes me feel better seeing more examples of a straight people who truly get it too. Esp after the latest incident.",83
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,146,"Congrats on your wedding, I hope you have a lovely day.",11
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,147,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,148,NTA and thank you.,4
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,149,"Definitely NTA. Your friend doesn’t sound homophobic, I agree her us and us and she’s being abused. But it dies t sound like you’ll be able to invite her without him, and he is clearly not a safe person. I would encourage you and/or one of your other mutual friends to offer your support to her privately if you can, but I would absolutely not have that man in your life or at your wedding.",75
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,150,op=NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,151,"I'm sorry for your Friend N and if you can let her know you will try to maintain a friendship if she needs it, that you cannot allow your family (and other friends) be abused and possibly endangered by L.",40
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,152,"Unfortunately, she is making a choice by being with L and that means she loses out on some of the privileges of friendship because of his behavior.",27
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,153,"Even if she is being abused, it won’t help her to go to the wedding, she’ll just be tormented by his actions alienating her from her friends even more. NTA but see if she’s willing to take any help",39
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,154,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,155,"You are protecting your friends and family. And you can still support N by giving her numbers that will help her or setting up a help word she can use if she needs to leave ASAP, but you aren't responsible for her if she doesn't take anything",47
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,156,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,157,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,158,"Yes your friend is in an abusive relationship. However you do not need to invite the abusive and hateful commentary into your wedding. He’s already shown that he will not respect you, your wedding, or your guests so he has no reason to be at your wedding. Your wedding is also not the place to start a fight for her independence.",61
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,159,NTA. Have lots to say but will just get me more riled up. NTA,14
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,160,Definitely NTA for keeping friends and family safe! Abusers can manipulate and destroy people's sense of self so I do hope you can stay in touch and give her a safe space if she confronts the abuse and tries to recover,41
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,161,"Nope, NTA. I'm so sick of women giving sex to homophobes/racists/anti-Semites/misogynist. Is she that insecure she has to be with a dude like that? Nope, I wouldn't talk to her at all anymore, it doesn't matter what she ""used to do"" for the Community if she lets some guy erase it.",51
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,162,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,163,&#x200B;,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,164,"thank you for what you did, to protect your friends and family. thank you",14
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,165,Bravo.,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,166,"NTA, I’m a married lesbian and I would really appreciate someone who uninvited people who didn’t support my choices. It’s never ok and if they don’t like it they need to get used to not being welcome places.",38
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,167,Lmfao man these people are truly miserable in life!,9
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,168,Don’t invite her! Enjoy your day with your TRUE FRIENDS!,10
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,169,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,170,NTA. You’re doing your part in protecting those you love.,10
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,171,"NTA, and family comes first. It may end your friendship with the dis-invited, but that's the better choice.",18
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,172,"NTA - it's your wedding first and foremost, however no matter what anyone's beliefs are (religioin or not) basic human decency should factor into it. The fact that you Have to protect your LBTQ+ etc friends and family, from family just makes them the AH's IMHO. Everyone is a person at the ened of the day, no matter their sex, beliefs, skin colour etc, but it's a wedding, they are there to celebrate you getting married, can't they put their personal bullshit aside for ONE day?",86
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,173,"NTA. Even if she's only acting this way out of a need to placate her husband, that isn't any better. Being complacent is being complicit. She should be actively trying to change his mind if she really wants to be supportive. I think she just likes being an ally in label alone.",52
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,174,"NTA, N and other people have to realize that you don't support a community if you chose a partner that attack said community, in this world some things are grey, but others are clearly black and white",37
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,175,NTA!,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,176,"I think YTA. You seen your friend being abused and didnt do anything about it and you saw her support the lgbt community, so you know she does. If he is manipulating her into being homophobic then youre TA again for not just inviting her and giving her a chance to explain herself without him breathing down her neck.",59
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,177,"Also if L and your relatives didnt threaten your family and just dont agree with the gay lifestyle, they should be given some grace. Lots of peopl dont agree with being gay but they shouldnt be punished for it by not celebrating your love with you.",46
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,178,"YTA. Said my opinion, if you downvote me that's your conscience not mine.",13
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,179,"YTA not for uninviting people from your wedding for homophobic views. YTA for not offering N the support she needs. You say you have been friends for 12 years but you cut her off from part of her support network, you may be all she has. Call her, get her help. Email her info on battered womens shelters if you think physical abuse. Offer her a place to go if she wants out. Dont leave your friend in a position where all she has is an abuser .",88
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,180,"So, you truly believe that inviting someone who is anti-gay to your wedding would create a safety issue for others? Are you worried for their actual physical safety, which seems a bit far-fetched, or are you worried that this guy might say something to hurt someone's feelings? Depending on how much you value your friendship with N, you need to carefully evaluate whether you have a legitimate safety concern or are you just virtue signaling on behalf of your gay friends/family? Also consider how important it is (or isn't) to your friend to attend. You say you've drifted apart; maybe she really doesn't care about attending your wedding and viewed your invitation as a solicitation for a wedding present... (The whole thing about her narcissistic husband is a wholly separate issue. But, would you disinvite your friend if her husband were just a controlling narcissist without the anti-gay baggage? ) Just a couple of things to consider.",157
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,181,I came to say this!!!!! NTA. The climate is crazy right now and you can't chance an abuser doing something crazy.,21
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,182,"N may have done a ""lot"" in the past for the community, but she's absolutely showing that her support is conditional when it comes to her own personal comfort. And, guess what, that's absolutely not good enough, especially right now, to guarantee the well-being and safety of anyone LGBT at the wedding. If she's being abused, the safest course of action would not be centered around inviting N to the wedding and/or keeping her involved with the event, but for OP to say that she would support N if and when she needs help leaving.",95
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,183,"This. Help your friend get out of there if you can, but keep yourself and your loved ones safe. NTA",20
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,184,"All of this, but id also extend an olive branch to the friend to let her know op will help her if she needs to leave, that is textbook signs of abuse and the fact that he's so blatant about it in front of people means it is escalating",49
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,185,THIS! SO SO SO MUCH THIS!,6
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,186,"exactly, people expect us to continue to let ourselves be killed and maimed for their delicate heterosexual sensibilities pero I'm not taking any chances! It really sucks that your friend is being abused but it's up to the abused person to ask for help. right now she's just helping him be a homophobe and spread hateful rhetoric, enabling him by saying it's okay and continuing to not only date said homophobe but saying ""I don't know"" to whether or not she agrees with him. I would tell her ""I don't know"" if I can be friends with such a violent homophobe",101
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,187,This should be so much higher up.,7
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,188,"The OP can do both by telling N that you love her and you’re here if she needs you. But that you can’t have her, or anyone who can’t provide wholehearted support to the LGBTQ community at your wedding",39
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,189,"Yes! The absolute best thing OP can do right now is leave the door open to her if or when she needs it, but not to put the people at the wedding in danger.",34
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,190,A lot of people stay in abusive relationships because they feel isolated and trapped.,14
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,191,"Do what you need to do now to keep people safe, but also keep one foot in the door incase she also needs a safe place in the future.",29
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,192,Well said!,2
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,193,I believe OP used L for the male partner; her friend is N.,13
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,194,"Hopefully they can find someway to support N and talk with her about the abuse she is having done to her. Let her knowvwhat options she has if she needs to escape, who to call and where she can stay.",40
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,195,"Yes, N is showing signs she's coping with the abuse by identifying with her perpetrator. Tragic, but not OP's responsibility.",20
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,196,I came here to say exactly that! What is to gain by inviting her to the wedding? She most likely would be uneasy about her SO doing something stupid and not fully enjoy the wedding anyway.,36
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,197,How is it jot helping? Not having a person like L at the wedding is 100% the right thing. Also I guarantee that N will not be sloud to attend without L.,32
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,198,"This doesn't seem like rose colored glasses, N seems to be genuinely afraid of standing up for herself.",18
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,199,"The wedding is not the day to do it, I understand that, but OP may need to perform a legitimate rescue of N before things start to get physical. There isn't going to be that magical day where she wakes up and the truth hits her and she leaves on her own. Women in her position are in very real danger and need help getting to safety.",67
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,200,This.,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,201,"I would add that you could tell her specifically what support you could offer if she ever felt the need to leave her husband. Could you give her a ride to a shelter, offer her a room in your house, or help her get a bus ticket to a relative? Knowing what her options would be if she needed to leave can be the thing that helps her get free ultimately. Ideally she would make a safety plan for what to do if her situation became untenable.",87

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,203,"Even then, OP's absolutely NTA.",5
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,204,"This woman clearly sounds like she is in a Domestic Violence relationship, and leaving DV abusers is most often not easy at all - not the least due to the fact that often the abuse significantly escalated when the victim is leaving and the abuser fears that he is losing control; also btw the time when a majority of lethal incidences occur.",62
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,205,"Of course she should leave (safely), as soon as she can for many reasons; but quite frankly the guy being a homophobe probably *right now* is not exactly on the top of her immediate concerns (that might be more: “I hope he does not hurt me or kill me today”).",50
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,206,"And if anyone responds saying she's in an abusive relationship, point out it takes people in an abusive relationship 7 times to successfully leave. And they only leave when they want to. N doesn't want to leave yet and you don't know how long it's going to be until she does, or if she will ever want to leave. So your wedding isn't the time or place to force these difficult conversations & somewhere deep down, N knows that before L she would have made the same choice you're making now.",91
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,207,"She did not choose to be abused, and it can be extrememly difficult to leave abusive situations, especially when a child is involved. She may actually still support the community but she may be too terrified to let me know because she is being held under her boyfriends thumb. If she had told me she was still supportive, what if he was listening from the other room and decided to hurt her after she hung up? I want her to get help and get out but abusers are powerful and its not my place to meddle, though Im currently doing everything I can to set her up with a support system and resources.",113
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,208,"She is still my friend. Its not her fault that hes treating her this way and its difficult to leave abusive situations, especially when theres a child involved. She didnt choose that. She may not feel the way about the lgbtq community that her boyfriend does but unfortunately I cant take that risk.",53

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,218,"If OP only invites N and not L, then there is a chance that L won't let N go, or he'll tag along anyway and cause a scene. OP can't help N if she won't accept it.

I want her to get help and get out but abusers are powerful and its not my place to meddle in anyones relationship, though Im currently doing everything I can to set her up with a support system and resources as quickly as possible. I have not cut her off, I simply uninvited her from an event where my lgbtq family and friends will be vulnerable. I made a decision to protect my loved ones.",94
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,224,"1. Yes, I am without a doubt 100% concerned for their physical safety as well as their mental well being, so I am taking precautions. There are insane people everywhere, and literally anyone could snap at any moment! People in the community are being unalived solely for whom they choose to love or how they identify. Im developing a slight agoraphobia over the last few years simply because of this and its taking a lot out of me mentally to have over 100 people, all with different mental illnesses, backgrounds, and perspectives in the same room already. 2. The state of my friendship with N has nothing to do with my decision. If we hadnt talked in 10 years, or if we were as close knit as two people possibly could be, I would still be making the decision to keep my loved ones safe. I never stated that her boyfriend was a narcissist, I just know that what I witnessed was abusive behavior, those two things are not exclusive. 3. Ive asked guests not to bring gifts as me and my fiance have everything we need and want, because this is a celebration of love that we want to share with no obligations.",204
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,225,"Even if she is being abused, she called OP back when L wasn't around to apologize for his behavior. So when she laughed and said she didn't know if she agreed with what he said, she wasn't under any kind of threat which might have prevented her from speaking freely. (Presumably, if L had, say, cameras that also pick up audio, or bugged her phone, or something, she wouldn't have called OP to apologize for L in the first place, so she at least thought she could speak freely.)",89
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,226,"This is very important. He is trying to isolate her so she will have no escape route. Make it very clear that while she is not invited to the wedding, you will help her in find a safe place to stay if she ever decides to leave him.",48
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,227,Lgbt people aren’t the only ones getting killed. Women married to abusive spouses are also getting killed.,17
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,228,It’s also not easy for abused people to ask for help. Saying that the abused person is enabling a homophobe by not standing up to him is blaming the victim for not standing up to the abuser.,37
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,229,"It is very common for people to say “I don’t know” when they’re stuck in a situation like this. It usually happens when there’s an internal conflict between her belief of supporting lgbt people like she did in the past, and her current conditioning by the abuser to reject lgbt people.",51
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,230,"I’m not saying that OP should invite the friend and the husband, because Op definitely shouldn’t. But what I’m saying is that the friend has supported lgbt people in the past. Now that she’s in this situation, it’s more empathetic to help her out of an abusive relationship (separate from the wedding of course), instead of condemning her for not being able to go against her abuser",67
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,231,"I feel that is what is happening too. My aunt has been in an emotionally abusive relationship for the last 16 years. Over the years she began to repeat his points of view even when he is not around. It's been drilled into her head so many times I think she has come to believe that this is what she truely believes. OP could try and keep the invitation for N and only disinvite L, but N wouldn't show up without him. In this environment you can't allow the chance that L will show up with N, so they both will have to be cut from the guest list. If I was OP, I would still make sure that N knows that this is really about L and that OP will help her should she ever want to leave L. NTA.",141

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,233,"N probably is genuinely scared of him. But OP can’t save her unless she wants to be saved and that’s the sad reality of it. If she tries to make N leave now, it’s highly likely that N will end up going back to him anyway.",46
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,234,"‘Oh it’s not that bad’ ‘he didn’t mean to hurt me, he said he’s sorry’ ‘he only said it because of xyz’. Those are the glasses. You can see the red flags but with rose coloured glasses on, they just look like flags. OP could tell N until she’s blue in the face about all the bad things about L, but it doesn’t mean N is going to listen.",69
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,235,"People who have been in abusive relationships for a while end up going back to their abuser several times because it’s the devil they know. Sometimes they don’t get out until it gets really bad, sometimes they don’t get out before it’s too late. N has to want to leave, but I think it’ll be hard for her now, especially with their baby. I think if OP wants to be a good friend, she’ll always offer to be there for support and be ready to jump in and help when the day finally comes that N wants to leave. OP won’t be able to rescue her before that day.",109
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,236,"I’ve been in N’s situation. Twice. And it got worse and worse and worse and I didn’t leave no matter what. My second ex even threatened to stab me in the stomach with a knife while our son was laying in his Moses basket across the room. And I still didn’t leave him then. Because he had such a hold on me. He came back every time with apologies and flowers and loads of gifts and would get on his knees and beg for forgiveness, and I took him back every time because he made me believe that I was a horrible human being and that he was the only person who would ever want to be with me and I believed him. With everything he did to me, it took him kicking the crap out of me whilst holding our son for me to leave. I don’t know if you’ve ever been the situation, and I pray that you never have been, but it’s different for everyone and it’s easier to make comments looking in on the situation. I can make judgements about N and L’s relationship based off of what OP wrote, but I’ll never know their situation for sure.",202
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,237,That’s fair. I don’t think OP is wrong not to want the guy anywhere near them though. Hopefully they can get her out.,23
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,238,While being abused you start to change yourself for your partner you try to become more likable it’s practically brainwashing. She could have been confused and laughed as a nervous reaction,31
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,239,"as someone who has been abused and is both B and T I can't agree less. it is not the job of those around us to get us out of these situations and besides, it seems like OP has voiced concerns and the abuse isn't under the table. I'm sorry but abuse victim or not it is perpetuating homophobia. To the abuser she isn't going along with it because he's an abuser she's going along with it because she agrees and if she agrees then others agree and now not only are his actions of abuse okay but his homophobic ideology. I'm not going to pretend it's okay my best friend is saying I'm sinful and disgusting even if it's ""because"" of their abuser",124
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,240,"So, I currently live in a women's DV shelter. I am familiar with these kinds of situations, as I hear and see them everyday. Obviously I'm there myself after fleeing an abusive partner.",33
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,241,"I have sympathy, but the truth is, I *don't* understand these situations. It hurts my brain and my heart to listen to some of the things the other women say about going back to their old lives when they literally survived attempted murder.",43
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,242,"Several people, including my Stepmum, have made comments about me going back to my ex. I shut that shit down so fast. It makes me angry that anyone would think I could put myself through that again. Getting back in my own place and living my old life again is all I can think about.",55
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,243,"He threw me down the stairs after forcing me to live in garbage for months. He drank everyday and smoked weed like it was going to made illegal again. He constantly talked about what I needed to be doing for him, even though I gave up most of my possessions to move across the effing country to be with him.",60

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,245,"But she called OP to apologize for his behavior. If she's been so brainwashed by him, why do make the call in the first place?",25
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,246,You want to reach out when you’re in that situation just sometimes you can’t do it safely. Which is why she waited while he wasn’t around.,26
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,247,"Right. She called when she knew she could speak safely. So when asked if she agreed with the things he said, she was free to say 'no, I absolutely do not' – but she didn't say that.",37

z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,3,"Sitting down, across the table, I could feel the panic rising from the pit of my stomach. She was starting at me. That was never a good sign, those eyes could kill spiders with a glance. Thoughts flitting across my mind. Why does she have to do this? Every other 10 yr. old gets to go home and have cookies and milk waiting for them. They get to play video games and talk on the phone. They get tucked in at night with kisses and hugs.",86

z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,5,"“Sally, look at me in the face” she spit. Realizing that I had tuned her out, which was a mistake, the worries of how I was going to fix this start going through my head at lightning speed. My chest began to tighten as I slowly start to raise my head.",51
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,6,"“I thought I told you that the dishes and kitchen needed to be clean before you went to school today. You made me look so stupid when she came! HOW DARE YOU!” Then she cuffs me upside the head as spit flew from her mouth, spoiling the clean table.",49
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,7,"“She’s going to take you from here. You’re going to go live with strangers, you deserve that”, I shifted slowly to the edge of my seat so that when I fell it would look worse than it was. I knew where this was going. Nowhere good.",46
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,8,"“I said look at me when I’m talking to you.” Anger lit her voice up making it sound so venomous that I physically flinched. My brother peeked around the corner, concerned. In the backroom I could hear my sister playing with the hot wheels, probably making a horrid mess. Glancing at her would only make things worse. Shifting in my chair even closer to the edge, I replied with a meek voice,",72
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,9,"“Yes ma’am, I’m sorry.” WHAM. I fell off my chair with an audible thud to the hard floor. “Sorry? You will be sorry. They are going to do horrible things to you.

z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,10,"I could hear my sister calling for him in the back room. He hesitates, as this happens she whips her head toward the sound. She sees him.",27
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,11,"“Mom, I'm sorry I didn’t mean to forget, I’ll go do it right now” I quickly get to my feet. “Right now won’t fix it” she replied, once again her attention focusing like a snake about to strike. But I could see her calming down. I slowly move past her to go into the kitchen.",55
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,12,"“She is coming Friday. Make sure this house is clean,” Her voice normalizing, as I could slowly see the thoughts moving across her face, I could see her shifting back into mom. It’s like watching her become another person. This side of her made things livable.",46
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,13,"“Spaghetti sounds good for dinner. Do we have bread? Garlic bread and spaghetti, you always make the best spaghetti” her voice was becoming normal. She attempted a hug. Forcing myself not to flinch, I hug her back.",37

z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,16,"“Love you mom. I’ll come get you for dinner. Isn’t the news coming on soon?” As she walks into the living room to watch the news, I grab the pot and start filling it with water for the noodles. I feel my body start to relax. That crisis is avoided.",50

z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,40,Did they ever speak to the kids? They really should,10
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,41,Yes they did. We were brain washed. I was so scared I would be separated from my brother and sister. My bio had terrified me with tales of foster care. She was mostly mean to me. I knew handle that. I didn't know what would happen in foster care. This was before the internet being cheap and easy. ( Early 90s ) We didn't even get a phone until I was 16. We were brain washed. She would make us pack a bag and load into the car while telling us horrific things about foster care and stop at a random corner of a random rd drop us off and leave for hours. She would come back sometimes right away other times after hours and say things like even foster care doesn't want us. That we were so worthless that they(foster care ) didn't even want us. We didn't have any family. Just bio mom and the 3 of us.,160

z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,43,The neighbors shot his hunting dog so he got in an altercation with themwith a gun. Police showed up he was shot and killed by the police. I was 3-4 years old. ( he was a drunk and both bios did drugs off and on),45
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,44,Holy shit. So both parents were classy people then. I'm really glad you're out of there. Are your siblings out too?,21
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,45,Yes and no. Bio died in 2019. So we r free. However none of us have a relationship with each other. Trauma is a cycle. We have all hurt each other over the years bc we didn't know any better. Therapy for 8 years taught me that I can't just pretend it didn't happen so they don't like me bc I won't sugar coat what happened. Right now none of us talk to each other.

z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,3,"So I’m thinking about buying a truck and stocking it full of good tools. Things like lang, koken, lisle, nepros, wright, gray pneumatic, sunnex, mayhew, gear wrench, vim, ez red, etc. the point is to have good stuff and a great selection at fair prices.",45
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,4,"Now I believe I can be competitive, but probably won’t beat Amazon on everything. Is that a problem?",18
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,5,Have you ever been on an independent truck? Would you give one a try? Am I missing anything?,18
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,6,Thanks!,1
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,7,I’m sure you probably already know this but I’d reach out to the Mobile Tool network and see what it would take to get setup with them as a first step. I think an independent guy can make it as long as you’re good to your customers. Also take a look at what the Jersey Discount Tool guys carry those are the brands that would be worth selling too.,69
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,8,I had an independent for years. Get you anything you wanted. Super nice guy. Did business with him so long I didn’t have a truck credit limit with him.,29
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,9,I think you’re hurdle will be the lack of revolving credit line and warranty work. The truck functions as a line of credit for both the techs and the owner. Without the backing of the company your float will be difficult to manage. If you have experience managing multiple net 30/60/90 accounts with separate businesses then you have a leg up but it will be tricky.,66
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,10,"How are you planning on purchasing your stock? If a tool breaks, are you backing it? Will you swap it on the spot and send in the old one on your own credit?",33
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,11,If Amazon can have the thing in my hand by 4am the next day and you only come once a week that’s another hurdle.,24

z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,13,"I’m not saying it’s not possible, just saying there is a reason it’s not more prolific. I am also not supporting the snap on mode either. I almost bought a truck about 5 years ago but ultimately decided it wasn’t worth it. Snap on purposely keeps their trucks at about $100k a year net. If you exceed it then good for you, but your route will be divided up sooner or later. Owning multiple routes and hiring drivers/salesman to run the route at say 80% of net is really the only way it would be “worth it” in my book. The ability to order tools straight from snap ons website also didn’t sit well with me. The truck basically becomes a credit card (that you under sign) and a warranty spot. The only people that need the truck are the people that need to make payments.",146

z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,15,"I'm a little late to this convo but I own a small shop with a handful of guys.

Currently we only have a Snap On truck which I buy off of but the guy who is changing oil and rotating tires has no need for $300 impact sockets.",68
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,16,Look up techs choice/ koons Trucking on youtube,8
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,17,We have a independent guy. He’s geared more toward body shop work than automotive but he’s been around forever one of my coworkers has been buyin tools from him for like 20 years lol he also sells stuff for the same price as they are on Amazon (gear wrench and sunnex and whatnot) not sure how maybe he has commercial account and gets things cheaper. But he also doesn’t have a set territory like other tool trucks so he can go where ever he wants!,85
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,18,I don’t even know where to begin. This has been on my mind lately too.,15
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,19,"Way late seeing this thread but I will say I have an independent dealer that came from one of the big brands and absolutely solid guy, carries most of the brands you listed and a few more and is always reliable and has good prices. Not sure if this is a pro or a con but he also has his own sorta premium you can pay monthly/yearly and you get so much off the items and some free stuff but has never pressured anyone to join",86
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,20,\+1 for Mobile tool network,5
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,21,"Thanks, I’m set up with them. So you’d give an independent a try? And you think an independent can bring enough to the table without shiny new epics and company flag?",31
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,22,Nice! It makes me nervous because I haven’t seen any independents out there in my area.,16
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,23,Was there certain things you liked his truck for over the flaged trucks? What would you like to see on one that showed up?,24
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,24,"Yes that’s right, I’ll have to float the ra. I’ll purchase inventory from a variety of different wholesalers.",18
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,25,"I plan on taking care of my own warranties out of my stock, then send it in later. The tricky part will be how far does that extend? Obviously I’ll warranty stuff I sell, but if someone has a product I sell and they didn’t buy it from me, I’m not sure if I should still cover it? I’m guessing it’ll be depending on the customer and the relationship.",69
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,26,"No probably won’t deal much in boxes, except maybe used. Again a bit harder when I have to carry the note on everything.",23
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,27,Thanks! That’s actually why I started thinking of going independent. Lol,11
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,28,So you’d give an independent a try? You think there’s a market and a place for them?,17
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,29,Yeah looking at wholesalers it’s going to take a lot of shopping around to be competitive. Amazon is tough to beat. And in many cases I probably just won’t be able to.,32
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,30,Oh really? Looking around it seems like a pretty plausible enterprise to me. I’m nervous for mostly previously mentioned reasons.,20
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,31,"On the snapon side here. My guys buy from me. They love the brand, but a large part of the loyalty is to who they buy from. I don't think you would make the same amount of money going independent as you would with the snapon brand at your back, but you would be free to do what you want as you want.",63
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,32,"I been in 22 years so I like to see new shit. He carried a bunch of gear wrench, sunex, Milwaukee, Monster, but he could get you anything you wanted.",30
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,33,Coyle tools is another independent guy on YouTube that might be worth your time to check out.,17
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,34,"If I had an independent truck coming to my dealership I would spend way more than I’d like to admit. I personally buy tools of quality, price and convenience. I think an independent truck would provide the perfect mix of all 3. I think there is a good market for it.",51
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,35,You aren't going to be able to beat Amazon on price. You may be able to find some wholesalers to buy things 5% cheaper than Amazon but you won't be able to make a living selling cheaper than Amazon.,39
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,36,"You will be selling service, convenience and easy payments.",9
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,37,For sure. I think whatever the truck it should have as much as possible loaded in it and some of the oddities or new stuff you haven’t seen.,28
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,38,"And that’s kind of what I was thinking. I’m a bit afraid that it’s not as exclusive as a brand like snap-on. You can buy most of this off Amazon, and in many cases just a bit cheaper. I’m hoping having it in stock, financing, good service and warranty is enough to convince someone to buy from me, rather than shop the truck and go home and purchase from Jeff bezos.",71
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,39,"Personally, I prefer to keep my money local as much as possible and try not to support the huge guys like amazon, etc. The older I get, I see the importance of supporting the independents. I'll pay more (within reason) and give up some convenience to do business with people that I like.",53

unknown,unknown,25,"Is your question asking for help to see if your parts are compatible, or to help your price-performance/cost of total build? Right now, you are overspending a lot in various parts of the build and unfortunately have purchased the mobo already. As for performance and cost, I’d recommend a 360mm aio for better looks and airflow although the tower cooler should be ok without heavy overclocking. Motherboard would’ve been better as z690 + ddr4 since z790 is expensive and not really useful for the cost unless you use ddr5 (z690 is cheaper and has boards supporting ddr5 too). As for the ram, try to get the lowest cost of ram that’s 3200mhz cl16 or 3600mhz cl18. For the case, 5000D is ok but overpriced imo. I’d look at cases like lancool iii or o11d and more budget g360a or lancool 216. Psu definitely doesn’t need to be 1000w platinum, look at",151

I chose the z790 over z690 because this particular board has a lot more back panel inputs that are useful for my work and the devices I have. The other thing is that I'm hoping to get the fans, the cpu cooler, the ram, possibly the case, or money to help purchase them as Christmas gifts. So with that, and that I'm not buying any new storage or OS, I feel okay with spending a bit on other parts.",98
unknown,unknown,2,I've heard that AIOs can be overkill and less reliable than fan cooling. Do you have a AIO you'd recommend? And do you have a particular wattage you think I should get for a PSU?,35
unknown,unknown,3,Ah I see. For aio I’d recommend Arctic freezer ii as it has quiet operation and great cooling performance (also has a vrm fan on the pump). For wattage I think 1200w would be safer (I roughly estimated by 750w times 1.5 and added 100w since you have 3080 ti which can have voltage spikes). But 1000w and even 850w would probably work without problems (could limit oc potential).,69

Lately I've been having some fairly strong twitching and jerking, usually from my legs but sometimes my abdominal area, and mostly at night. I've heard from a few people that the more (antipsychotic) medications you switch around the higher the chances of developing some form of movement disorder. Is there any truth to this or has anyone heard/experienced similar?",80
z9ejuh,BipolarReddit,2,"What you're experiencing is called myoclonic jerks and is often caused by antipsychotics such as Zyprexa. I have experienced the exact same jerk in my legs at night when trying to sleep. It feels like an uncontrollable urge to jerk your leg, it's incredibly annoying but after about a month I stopped getting it.",54
z9ejuh,BipolarReddit,3,If you're still getting them after a few months your doctor can prescribe you medication that can help reduce the jerks.,21

z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,0,Are Entrepreneurs competitive?,3
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,1,"Currently planning my transition from sales to opening a small business, likely going to be a sole proprietor. I’m reading a lot of books on entrepreneurs which involves studying the traits of the best ones. I noticed they constantly say how passionate and persuasive and purpose driven they all are which describes me great (I think everyone is to a degree so I know I’m not special)",67
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,2,"However, as a salesman, one trait that drives me and has stood out to me is my competitiveness. It has led me to a lot of my success as I desperately want to feel superior to my colleagues who I really don’t feel any respect for. Back when we worked in office, I was quite ruthless and would bully, manipulate, and mislead my colleagues to make them perform worse so I could beat them on the leaderboards.",77
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,3,Some of the most gratifying experiences in my sales career was being number one and completely beating some kid in numbers who would always bully me back and would try humiliating me whenever he saw I was lower energy/burnt out as well. I loved seeing him feel envious of me and my peers saying things like “I have no clue how you do it”,64
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,4,I’m curious though if this level of competitiveness will help me as I become a business owner? I’ve seen stories of business owners who act similar but haven’t read much on it. Would appreciate some insight. Thank you,38
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,5,"It is a healthy trait to feel competitive but your view of it is all wrong in my opinion. You do not want to see yourself as ""superior"" to your employees, you want to set an example for them. A superiority complex will get you into trouble down the road and cause issues you don't need. It's the biggest difference when transitioning from an employee to a business owner, you no longer have to prove yourself amongst your peers but the goal is to show you care and are in the trenches with them. Never run a business with an ego, employees should be seen as equals. This has always been my philosophy and it has worked out very well for me.",122
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,6,The good ones are,4
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,7,I think you'll struggle with this attitude,7

z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,10,"You have to learn from competitors and people in tangential industries. There is a degree of sharing stories, connections and insights required for you to be successful.",27
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,11,"You have to be extremely humble, recognising your initial proposition might not hit the mark, continually tweaking it until it starts resonating with customer.",24
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,12,Competitiveness is not a great trait. Gamesmanship is. And being a competitor is part of being a gamer.,18
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,13,"I think you are goign to have real trouble with your business if you are focusing on taking other people down or making them perform worse. Being a gamer means you have everyone rising around you but you're still confident you can beat them. You are not confident at all. So honestly, you're probably very beatable.",56
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,14,"You don't have the right mindset to be an entrepreneur. Being an entrepreneur requires constant learning, even from your competitors. Obviously, you don't.",23
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,15,"You are Machiavellian… it’s normal to be competitive but it’s not normal nor ethical to manipulate people for you to get ahead.. I would feel embarrassed to get ahead that way (your way) … I’m all up for competition but the way you described your way to compete is just vile in my opinion … now , I see business as a competition but I usually beat my competition the right way, by putting in more work than them, just for fun.. not to feel superior and humíllate anyone nor mislead nor manipulate them… I would just simply outwork you even if you did all the manipulation , misleading , disrespect in the world I would still win by working smarter and harder as I have always done .. there’s a reason people have always hated me for being an over achiever.. but nope I’ve just always outworked everyone , i don’t compare my self to anyone, I set my own bar and it always turned out to be the highest one of all..",174
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,16,"The core competitiveness of an enterprise is the entrepreneur himself. An enterprise is not strong, but permanent.",17
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,17,I think one of the quickest things you will learn in running your business is that your biggest competitor is yourself and your business. It comes with a lot of challenges that I don't think you will have all the same luxury or mindset of an employee who gets to be competitive with other employees who aren't responsible for keeping the lights on. Healthy competition is needed to be a an entrepreneur but I would think you need to have more grit than anything.,84

How is healthy competition shown as an entrepreneur?",51
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,23,well i’m a woman so probably…,6
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,24,"I can tell you that as a business owner myself, I have to deal with all aspects of my business rather than my dedicated role when I used to be employed.

z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,25,"Yeah you’re right, I’m thinking it’ll be a few years till then for sure but would be fun to do with the sale team when it does happen.

This was about 6 years ago. It was so infected, they couldn't sitch it together and instead gave me antibiotics. It was yellow and green colored wounds. I took them. Weeks later I had a checkup and they looked at my head and said it was fine. But years later since, I've been experiencing pain at the back left of my head, and the front left of my head. It will happen randomly. I'd say three times a year, but when it does, it last for around 3 weeks on end. I've been to the doctor since. All they do is give me pain medication.

z9fh5j,Anxiety,14,"I'm in my 40's and have had issues with panic attacks, anxiety and depression since I was 20. At least that's when it broke out. Looking back there were a lot of signs that something isn't right in my youth and childhood.",42
z9fh5j,Anxiety,15,"I haven't had a panic attack in many years, I still tend to worry too much and look out for potential dangers that could be too stressful to me.",29
z9fh5j,Anxiety,16,"But I have made a lot of progress over the years. Since it was such a gradual progress, it sometimes feels like I haven't learned anything.",26
z9fh5j,Anxiety,17,"I have to remind myself that I did, by remembering how it used to be and how much everyday tasks, like buying groceries were a huge problem back then.",29
z9fh5j,Anxiety,18,One of the things I learned was that my anxiety can be triggered by my thoughts but also how I feel physically.,22
z9fh5j,Anxiety,19,"Due to my anxiety disorder I learned to ""scan"" my body in stressful situations.",14

z9fh5j,Anxiety,24,That feeling of not being in the presence and feeling disconnected from reality is something I know from my panic attacks.,21
z9fh5j,Anxiety,25,"You can look for the triggers, because as far as I can tell, from my experience, I could always find a trigger. It never came out of nowhere, at least in my case.",33
z9fh5j,Anxiety,26,"Idk, for me the worst is migraine anxiety coupled with I-just-had-an-argument-with-my-partner anxiety. Thankfully I have a kind partner whose reassurances keep me from going off the deep end.",28

z9fh5j,Anxiety,28,Maybe because final (college) week is approaching? My grades are fine though. 😞,13
z9fh5j,Anxiety,29,"So I’m on a medication that helps with daily “normal” anxiety, like normally in my day I would feel a constant sense of foreboding. But occasionally I will get an actual panic attack that my normal medicine can’t handle, like this one. Usually it’s triggered by something like watching something scary, but sometimes it feels like there’s no cause like this time. When that happens I take an as needed pill that in around 30 min calms me down. I don’t use that one often, it’s kind of for emergencies I guess because otherwise I’d probably want to go to the ER lol",103
z9fh5j,Anxiety,30,"That’s true, I will admit prior to it actually getting bad I had noticed that I felt off for around an hour or two. I should have probably taken my medicine then in order to prevent it, but for some reason I’m really bad about taking preventative measures. I’m always like “maybe it will go away” or “maybe it won’t get too bad” when in reality I should take it as soon as I start feeling it coming on so that it doesn’t get bad in the first place",89
z9fh5j,Anxiety,31,Finals could be factoring in a little bit subconsciously maybe?,10
z9fh5j,Anxiety,32,"I am trying to learn to not find a cause for it.

z9fh5j,Anxiety,33,Had that happen once 😩,5
z9fh5j,Anxiety,34,You can ask yourself what made you feel off?,9
z9fh5j,Anxiety,35,I am on medication and if I don't take it I will feel the effects of the medication wearing off and that's not pleasant.,24
z9fh5j,Anxiety,36,Idk if that's what you mean.,6

z9fh5j,Anxiety,43,"That's just one example, you can look for the thoughts in your head that probably just want to protect you from harm, had their time and place in your childhood, but haven't grown like you did.",36
z9fh5j,Anxiety,44,They still want to protect the little boy/girl that expresses itself in the emotions you feel.,16
z9fh5j,Anxiety,45,"It can be a rabbit hole, but ask yourself the next time you are anxious what root lies beyond that specific fear?",22
z9fh5j,Anxiety,46,Fear of loneliness? Fear of failure? Fear of lack of support?,11
z9fh5j,Anxiety,47,I know that I have a fear of failure. I associate failure with emotional pain.,15
z9fh5j,Anxiety,48,"Worthless, lazy, inadequate etc.",4
z9fh5j,Anxiety,49,"I have to teach the part of me, that has this automatic response of thoughts to failure, that failure means much more than just these negative traits.",27

z9fh5j,Anxiety,52,"How strong you have to be to be a worthy human, how you have to behave in certain situations, etc.",20
z9fh5j,Anxiety,53,"And I think these things can collide with the needs of that child in us, that is expressed through our emotions.",21
z9fh5j,Anxiety,54,That child is sometimes to weak to meet these demands and then we suffer emotionally.,15
z9fh5j,Anxiety,55,"My way to bring these to together, the ""parental values"" and the needs of the child is to be the rational adult. The referee, talkmaster, whatever to bring these parts together.",31
z9fh5j,Anxiety,56,"They both have their arguments. ""You should do this and that. You have to be like this"" and the ""I can't to this. It's too much.""",26
z9fh5j,Anxiety,57,The role of the adult me is to hear their arguments and find a middleground.,15
z9fh5j,Anxiety,58,"If I have an appointment I am scared of and my emotional (child) response would be to hide and don't do it, the other part says ""but you have to do it (or you are a failure)"", I give the alternative to try it.",44

z9fz47,pharmacy,0,How do i deal with this pharmacy?,7
z9fz47,pharmacy,1,"Im a pharmacist at an independent in a small city. Right down the road from my pharmacy, a couple of the chains closed due to short staffing. We are getting an influx of patients transferring in from them which is obviously great for business but theres just one problem...",49
z9fz47,pharmacy,2,"They're still billing fucking prescriptions over there. So i call them up, wait on hold for more than 2 hours, and am eventually told that the pharmacy is closed due to staffing so they have no ability to reverse claims. They tell me to call a different store and do a central lookup/reversal. Fine. I call a different and still nearby store, wait on hold another 45 minutes, and ask them to reverse these claims for me. They tell me they cant do the central search or whatever and that i HAVE to call that specific store to have it done. So i tried calling the original store again and was told for an hour and a half that the pharmacy staff were ""on lunch"". I called back one final time and was told that the pharmacy is closed, try again tomorrow..",142
z9fz47,pharmacy,3,Patients that go over there are apparently being told the pharmacy is closed and turned away. I called Medicaid to ask about override possibilities and was told the dr would have to submit a PA for early refill with attached paperwork indicating that the pharmacy that originally billed the RXs was closed. In some of these cases by the time all of that actually gets done and submitted correctly the medication will almost be billable again anyway.,77
z9fz47,pharmacy,4,Where do i go from here? is this not reaching the point of insurance fraud? Does anyone know any chains in your area that operate like this?,27
z9fz47,pharmacy,5,sounds like Walgreens.,3
z9fz47,pharmacy,6,"the good news is, if it is in fact a Walgreens, the prescriber might be able to help you. When they send an eRx WAG software automatically bills insurance 99% of the time (bad for those of us trying to take care of Walgreens refugees. But likewise, when the prescriber sends Walgreens an electronic cancelation of the same script Walgreens software automatically reverses the paid claim 99% of the time. So save yourself some hold time and ask the prescriber to cancel the Walgreens Rx electronically. A lot of my local docs have gotten used to this request and start by cancelling the Walgreens eRX before they even send us the reordered eRX.",113
z9fz47,pharmacy,7,"Ran into this on Turkey Day with a Walmart. Of course, I’ve also had to break it down for a couple of walk-in clinic NPs that 1) I can’t access another store’s voicemail to get the script you left after closing. 2) I can’t see the e-script you sent after they closed either. It was like teaching a dog algebra.",60
z9fz47,pharmacy,8,"If you continue to have these issues, contact your state BoP and initiate a complaint. Situations like this definitely effect a patient's ability to receive their meds in a timely manner. This problem also hinders you ability to tend to your current patient's needs.",44
z9fz47,pharmacy,9,"We leave it up to the patient. ""Walgreens has a paid claim. have them reverse it."" If they can't get it done, offer to cash it out with the understanding that we may be able to rebill it when Walgreens reverses the claim but no promises. Not the greatest service, but if you act like it's the patient's responsibility from the start, they usually accept that.",66
z9fz47,pharmacy,10,"This is happening to us with 2 different CVS’s close by. They’re closed 1/3 to 1/2 of the time and peoples rx’s are still getting billed due to their auto data entry. I’ve filed complaints with the BOP and am instructing every single patient that transfers to us to do the same. If there’s no one in the pharmacy, auto data entry should be disabled.",65
z9fz47,pharmacy,11,"Report them for Medicare fraud. Fax a transfer request, and 24 hours later file a state board complaint for failure to comply with request to transfer.",26
z9fz47,pharmacy,12,Do BOTH of those for every single RX that has this happen. I promise it will get fixed within 1 week.,21
z9fz47,pharmacy,13,"I have a similar situation, but I'm not nearly as patient as you are to wait on hold for an hour. But in my area if we can't get ahold of anybody we just leave a voice-mail with all the information for transfer/reversal. This depends on your state laws if you can do this for a transfer, but if you are waiting on a reversal and have other stuff to do just leave a voice-mail the pharmacist should eventually get it and do it themself.",85
z9fz47,pharmacy,14,"Those stores are probably over 4 days behind on scripts,so they are just doing scripts for whoever walks in their store and ignoring the phones as much as they can.",30
z9fz47,pharmacy,15,Have your patients initiate a complaint to the state board. Do NOT submit the claim yourself.,16
z9fz47,pharmacy,16,"Have the patient call and get it reversed. They don't have any other customers to help, you do. Sure the situation sucks but have the patient and their doctor work it out, they are the ones who sent it to the closed store in the first place.",47

z9fz47,pharmacy,18,"When you're calling for these copies, just make sure or tell the pharmacist to return or reverse the billing claim. If you got a new script from the doctors office and the pharmacy has it billed, just tell the patient they have to call and have the pharmacy reverse their claim or they'll have to pay cash price. I've been on hold with Walgreens and CVS for 30+ minutes before being able to speak to anyone and we can't do that and do our other jobs.",86
z9fz47,pharmacy,19,Contact your state board.,4
z9fz47,pharmacy,20,Their corporate structure is potentially harming patients (in addition to giving you unnecessary stress/wasted time).,15
z9fz47,pharmacy,21,"Beyond how to get the prescription billed and filled for the patient, you should let the BoP know about this situation. I believe OK had to have walgreens attend a BoP meeting over the summer to address concerns about unscheduled closures of stores and the negative impact on patients (delay of care, closing pharmacies in a rural area, etc).",59
z9fz47,pharmacy,22,You report them to your licensing body and tell the patients why they have to pay cash and give them the info to report to their insurance and the pharmacies licensing body.,32
z9fz47,pharmacy,23,I would call your state board of pharmacy. Sounds illegal to charge insurance for a prescription you never sell.,19
z9fz47,pharmacy,24,"That does seem like fraud. Bill and not fill. Bill and fill and not dispense, and then perhaps never reversing. Auditable by a PBM as well.",26
z9fz47,pharmacy,25,Bill out of pocket for all generics. Keep your price cost +12$. Save yourself time and effort. Brand names dont worry about filling them.,24
z9fz47,pharmacy,26,This is also a Walgreens thing…,6
z9fz47,pharmacy,27,"If, say, pt’s ins was billed at Wag A, then Wag A closes on the day that pt needs the med. Pt can go to Wag B and get their med by paying out of pocket completely.",37
z9fz47,pharmacy,28,"Then when Wag A opens, either pt or Wag B (preferably the pt ofc) calls Wag A to reverse claim. Pt then goes to Wag B, ask them to rebill their ins, and get a refund on the oop cost (which can be done if claim reversal and rebill happen within 7 days)",53
z9fz47,pharmacy,29,"If it’s part D, call the fraud and waste hotline for whatever insurance it is. Tell them you are trying to fill scripts for their clients but Walgreens has billed these claims without filling them which is fraud. You could get a 10% whistle blower payment for whatever fines they may levy agains Wags.",54
z9fz47,pharmacy,30,Can you answer a question for me in inbox,9
z9fz47,pharmacy,31,"I have two stores in my chain that closed down where this was happening. Unfortunately a lot of scripts were “lost” for a day as they transitioned from one store to another, but for the most part they transferred through central search just fine. But the store where all the prescriptions are going was absolutely overwhelmed, as I’m assuming the store you called also was, and obviously only the pharmacist and a couple techs were experienced enough to have good standard answers about this. A store closing or weird internal transfer issues are not something that happen all the time. The stores that closed really didn’t have the ability to field transfer calls—they were busy taking inventory and packing/shipping out all the drugs to my own store (which was chaos).",130
z9fz47,pharmacy,32,"I’m pretty sure, if only they had the time, the store you called could put in a ticket with their third party help desk. But they are probably dealing with 100 similar issues.",33
z9fz47,pharmacy,33,Email the state board and tell them the situation. Paper train. Lets close down those pharmacies for good.,18
z9fz47,pharmacy,34,"That sucks, OP.",3

z9fz47,pharmacy,37,Bring the list of orders to that Chain’s district manager biweekly and have them reverse those claims overnight,18
z9fz47,pharmacy,38,"Whoa that is crazy to me that they bill an Rx before a human being even looks at it, and is a terrible practice if they can’t keep their stores open for business and there’s no other way to reverse the claims.",42
z9fz47,pharmacy,39,I honestly would consider lodging a complaint with the board of pharmacy for delaying patient care with this practice. Maybe if they are fined/inspected enough due to this bullshit they will have to reconsider this practice?,36
z9fz47,pharmacy,40,"Thank you ! This may be the play ! i wasnt sure about rules naming pharmacies, one is walgreens but the biggest culprit right now is actually a rite aid. Do you know if they have a similar auto-reverse feature in their software?",43
z9fz47,pharmacy,41,It’s like they think we have access to all drug info for every patient,14
z9fz47,pharmacy,42,Just for future for future info….WM pharmacies started closing for Thanksgiving. We’ve always closed for Christmas.,16
z9fz47,pharmacy,43,"This is the way. Make sure the wheels of government know about the issues. Create a paper trail. If they refuse to act, the media will have a field day with it. Report it to your local and regional news. I did with the NYT and it made a big wave in the industry.",54
z9fz47,pharmacy,44,> 24 hours later file a state board complaint for failure to comply with request to transfer.,17
z9fz47,pharmacy,45,Not all states make it mandatory to transfer prescriptions. It is considered a courtesy. If the patient wants their meds at a new pharmacy have the MD cancel the original rx and send a new one to the new pharmacy.,40
z9fz47,pharmacy,46,I have just taken to faxing a reversal request.,9

z9fz47,pharmacy,48,"If it's not a control drug just pull the Wag A rx to wag B, then store it at Wag B. This will reverse the billing. You can't pull controls so if it's control you're still SOL",37
z9fz47,pharmacy,49,Why wouldn’t you just transfer the drug and auto reverse the claim? That’s the entire point of the system at Walgreens.,21
z9fz47,pharmacy,50,Even if it’s not part D insurance plans want to know about these access to care issues. If there are many of them we can audit all lines and start taking back claims they can’t prove were picked up but it doesn’t do anything in the moment. Us non-dispensing pharmacists out there feel for you!!!,55
z9fz47,pharmacy,51,All it takes is data entry to get a paid claim and tie up the insurance. Will probably sit in a queue for 4-5 days before actually ready for dispensing at a retail pharmacy that is understaffed,37
z9fz47,pharmacy,52,"This is true for every retail pharmacy, though… You type the Rx and get a tentative claim through their insurance. The claim isn’t billed to the patient until they pick up the Rx, but still ties up any more claims for that drug. This prevents duplicate claims, and is a form of preventing insurance fraud.",55
z9fz47,pharmacy,53,"Rite Aid floater here - am pretty new - so far I've not seen an automatic reversal feature that works externally (we have an internal feature that lets us pull things from other Rite Aids without having to call them to back it out - this doesn't work with other pharmacies), but the doctor can cancel prescriptions and it will show up in the pharmacist exception queue as a cancel request that we have to approve or deny, requiring immediate action (even if we're behind, that is extremely hard to ignore as most of the time there are only up to 5 things in that queue). At the very least, if the pharmacy is open it won't be ignored for very long, and only requires their fingerprint to cancel the prescription.",131
z9fz47,pharmacy,54,"Yes they do, but if the prescriptions are in transition from one store to another, it may not work properly. I believe the prescriptions have to go through some system transition where they change from central to local at another store. The scripts should not be “stuck” as billed at the closed store for forever or even for more than the first couple days of the transition though. If the matter is about a maintenance medication, I would suggest waiting a few days for the dust to settle and then seeing if the pharmacist at that store can find the RX at that point. That store is probably also understaffed and now suddenly has to field 100 extra calls about transfers. You can try a less busy store and see if that works. Or even just having the patient fill it one time at that pharmacy that received their prescription.",150
z9fz47,pharmacy,55,"No there is no auto reversal feature. When a Dr sends a cancel request it has to be manually acknowledged by the pharmacist on duty before it is reversed out of the system. If it is ready to be picked up at a Rite Aid, another one could pull it from their system and put it on hold at their new location. At that point an outside pharmacy could possibly bill for it no problem. But if something is ""in process"" at the original Rite Aid, meaning they billed the claim but maybe it is in Ready to Fill or needs the final pharmacist verification or something, even another Rite Aid can't pull it without contacting the first one to have them cancel it back. I've had this happen many times and it's a bitch to have to try calling the original store to tell them to back shit out before they fill it so we can.",157
z9fz47,pharmacy,56,When we're they open on Thanksgiving? My walmart pharmacy has been closed on Thanksgiving the 6 years I've been there.,20
z9fz47,pharmacy,57,What state doesn’t require a pharmacy to transfer an RX at the request of the patient or patient’s agent?,19
z9fz47,pharmacy,58,For Walgreens - just find an open store and if patient needs the Rx quickly - call and explain the circumstances. Have them pull the script over to that store and to put it on hold (as long as it’s not controlled or have a complicated billing). If the patient doesn’t need it immediately- fax over the transfer request and put a note on it.,65
z9fz47,pharmacy,59,Another way is to have the Md send a cancel Erx over.,12

z9gflb,NoFap,1,"Is quitting porn for 90 days useless? I wanna quit so I can gain my sensitivity back. I used to take these sleeping pills that made masturbation feel good but they stopped working completely and now i feel frustrated af. I just want my sensitivity back but don't see a reason why I should quit for life, I don't have a girl or women to chill with even though im attractive or friends to hang with because i'm shy af and lack social skills. I joined kick boxing to get in shape and meet people but it's hard for me to talk to people there. I don't have the balls to off myself so I just sit in loneliness and frustration all day. Trying dating apps but my matches never respond back even though they text me first which is confusing to me. All I do is work and I wanna buy some things like a car and clothes but I can't save money for shit so I end up broke in like a week. I really don't know what to do beside quitting and getting that feeling back so I can have something to enjoy.",196
z9gfyg,asktransgender,0,ELI5: WTF is progesterone for?,5
z9gfyg,asktransgender,1,"I’m 14 months on E and spiro and I still don’t understand when you take progesterone, why, and how it’s different. All I see are debates and confusion about boob growth or horniness and I’m totally lost.",37
z9gfyg,asktransgender,2,"The effects of progesterone vary, both physical and mental. Physical, it affects fat distribution, though the kinds and levels of effect vary, but many do like what it does. It does indeed affect libido for some. For some, it gives them more energy (but also sometimes needing more sleep). Mentally, the effects are all over the place, with some reacting very well to it and it being the best thing since sliced bread and others absolutely hating it, and everywhere in between. For me, it is an extremely strong anti-dissociative (mostly a good thing) and the physical affects have been rather mild but still nice subtle changes.",107
z9gfyg,asktransgender,3,"The short answer is that medical science doesn't know exactly what, if anything, it does for transfemme people. There are anecdotal reports that it helps with/helps complete breast development, that it helps with feminine fat distribution, that it increases libido that's been lost as a result of E and antiandrogens, that it can have positive mental health effects, positive effects on sleep, and a variety of other effects that people list, but that's all anecdotal. It's really up to you whether you think that anecdotal evidence is sufficient to be worth trying it. Personally I tried it, had bad side effects, and stopped; my sister tried it, saw very positive mental health effects and no side effects, and has stayed on it.",122
z9gfyg,asktransgender,4,"Best I can tell, we have no freaking clue. Some say it helped feminization, some say it hurt, some say it did nothing. Some say it should be started after a year, some at tanner 3, some never. It definitely shows up in cis girls puberty, but science isn't exactly sure WHY. With so much anecdotal evidence, and a near complete lack of scientific basis (even among the extremely undeveloped field of trans science), its up to you if you wanna talk to your doc about it. I'm still new to HRT (only 5 mos) so I of course have no first hand experience with it myself.",107
z9gfyg,asktransgender,5,"I’ve been on it for maybe a year? My boobs are rounder, sure, I sleep easier at night, my sex drive came back after a year on spironolactone… but I can’t really say with absolute certainty that any of that wouldn’t have happened as a result of spiro and e alone. That’s the real challenge - isolating just the effects of progesterone. ::",63
z9gfyg,asktransgender,6,"The small-ish community, years of stigmatization of trans issues and lack of money that can be extracted from said small-ish community has left us mostly in the dark. The answer is, as bad as cis female and minority science is, trans science is worse. Basically, white men are rich, and medical research wants moola, so white men get the science.",60
z9gfyg,asktransgender,7,"That's why these communities have formed, and what makes this whole thing so tough for a lot of people. If the medical scientists aren't going to figure it out, we have to make due.",34
z9gfyg,asktransgender,8,"The only thing we all know for sure, is that you can look up cis female hormone timelines all over the internet. Progesterone comes into the female body something like tanner3 to tanner4, as menstruation begins, increases over time until a steady state, and then spikes as women get pregnant. Some say that female breasts don't come into full maturity until pregnancy, where they generally swell in preparation for feeding babies.",71
z9gfyg,asktransgender,9,"I have this idealized, compressed cis-female schedule, where somewhere between recognizing tanner 3 and tanner 4 starts, introduce small amounts of cycling progesterone, and increase it slightly over time. And as I feel like I'm nearing the middle to end of tanner stage 4, try to convince my doc to POUND that the progesterone into me, to simulate a pregnancy, for a short while. Pregnancy is a dangerous time for a woman, and progesterone has it's own list of side effects, but I want to look outwardly like a woman so bad, I'm going to do this ""experiment"" as close as possible to what women go through!",107
z9gfyg,asktransgender,10,Am I insane? Eh. I'm just a girl who wants to look on the outside how I feel on the inside.,21
z9gfyg,asktransgender,11,"And of course, YMMV, IANAD(I am not a doctor), take the things I'm saying with a grain of salt, do your own research, this is not medical advice, etc.",29
z9gfyg,asktransgender,12,It’s an hormones that comes lately in the « female » body and that helps polishing every aspects of it. So we take progesterone too to apply the same effect to our new « puberty » process 🫱🏻🤩🫱🏻,38
z9gfyg,asktransgender,13,"I heard that it's the hormone that spikes during pregnancy, so when taking it, your body thinks you're pregnant and acts accordingly. What could that mean? I dunno",28
z9gfyg,asktransgender,14,there's kind of a snippy exchange in the literature between Prior (https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2018-01777) and Iwamoto (https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2019-00249) about whether medical science has adequate clinical knowledge about progesterone in transgender medicine.,28
z9gfyg,asktransgender,15,Prior's position is that progesterone is clinically indicated for trans women with the following expected benefits:,16
z9gfyg,asktransgender,16,"> (i) more rapid feminization, (ii) decreased endogenous testosterone production, (iii) optimal breast maturation to Tanner stages 4/5, (iv) increased bone formation, (v) improved sleep and vasomotor symptom control, and (vi) cardiovascular health benefits.",34
z9gfyg,asktransgender,17,"It may be necessary to try. Depending on the individual setup, it can be metabolised to a number of substances including e,t and DHT. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trans_Resources/wiki/hormones/transfeminine/index#wiki_bioidentical_progesterone) may be more.",28
z9gfyg,asktransgender,18,*hugs*,1
z9gfyg,asktransgender,19,IDK why people down voted this. Currently there is not enough scientific evidence to really say anything. Some places straight out won't prescribe it because of this. I can not get progesterone through my national system because of this exact reason and have to use a separate provider.,48
z9gfyg,asktransgender,20,"i guess i should add that Iwamoto, et al. disagree. they conclude that clinicians should wait for WPATH SOC8. unfortunately, WPATH SOC8 says:",23

I'd like to do a clerkship out of law school but I understand the very elite schools are best for this, and obviously they aren't taking me. For clarification, I think I'd just like to apply to maybe 5 schools just to see what happens, but most likely will delay for a year and really pump up that LSAT score. I think with some intense studying I could have a 17low going into cycle. Who are some decent schools who may actually accept me and maybe even give me a bit of money.

z9glvq,guns,0,Is there an image repository or dimensionally accurate collection of drawing I can use for my business?,17
z9glvq,guns,1,"Let me explain, I own a laser and CNC business. I’d like to start offering my services to laser engrave and carve on guns. I figured I’d start with pistols and move on for there.",35
z9glvq,guns,2,"I know I can go on Etsy and buy a bunch of templates for a group of guns, but I’d like to do my own artwork and scrollwork with my own templates.",32
z9glvq,guns,3,That said I would like to know if there is some sort of database or image repository I can access that has dimensionally correct profile images that I can use to create my own templates?,35
z9glvq,guns,4,Maybe this isn’t the correct place to ask for something like this but I thought I’d start at the source and go from there.,24
z9glvq,guns,5,"Buy a Glock slide and do it right, then branch out from there. Are you really considering experimenting with customer guns?",21
z9glvq,guns,6,"Well, there's 3D models and some website that does handgun comparisons. I think it has images with dimensions.",18
z9glvq,guns,7,"If you can't find the dimensions, start out with glock and hit the other big name flagship pistols like the sig p320 and S&W m&p 2.0. If you need the gun you could buy used on the cheap. Even LEO trade in's can be pretty cheap depending on how worn it is. If you only need the shape and not the function it should work.",65
unknown,unknown,0,"Absolutely not! That would be a very expensive experiment! I have ran this business for many years an am very familiar with engraving different materials but in this case it’s more or less having 10 - 20 of the top handgun templates ready to rock so if a customer comes in with one of the handguns I already have a template for, I don’t have to spend an hour or more making a template, I can just swap the artwork to what they want and go.",86
unknown,unknown,1,The other idea was to sell the templates on the side for other laser guys to use in their business.,20
unknown,unknown,2,"I have engraved a few Glock slides and already have a couple templates but there are a lot of people that don’t have a Glock so rather then buying slides for a bunch of different handguns, I figured I’d see if there we any image databases I could use to save some time and money making the templates.",58
unknown,unknown,3,"Thank you, I did look at them but 3D is hard because you never know if the designer added something or took something away because they thought it looked better or didn’t render as well with it so 3D is tough to trust in the accuracy. I can compare them to actual images but doing that for 100 guns could be incredibly time consuming.",64
unknown,unknown,4,It did dawn on me that the pictures being dimensionally accurate isn’t really a problem as I can simply scale the template up or down accordingly.,26
unknown,unknown,5,Most important is that the images be flat profiles with the gun flat on a table and that both sides of the gun are the same. Other then that it’s just a matter of scaling the design which is very simple.,41
unknown,unknown,6,I’ll probably just end up taking my own photos.,9

z9hdxy,legaladvice,0,Question about the handling of inheritance,6
z9hdxy,legaladvice,1,This is in Wisconsin,4
z9hdxy,legaladvice,2,When my mom passed away 6 years ago my two brothers and I inherited her house. After the probate lawyer filed the deed for all three of us to own the house our oldest brother (A) came forward and said he couldn't have his name on the deed because he owed 40k in child support.,55
z9hdxy,legaladvice,3,The lawyer's solution was to have A sign a quit claim deed but the lawyer stressed that my other brother and I had to compensate A with something of equal value to his share of the house.,37
z9hdxy,legaladvice,4,We were all broke at the time so I suggested that we could sign a document saying if we sold the house we'd give him one third but that we would need time to draft the document before A signed the quit claim deed.,44
z9hdxy,legaladvice,5,It turned out that A went to the lawyer and signed the quit claim deed before we could make any such document (he is kind of dick so we were trying to draft a document that wouldn't accidentally give him more power over us than he would have had as an equal home owner). We got distracted by my estranged dad passing away and the busyness of daily life and we ultimately never drafted that document.,76
z9hdxy,legaladvice,6,Now it's 5 years later and due to A's increasingly toxic behavior I threatened that if he didn't stop treating us like crap I would kick him out of the house. He countered that he would take me to court over the quit claim deed and force the sale of the house to make sure no one had the house.,60
z9hdxy,legaladvice,7,"I've been doing my research and I plan on talking to a lawyer but since the quit claim was signed, notarized, and filed with the register of deeds over 2 years ago and my mom's will and estate was also over 2 years ago I'm almost positive that he can't do that.",52
z9hdxy,legaladvice,8,"What I was really hoping you folks could fill me in on is: was the lawyer correct when he said that A had to be compensated for giving up his share of the house or was he just passing his opinion of how we ""needed to stick together"" off as something we legally had to do?",56
z9hdxy,legaladvice,9,Edit: The child support he owed was paid in the interim,11
z9hdxy,legaladvice,10,"I'm not a lawyer, but I think what is going on here is pretty ugly. You may have some liability here.",21
z9hdxy,legaladvice,11,> (A) came forward and said he couldn't have his name on the deed because he owed 40k in child support.,21
z9hdxy,legaladvice,12,"This sounds like ""A"" is trying to fraudulently hide assets to avoid paying child support (with your help).",18
z9hdxy,legaladvice,13,>the lawyer stressed that my other brother and I had to compensate A with something of equal value to his share of the house.,24
z9hdxy,legaladvice,14,"This sounds like the lawyer trying to cover his own butt by recommending that the three of you refrain from fraudulently hiding assets to help ""A"" avoid paying child support. But this really is not the lawyer's issue, since he represents the estate, not you, and the estate was settled by the house being deeded to the three of you.",60
z9hdxy,legaladvice,15,>was the lawyer correct when he said that A had to be compensated for giving up his share of the house,21
z9hdxy,legaladvice,16,He's correct in the sense that it's not a good idea for three of you to form a conspiracy to hide assets that should be going towards your brother's child support obligation.,32
z9hdxy,legaladvice,17,>he would take me to court over the quit claim deed and force the sale of the house to make sure no one had the house.,26
z9hdxy,legaladvice,18,He is full of crap on this (and apparently many things). He does not own the house.,17
z9hdxy,legaladvice,19,"But I think you are in legal jeopardy here. The value of A's share of the house should have gone to pay his child support obligation, but instead you got it. This needs to be fixed. If that means selling the house, so be it.",45
z9hdxy,legaladvice,20,You should see a lawyer to see how you can pay this money back without criminal charges. Do this proactively will be much better for you than if the state comes after you for it.,35
z9hdxy,legaladvice,21,Edited post to reflect that A paid the child support in the years since. (He used the money from his dad's estate to pay it),25
z9hdxy,legaladvice,22,I will bring that up with a lawyer when I talk to them though. Thank you for the advice.,19
z9hdxy,legaladvice,23,"That makes a huge difference, obviously. But what he (and you) did 5 years ago could still be a criminal act.",21
z9hdxy,legaladvice,24,"At this point you own the house. He does not. It's up to you as to what if anything you want to do about this. If he tries to go to court, he would have to argue that you promised (verbally) to help him commit fraud, and then failed to follow through on it. It's a bit like a drug dealer getting ripped off in a drug deal and then calling the police because someone stole their drugs.",78
z9hdxy,legaladvice,25,Talking to a lawyer is a very good idea.,9
z9hdxy,legaladvice,26,"Edit: just rereading the whole post, there is no legal ""obligation"" for you to compensate your brother for his share of the house. Apart from the whole child support thing, it's perfectly legal for your brother to receive a share of the house as an inheritance, and then deed it to you as a gift. The issue in court would be what if anything the two of you agreed on at the time.",73
z9hdxy,legaladvice,27,"Again, thank you very much. Due to the multifaceted nature of this issue I've been trying to figure out what kind of lawyer I need to talk to about this and this has narrowed it down considerably.",37
z9hjel,flightsim,0,Question for Vatsim controllers,4
z9hjel,flightsim,1,"So I have done at most 2 or 3 flights on Vat sim before, but it's been a long while and want to get started again, had a question for controllers. Lately, I've been doing practice flights in the F-16 OR F/A-and mainly just like to cruise around. From what I remember, a flight has to be to a different airport than the one you took off from, but do you think controllers would mind if I did some back and forth patterns in the process?",86
z9hjel,flightsim,2,"For example, a lot of my flights consist of me taking from Edwards AFB and flying around in the restricted airspace. If I took off from Edwards and did that then landed at say Area 51 do you think controllers would mind as long as I clearly stated my intentions. So it wouldn't be a direct flight and I could even provide a route to help to say I will be flying this specific pattern.",75
z9hjel,flightsim,3,"There is no requirement that a flight has to go from point A to B, as long as you have a coherent flight plan and follow ATC instructions/basic regulations. If you're in uncontrolled airspace, you can basically do anything within the code of conduct.",44
z9hjel,flightsim,4,"I'm not sure how the airspace is structured around KEDW, but you may or may not be in contact with LA center. You can always ask the controller, but be prepared to operate within whatever clearance they give you. You should also respect that they're probably busy, and VATSIM isn't really the place to request a high speed pass over LAX during a Friday night.",65
z9hjel,flightsim,5,Thanks. I wouldn't request anything that crazy. I usually dont fly supersonic out side the proper airspace and in this instance make sure to request any high speeds. Usually I fly around M.85-90 so only slightly faster than airliners.,39

z9igab,CAguns,0,CA Gun Laws and LEOs,5
z9igab,CAguns,1,Gun newb here. Does anyone know the history behind CA LEOs being afforded special privileges that regular Californians aren’t. Or can point me in a direction where I can read about it?,32
z9igab,CAguns,2,"Pretty sure the short answer is that they have a strong union that can heavily influence policy. The perceived importance of an endorsement from said union during election season gives them a decent amount of influence (this may be waning in recent years). And despite some of the current rhetoric, being soft on crime still hurts your polling.",58
z9igab,CAguns,3,So said union pushed for LE exemptions when the laws were being written.,13
z9igab,CAguns,4,Someone smarter/more knowledgeable on legal history will give you a better answer.,12
z9igab,CAguns,5,"If you want to know the history, look at the law that allows it and find that law's legislative history. It's available on Lexis or Westlaw, but if you're not a lawyer with a subscription to one of those services, pop down to your local law library and ask the librarian to help you. It's all there.",57
z9igab,CAguns,6,"modern california law is based on humiliation, not truth justice or reason.",12
z9igab,CAguns,7,A lot comes from them being issued guns not available to civilians as well as full capacity magazines. They often carry at least the issued handgun home. Some departments have their LEOs buy their own equipment so they get access to the full catalogue of guns.,46
z9igab,CAguns,8,"Same reason why LEOs must be 20.5 years old before starting an academy. Because if they were younger, they couldn't enter bars to enforce the law.",26
z9igab,CAguns,9,"They just have to comply with the law, and it was easier to just give them an exception paragraph when they were writing the law.",25
z9igab,CAguns,10,"I think a big part of it is ""obviously the dogs of the state get privileges"" and another part of it is, ""they're professionals, so they can handle it, and you're not"".",32
z9igab,CAguns,11,Cops always have special privileges lol! Ya I just found my dream Glock 45 going for hair under 2k and almost bought it before finding another one for $1500 both were new never fired. I knew that was the best price I’d find since I’ve been watching the market for a while.,52
z9igab,CAguns,12,On a side note if your interested in a 19x get the G45 (9mm/Gen5) it’s the same gun just better and black in color. Just like why staccatos are going for 5k all day long and people pay it! I do know that Most departments do limit to 1-2 guns a year and also require a chiefs/sergeants approval letter to purchase any off roster guns. Unless your a sergeant or higher up I don’t think they can get more then a couple new guns a year without it being a problem or causing red flags!,95
z9igab,CAguns,13,Gotcha. That seems consistent with the information I’ve gathered from using the searchbar on this sub.,16
z9igab,CAguns,14,"I’m browsing the CalGuns marketplace section as we speak and it blows my mind that there’s so many people flipping off-roster guns for 2-3x or more msrp. Insane. G19X, P320s and 365s…HK USPs, Sig Five-Seven, FN SCARs…..lmaoooo what the fuck",40

z9igab,CAguns,17,"Absolutely false. All that’s needed to purchase off-roster is a department LEO ID. A department letter is only needed to skip the 10-day wait. I’ve bought at least a half dozen off roster guns in a year before, never had an issue.",42

z9iosk,legaladvice,0,Divorce not yet filed but new job?,7
z9iosk,legaladvice,1,"Seems that divorce is definitely looming. We are in VA. We both would like a no fault, but husband hasn’t worked for 3 years and has secured a job starting within 2 months making $250,000+.",35
z9iosk,legaladvice,2,"How do I address this when dividing assets including pretty minimal bank account (under $10,000 total)?",16
z9iosk,legaladvice,3,I'd imagine you just split what you have and anything from his new job will be his?,17
z9iosk,legaladvice,4,"Did you support your husband for the three years he was unemployed by working? If so, it looks like to me you should ask for spousal support or the 10k bank account if your living standards will be now be lowered and your income is much less. Probably good idea to go to divorce mediation if you want a no fault divorce.",62
z9iosk,legaladvice,5,"Not entirely . We were using profits from sale of our home for expenses but as that was being depleted, I also did have a job. I’m not looking to get anything but don’t want to give up half of what we have when he know that he has this job. We previously owned our house free and clear and made a little over $106,000 per year so I’m getting used to my living standards being much lower than they had been.",82
z9iosk,legaladvice,6,I simply wanted to know if I could retort about the possibility if he pushes things beyond reason.,18
z9iosk,legaladvice,7,"I suppose you now rent and that can be a lower standard of living than home ownership that you once had during a portion of your marriage. Will you need to move to a cheaper apt? Whereas on a salary of 250k he can much more easily get a house (or luxury apt )and build equity again. Doesn’t seem fair that you cant participate in this largesse. If you are older don’t rush to divorce or if you don’t like your job! Not sure if the split is mutual. He seems to have it easy, not working for years and then being able to secure a high salary job that is much higher than his previous salary. The much higher salary jump seems off to me. You are entitled to maintain your same standard of living as you had during the marriage - that’s where the spousal support comes in. Also if you have been married for 10 years you are entitled to 1/2 of his social security earned during your years of marriage if it’s higher than yours at retirement and if he passes before you, you get his full social security. That could come in handy in your later years if he earned more than you. Seems like to me if you wait until he actually secures his job and it looks like he’ll keep it you would be better off getting some spousal support. You must have good health care too. If he has a retirement plan from past employment during the marriage you would be entitled to share in that. VA is an equitable distribution state, so the Court would look at what is fair. That might be much more of the 10k left for you from the property division. Its not 50/50 like in a community property state. It’s best to get your own attorney.",310

z9j4ty,nzev,8,The usual fee has been around $150. It's well worth doing.,11
z9j4ty,nzev,9,Welington and Christchurch have people who can do it. This is where Facebook EV groups have an edge being long established.,21
z9j4ty,nzev,10,Pretty sure there's threads about this on the NZ Leaf owners FB page.,13
z9j4ty,nzev,11,"From memory, the Nissan dealer option is a no-go. Nissan dealers barely want to know about Leafs, even less about imports.",21
z9j4ty,nzev,12,That sounds promising. I saw some info for older model leafs but not sure if it’s possible for the 2020 model with the “Nissan Connect” control panel. Mine is the “ZE0” type. I’m based in Wellington. Will see if possible to track something down.,44
z9j4ty,nzev,13,"Thanks for the tip. It must be a common question and I wasn’t aware of that FB group. I’m thinking a dealer might be able to handle if if it’s technically possible and one pays them enough, lol.",38
z9j4ty,nzev,14,Gazley in Wellington may be able to help. EVs Enhanced in Christchurch are also worth talking to. They are arguably the most advanced technicians in NZ for customising LEAF firmware. They devised the solution DriveEV offer if I remember correctly.,40

z9j4ty,nzev,16,A 2020 will be a 'ZE1',6
z9j4ty,nzev,17,As I understand it there already no NZ maps available for the ZE1 but Carplay and Android Auto should work,20
z9j4ty,nzev,18,"Thanks, I’ve emailed EVs Enhanced (who look pretty legendary) hoping they can shed some light on the options. I’ll try contacting Gazley too to see if they have any suggestions on it. There must be some way.",37

There’s just some Japan quirks such as the speed limit warning will suddenly jump to show a random Japan map and sometimes it says good morning in the afternoon (though the clock is correct).

z9jbnl,researchchemicals,2,what are the effects u got? i always enjoyed snorted MET a lot,13
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,3,Is it freebase? Don't you need to make it into a salt to be able to snort it? As far as I know if it's free base you can only smoke it. I am skeptical boofing will work if snorting didn't. I don't know about the smell.,47
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,4,YOU GOTTA BOOF9999,3
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,5,"Snorting 4-ho-met doesn't make it stronger. None of the psilocin analogues work better intranasally. Take it in a capsule or roll it in toilet paper and take a larger dose if it's not strong enough for you instead of trying other roas. Oral bioavailability is not an issue with these substances. A good rule of thumb is that 1g of shrooms is 10mg of psilocin, so 45mg is not a super high dose when it comes to psilocin analogues. Especially considering that I've seen psilocin analogues at 90% purity and there could be even worse batches than that.",98
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,6,"I would say, it's possible your issue is purity of the product, but Idk what kind of tolerance you have. The issue is not bioavailability.",25
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,7,I also don't know what you mean by mild. What effects are you looking for? I don't get a strong visual experience until I get close to 70mg.,28
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,8,"I've never snorted it, but I've taken pretty high doses vaped/smoked, probably over 100mg. No matter how hard I tried, it never got super deep.",25

z9jbnl,researchchemicals,20,"I am talking about MET, the unsubstituted variant, related to DMT. Orally you need a load of that, like 120-150mg according to psychonaut, if i remember correctly. That's why I want a way which requires less material",37
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,21,"I have no tolerance, i haven't done psychedelics in a while. It might be purity, but I am not sure anymore, considering someone else also reported to be this way nasally, and that it has to be smoked for stronger effects. But the smell is really fucking off-putting",48
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,22,"By mild i mean no visuals apart from brighter colours, headspace consisting only of inner-peace and very mild euphoria/mood lift and mild bodyfeel (warmness, mild numbness, a little bit of tingling, feeling comfy)",33
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,23,"Okay, that's kinda surprising. Good to know.",7
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,24,How intense does it get when vaped?,7
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,25,"Yeah, makes sense. I mean, it's good, just not what I expected. I still like it",16
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,26,"Nope, I mean MET, the unsubstituted DMT relative",8
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,27,"Also, with 4-HO-MET, i would recommend boofing, it's considerably more potent than oral",13
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,28,My source is pretty reliable and i weighted it myself with a pretty decent scale.,15
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,29,With metocin i would be in another universe with that dose lol,12
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,30,"at doses of 25-30 mg i get some nice mild visuals relaxation euphoria and mood boost i used these doses to go out in nature and just appreciate nature more i wasn’t really tripping, vaped the visuals get a lot stronger and it gets trippy i feel like snorted could be more recreational",53
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,31,"Maybe it's just bad quality then. Boofing should be stronger than snorting, and unless it hurt snorting it shouldn't hurt either when boofing. So maybe it's a better way but probably still not gonna be anything great.",37

z9jbnl,researchchemicals,33,Boofing is life.,3
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,34,But fumarate tryptamines provide relatively little added value when snorted or boofed. Boofing in excess can also cause some legg blood vein damage.,23

z9jbnl,researchchemicals,36,I've put mine away for a while but next time I explore it I'll use in conjunction with psilocin or DMT.,21
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,37,"Me too, it's good, it just doesnt have the kick that some do",13
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,38,"Makes sense, i can see that. Maybe it's just different than i expected, as from what you're saying, the effects i got don't seem too far off. I just expected it more intense. I wasn't really tripping either, while I did expect a trip. And i mean, it was nice, don't get me wrong there",55
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,39,"How can you was it? The smell is awful already when I snort it, and if I had to vape it... Ew",22
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,40,"Also, how easy is it to vape, is it pain in the ass like DMT?",15
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,41,"That's also possible. Who knows. It hurts a little snorted, but compared to other shit it's fine. It shouldn't be a problem boofed. I'll try boofing some other time...",29
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,42,"I figured, i mean, if it's like this snorted, it's not likely to be that much better boofed, but still worth the try i guess. Even the effects from it are very meh",33
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,43,"No worries, happens",3
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,44,Indeed.,1
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,45,"It does, it lowers the dosage needed tremendously",8

z9jbnl,researchchemicals,48,That combo sounds pretty good,5
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,49,Exactly,1
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,50,its not super difficult to vape actually i didn’t mind the taste while snorting and vaping its completely fine for me. I actually like the effects a lot of MET it grants me somewhat of an „inner-peace“ feeling,38
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,51,For sure. I am curious how it will turn out. Maybe MET is not a very good drug either. Its analogous compound 4-HO-MET is much more popular for some reason haha,31
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,52,"How do you vape it, with what method?",8
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,53,"You probably have a different, better batch. For me the smell is very much not okay, as I said, it smells like dead fish shit.",25
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,54,"Yeah, i like that too, it was probably the nicest part of it. In kinda similar fashion to DMT, but not nearly as strong.",24
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,55,"Looking bad, it was actually kinda good, just not as strong as i would expect",15
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,56,Kam curious too.,3

Different animal, but I think the same principles apply: be completely honest. Don't even try to act like you're hiding anything or try to sugarcoat it. That got me through. I've never been military, so I have no idea what penalties (beyond being denied a clearance) you might or might not be facing.

I like the anger and sadness that permeates all songs, and I really enjoy the raw sound which blends synthesizers with instruments and reminds me of the industrial genre but with a modern take.

z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,45,"Thought you were a novice or something honestly from the piece of the pic shown above in the post, then I saw your lower body and other pics.. your calves are absolutely massive very impressive.. is it genetics, or do you have the best calve training routine in history? I’d love to know what you do for them, you seem to be lower body dominant so getting yoked will truly round you out imo",74
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,46,"Program looks solid bro, run it and keep us posted with your progress!",13
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,47,"Your legs are looking good, so is your arms and delts. Middle back is ok but your chest and lats are lacking. What grip do you do your pull ups with? It could also be a form issue for why you're not developing those areas more. Are you using full ROM and getting a nice stretch on the pull ups and chest exercises?",63
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,48,"Your frequency isn't really mentioned, so I'll say this. Arguably the two most important muscle groups for developing the ""yoked"" look are the shoulders and upper back. Shoulders are definitely emphasized in your program, but due to how quickly shoulders recover, one of the most important variables in training them is going to be frequency. Finding ways to increase delt frequency without compromising joint health can be key. For most guys, the upper back seems to be able to handle even more volume and frequency than even the shoulders, so (and again being mindful of joint health) it's super difficult to overtrain your upper back, and if we want it to grow maximally we should probably be training it with greater volume and frequency than most other bodyparts. I could give you some suggestions in this area from my own experience if you'd like.",144
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,49,"One thing I noticed looking at your pictures is that while your shoulders and arms do look pretty well developed already, your chest may be considered a weakpoint. The program you've written disproportionately focuses on upper chest and shoulders, but seems to neglect the greater portions of the chest which for most people are more receptive to growth. This shouldn't necessarily be a concern depending on the physique you're going for, but a big part of getting that thick, girthy look is developing a chest that projects away from your body, and this will be almost entirely lower and mid pec. Again, this is just goal specific so feel free to ignore",112
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,50,"Physique wise I'd say lats, rear delts, lower back, and neck could be better. Chest seems decent but you can never have too big of a chest imo.",28

unknown,unknown,4,Think I might just look into the RP Chest and Back specialization program or something similar now that all agree on those weakpoints!,23
unknown,unknown,5,Rom is looking good. But do a slightly narrower grip to target the lats more. The lats get better leverage when the upper arm is closer to the ribs.,29
unknown,unknown,6,"It's not an upper lower split, but there are also upper lower splits with A and B days which have different frequencies",22
unknown,unknown,7,"Yeah that sounds good,, you have quite a few pieces of the ""yoked"" physique covered already and you look good. I think you'll get there man, good luck on your journey!",31

Class got cancelled today, and no in-person class tomorrow so I won’t be running into you during my return to school. I always wonder how you’re doing. Are you doing anything better? Different? Or are you just chillin at home on the Xbox I got you and turned into your only hobby? Is he still brainwashing you with sweet words?",83
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,4,"I went to Seattle two weeks ago. I’m going to LA in two weeks. We were supposed to go together in two weeks with the guys, remember? Things have been going well for me though, as much as it probably doesn’t seem like it since I’ve been so quiet. I’m 170lbs for the first time since I played college ball, lost 23lbs since the breakup. I remember you saying you liked the chunkier me, because you could mess around and tease me. I dunked again for the first time in years. You would’ve been excited to see it, at the gym we used to go to together. I haven’t played video games as much, they remind me of the amount of time I spent playing with you. I don’t get the thrill I used to anymore. I got contacted by our university’s baseball coach. I might end up playing. I remember you got upset at me for choosing you over sports. It’s okay; I was happier with you.",168

I haven’t been road raging, I know it’s a miracle right? Even in COD, I still play CW by myself sometimes. Haven’t been getting mad. The guys and girls have been wondering about you, since you haven’t been speaking to any of us at all lately. A told me she tried reaching out to you but you were too busy. They were a bit blindsided by everything because we were your best friends. We miss you, miss you playing with us, the car rides picking you up from work, getting boba, KBBQ, shoot even the occasional beers and wings. Everyone is wondering how you’re doing, and no they didn’t pick my side. I wanted everyone to be neutral no matter how close you thought they were to me. A and A are your friends, they wish you’d be around more.",175
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,6,"Oh, I went to the boba spot we tried before you left. The one on San Pedro, when even though we were in the process of breaking up, you were feeding me the Korean corn dogs while I was driving. I went by the park we used to bring Pepper to, just to shoot around a bit. Ran into some of the other dogs there. How has Pepper been? Your mom hasn’t updated me about him. I’m surprised actually, considering she still checks up on me. I hope he’s not too depressed, he was really unhealthy looking during the entire breakup process. I hope he’s been getting out of the house.",111
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,7,"Not sure if you saw on my brother’s snap or the other guy’s snaps, but I finally got that other piercing I was always talking about. For whatever reason I never got it until last month. I also started drafting that sleeve tattoo, my arms got a bit bigger so I was thinking maybe I’ll go with it. It’s hard to decide on what tribal style to get, and what baybayin script to put. Man it’s so fun but hard to decide! Switched my style up a bit, was getting tired of looking really bummy wearing shorts and hoodies all the time. I mean it didn’t change much, but I got a bunch of sweaters and crew necks I can wear out. I think you’d like some lol. That reminds me, you never gave me back my stuff. I have like a crap ton of stuff there. My spare glasses too! You mentioned it early on that you’d give my stuff back, but it’s been like 7 weeks since then.",170
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,8,"Idk if you’d be happy to hear this or not, but I started talking to an old high school crush and went on a couple dates. Sadly, I had to tell her the truth: I wasn’t ready to move forward with anything. I wasn’t ready to fully commit myself and my love into a new relationship. I wouldn’t have been my best for her. I know now that I’m just not ready to love someone else, I’m still working on myself. I remember how you didn’t like when I got attention from girls. It was always a cute thing when you got mad. I know, I know, I shouldn’t tease about it. You were the only one for me before, and until I find that next one, you’ll still have a place in my heart. Now I understand all those songs like “My Boo” and stuff. It’s crazy, I’ve been in tons of relationships and other stuff, but nothing ever hurt like this.",163
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,9,"Anyway, I hope you’ve been taking care of yourself. Toward the end of the relationship, you weren’t doing much for yourself aside from gaming. Have you been keeping up with your homework okay? I remember I was helping you with some of your business assignments and accounting papers. I wish you got out more. Just take care of yourself please. I know you’ve been home from the Philippines for about a week now. I’m glad I haven’t had to run into you around the city, would’ve been awkward. I plan on meeting up with your mom when she gets back too, I have presents from my family to you and yours. I won’t be giving you any sadly. That’s his job now.",122

z9l9ue,confessions,0,I am starting to have feelings for someone I shouldn't have feelings for.,13
z9l9ue,confessions,1,"To start with, I am \[18M\] and is quite the outgoing social type of guy. Recently this college, I've had a friend whom I'll call King \[19M\] have a crush on someone on our block, let's call her Anne \[18M\]. Me being the outgoing social guy I offered to help King have a chance with Anne by first befriending Anne and then providing information about Anne's preferences and thoughts to King to help him understand her more.",77
z9l9ue,confessions,2,"Long story short, I was quite the social friendly out going guy so I've managed to befriend Anne to the point she's comfy to share her personal secrets to me. You could say I've managed to crack her guards down. Just to add Anne is quite the introverted shy person, she's quite secretive in which is the reason why King struggled to know her and accepted my offer of help.",70
z9l9ue,confessions,3,"I've noticed that the longer I interacted with Anne I seem to have gain feelings for her, and it hurts me and my conscience every time I think of it; I feel quite scummy about having feelings for her as originally I only intended to help King set up with her. At first, it was subtle it was probably due to the trust Anne had in me for her to trust her personal secrets to me that made me feel warm, she's even quite pretty to speak of. Normally, we would walk together after college, since I'm the only guy she's quite comfy of but there was one instance where King and Anne was walking together. And I was at the back. I acted I supported King as I was openly supporting them due to my original intention at first to befriend Anne.",143
z9l9ue,confessions,4,"That was the moment, I realized I've gained feelings for Anne. I've never felt so self torn at that moment, I felt so jealous at King and so angry at myself for having feelings at Anne. I'm so angry and sad for why did I even fell for Anne. I've never felt so scummy ever before. I do not want to ruin my friendship with King just to have chance for Anne and I don't really want to tell Anne that I've gained feelings for her. I do not have any idea on what to do. I want this feeling to be gone but the more I push it away the stronger it comes to haunt me back. I genuinely hope for this feelings to be a quick happy crush but at this rate I'm despairing it won't just be a quick happy crush. I genuinely do want to ask your opinion on how should I proceed with this. I do not want to ruin my friendship with King nor do I want to tell Anne that I have feelings for her. I do want to get out of this situation but I do not know how.",197
z9l9ue,confessions,5,But if telling Anne that I have feelings for her is the only way out of the hole I've digged myself in. I'll do it.,25
z9l9ue,confessions,6,"PS: I apologize for any grammar mistakes, I am do not have English as my first language.",17
z9l9ue,confessions,7,What you should do is tell King that you have feelings for Anne. Then decide what to do from there.,20
z9l9ue,confessions,8,If you still want to be friends with King then don't but if you don't care tell Anne you've been telling other people shit she shared with you and see how it works out,34
z9l9ue,confessions,9,Fuck king go for it,5
z9l9ue,confessions,10,I would rather tell Anne I have feelings for her than King.,12
z9l9ue,confessions,11,"I haven't shared any personal secrets of Anne towards King. Actually before me and Anne got friends, I always asked her what she thought of King and I would always ask if King had a chance. I also did told her that I befriended her due to King and I'm thankful I did because I got to know her better. I also already told her that I would forward to king what Anne's preferences are but never her personal secrets.",80
z9l9ue,confessions,12,I am such a coward. For even doing this. I can see how much comfortable Anne is with me and it makes me feel so warm whenever I think of it. She used to sit alone or always sit randomly at our classes but now she always sits around next to me and I think it's sweet. But I can't just be a scummy bastard who steals his friend's crush.,70
z9l9ue,confessions,13,So you are willing to lose King as a friend?,10
z9l9ue,confessions,14,your feelings are a little inappropriate and disrespectful to King. is King even your friend?,15
z9l9ue,confessions,15,"Shoot your shot, but don't expect king to stay friends even if he says he doesn't mind.",17
z9l9ue,confessions,16,"Your friend is the coward and you would be betraying her, yourself and probably breaking her heart if you did nothing and left her to that idiot",27
z9l9ue,confessions,17,I don't know man King is quite also straightforward to her about his feelings its just that Anne isn't quite comfy with him. I really don't want to fuck up with King but if I have no other choice I'll probably talk it out with her it's just that I'm still hesitating.,52
z9l9ue,confessions,18,"Just tell her how you feel, if she's into you just tell your friend you tried to set him up with a date and she said no because she was into you",32
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,0,Got backstabbed at the pre-sale for the show in Amsterdam,10
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,1,Yesterday I received an e-mail regarding the pre-sale that was promised by Abel and the XO team for previous ticket owners of the After Hours tour.,26
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,2,"Back when the After Hours Till Dawn tour was announced, Abel put out an instagram post in which he explained the reasoning for cancelling the previous dates. He also stated that previous ticket owners would receive priority in buying tickets for new dates.",43
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,3,"So yesterday I signed up for the pre-sale link. It stated that because I had bought tickets before I had early access to the tickets. But then I saw a TikTok add from Mojo (the promotor of the tour in the Netherlands), which stated that by clicking the link and signing up to their newsletter, subscribers would receive the link to the pre-sale as well.",65
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,4,So I asked my friend to do just that and it turned out that people without previous tickets would also get access to the pre-sale.,25
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,5,I realized that it would be a hassle to get tickets since everyone had access to the pre-sale which was promised to only the previous ticket holders.,27
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,6,And today I didn’t manage to get the tickets I was promised and instead was waiting in a queue behind 20.000 others (that is more than the capacity of the previous venue).,32
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,7,"It’s safe to say I am deeply disappointed in the way this was handled and I honestly feel betrayed by the XO team and Abel. I don’t know how much they could’ve done about this and if this was truly their fault, but they failed to keep their promises and I am gutted.",53
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,8,"As a longtime XO fan this was my first time seeing Abel live and I was waiting in excitement since 2020, but I honestly don’t feel like going through this process again tomorrow at the regular ticket sale.",38
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,9,"I’m sorry for ranting on here, it just feels as though there is no real place to address this to the XO team other than to share my story with you guys.",32
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,10,"If anyone has experienced the same thing as me, then please let me know in the thread below!",18
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,11,Bro I was in the queue behind 22k people. As soon as I got to the end they put me back in the back of the fucking queue,28
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,12,"For those who are from Amsterdam, maybe you could buy tickets for Brussels in Belgium. I got mine at the presales and I just checked now (15.41h) and there are still tickets left at the presale.",36
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,13,"Same thing happened to me mate. I even had 3 tickets secured, transferred to my banking app to approve the payment, then after approving ticket master told me my details were incorrect. This happened for two different cards. I lost the tickets and now there aren't any left on pre-sale.",50
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,14,"We had three tickets bought for the arena tour. We were told we'd be given priority for the stadium tour and we haven't been. That combined with less tour dates, and some countries that had dates now being omitted from the tour, really leaves a bad taste in the mouth.",50
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,15,"Yeah that priority shit was a giant scam by Ticketmaster. I received no emails about a presale and I just had to make a Live Nation account to have access to pre sale. I was fortunate that the European venues were easy to get tickets to, but its absolutely horrid what happened in UK and France.",56
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,16,"Contact a customer union, get info on your local/national laws.",10
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,17,"Edit : TicketMaster don't give a shit, they don't even have a customer support in my country.",17
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,18,TM scammed us all. Went through a 20k line just to get placed back in line. Was lucky and tried my work phone and got through eventually. Paid a ton for those standing tickets man. Not to mention the pricing of the tickets in general,45

unknown,unknown,8,Same here.. fucking stupid 😭,5
unknown,unknown,9,Same,1

unknown,unknown,11,do you have a link to the presale perhaps?,9
unknown,unknown,12,yeah.. i get the need to upscale to stadiums but the fact that previous ticket-holders were not given the priority as promised really hurts,24
unknown,unknown,13,"The same happened to me got denied three times and then was given a message saying my time was up, luckily it went through somehow so roll on Marley park 🇮🇪",31
unknown,unknown,14,Wasn’t easy in the Netherlands either :/,7
unknown,unknown,15,"tbh don’t think i can do much, since we did get our tickets refunded back in the day, its just morally wrong thats all",24

unknown,unknown,4,Lol what a dick,4
unknown,unknown,5,"I got tickets today during the presale, but the seats are not very good. Is it possible that I can get better seats tomorrow during the regular sale or are all the good seats sold during the presale",38
unknown,unknown,6,"not sure, i also don’t know what venue ur tickets are for. all i know is that the tickets being sold tomorrow for amsterdam are behind the stage :/",29
unknown,unknown,7,"I dont think ticketmaster allows refunds, only ticket transfers/resale to other people",12
unknown,unknown,8,Realky? How do you know? I bought tickets for Amsterdam today,11
unknown,unknown,9,A resale is fine,4
unknown,unknown,10,because mostly the front sections were sold during the pre.. but i might be wrong!,15
unknown,unknown,11,They only have a certain amount of seats available for presale. They’ll be more in front tickets tomorrow.,18
z9mhep,relationships,0,BF broke up with me because I'm taking too long to heal from work-related trauma,15
z9mhep,relationships,1,Warning: long post!,3
z9mhep,relationships,2,"My ex (27m) and I (27f) met because we both worked/studied at the same place. He had been there a lot longer than I had, everyone there knew him and loved him. I was new, and still making an impression. I knew I loved him the moment I saw him.",50
z9mhep,relationships,3,"We started dating pretty quickly, and things were going well. But work started going downhill, I realised that one of my managers (33f) felt competitive with me and essentially hated my guts for no reason. I found out later that she'd had a thing for my ex. I tried a lot of mediation etc to get her to work with me in a civil manner, but that ended in a screaming match with her yelling at me in the middle of a hallway at work. This happened about a year into working there. When I tried to seek support from other managers (37m/55m), I was told that I was being selfish, two-faced and money driven. My relationship came up as being something that was apparently distracting me from work. I was incredibly damaged after this and I don't think I processed it as the pandemic had just started.",148
z9mhep,relationships,4,"My ex and I moved in together around this time. He is very close with his family and over time he told me they were my family too. For context, I have no family in the country where I work and a fairly small friend circle. He became my world, and I did any and every thing for him and his family. I could feel myself losing bits of me, but it felt easier to focus on the relationship, rather than deal with the reality of my managers at work.",90
z9mhep,relationships,5,"He did tell me quite early on into moving in together that it was stressful for him to be around me because I was sad and depressed about work a lot of the time, and he tried to leave me a month into moving in together. (He came back the next morning and apologised profusely)",55
z9mhep,relationships,6,"But we stayed together for 2.5 years after moving in together. Yes we had fights and he often said he needed space, but I thought we were working through it. He kept wanting me to be around his family, and I was okay with it, even though at times I felt they could be very overbearing. They often made jokes that would trigger my anxiety, and this was aggravated by the fact that i hadnt been able to see my family for over 2 years because of the pandemic. His family became my family, i baked cakes at all of their birthdays and i always got presents for all extended family members at Christmas. We often talked about marriage and children, even though he initially said he didn't believe in it, he said he could picture that future with me.",140
z9mhep,relationships,7,"Earlier this year, I got a new part time job that I really loved. But over time, I realised I didn't fit into his world anymore. I could feel us growing distant as we were no longer working together, and he wasn't very supportive of my new job. Around this time, I realised how much the incident with my manager had affected me, and I started getting help. My ex was not very supportive of my mental health journey, I thought it was because he had become numb to how anxious and depressed I always was. Our fights became more frequent, and his arguments became more personal as he would call me a terrible, rude person. I acknowledge my part in this as the smallest things would set me off, and I was getting angry and anxious at things that usually wouldn't bother me. But we still had our good times, we would still talk about our future together, and how things would be so much better once I was fully wrapped up at my old job and settled full time into my new one.",185
z9mhep,relationships,8,"Fast forward to two weeks ago, all my hard work of the year had culminated into a big week of events. I was very excited and hopeful for this week, as it was huge career wise for me. There was also going to be a party at my old work place- my ex's workplace at the end of that week and I wanted to go and say goodbye to my old colleagues. We went out for his brother's birthday at the beginning of that week and had a lovely time, I felt closer to my ex and his family than I have in a long time. On our walk home, my ex told me that he didn't want me to go to the party at his workplace because he wanted to enjoy himself and not worry about me getting anxious. I was upset that he felt that way, and the fight escalated until he said he hated our relationship and didn't want to be with me anymore.",167
z9mhep,relationships,9,"I was very hurt, but I acknowledged his feelings and we decided to take our space. My work events were successful, but I couldn't enjoy them because I was so devastated. He moved out to his mom's house after that week, and we tried to stay in touch but he put zero effort into keeping the conversation up. We met up a week later and I asked what was going on. He told me that he was firm in not wanting a relationship, and he didn't love me the way he should. I asked if we could work on it together, and he said no, that he needed to not be in a relationship for at least a month. And then maybe we could talk next year. I slept on it, and decided that it was unfair of him to leave me hanging for that long. I asked him to move all of his stuff out and I haven't seen him since. Ive said a lot of terrible things out of anger, asked to go NC and I fear that I've ruined any chances of reconciliation. It's been a week, and I still can't stop crying. The more time that passes, the more I realise how little he cared/loved me. I keep wishing he'll text, but he hasn't.",218
z9mhep,relationships,10,"I am so hurt and devastated that it ended this way after 3.5 years. I was so close to him and his family, and I feel like I'm losing a whole family along with this relationship. It's his birthday in a few days and I don't know if I should wish him. I feel so hurt and lost. I still haven't recovered from my workplace incident and I just don't know if I'll ever be okay again. Part of me wonders if he lost love and respect for me because I couldn't cut it at his workplace. Feeling really devastated and heartbroken- I gave this relationship my all when I had so little to give, and my anxiety has been at an all time high. I don't know if he even misses me. I keep blaming myself for the breakup and I don't know how to stop. Sorry about the long post, I just needed to get this out of my system.",162
z9mhep,relationships,11,"TL;DR: Boyfriend broke up with me as I am taking too long to process work-related trauma, and I am unable to see a way out of this",27
z9mhep,relationships,12,">we tried to stay in touch but he put zero effort into keeping the conversation up. We met up a week later and I asked what was going on.

z9mhep,relationships,14,"The way ""out"" to to start the process of moving on. He has made it clear he does not love you, like you, or like your relationship. He does not want to stay in contact and does not want to work on it.",43
z9mhep,relationships,15,"The way ""out"" is to work on your self-esteem until you're able to set healthy boundaries for yourself such as not staying with someone who not only thinks you're terrible and hates your relationship but says those things directly to you. You deserve better and you should believe you deserve better.",51

z9mrge,artbusiness,0,What do you do with a customer who decides that they don't like something about the piece that they bought?,20
z9mrge,artbusiness,1,"I'm an art photographer who recently participated in an open studio tour. I had a customer who liked a piece, asked me to have it printed 24 X 30 on aluminum. I delivered it. He opened it and noticed a couple places where there was black on the image. He said something was wrong. I showed him that those places were black on the original but told him that I could edit and reprint. I told him, honestly, that I want him to be happy hanging the work and that I would pay for the reprint. He returned the copy that he was unhappy with.",105
z9mrge,artbusiness,2,"I edited the piece, got his approval and sent out for a reprint. I sold the piece for $325. The two prints together will cost me more than that. So, last night I sent him a text and asked if he'd pitch in for the cost of the reprint. He has not yet answered. Now I go back and forth feeling like a cad for asking after I said I'd cover the cost and thinking that it's not unreasonable to not want to lose money on a sale where the client stared at the piece for a long time before asking for the print and it was delivered exactly as it looked when he bought it.",116
z9mrge,artbusiness,3,What would you have done in my place?,8
z9mrge,artbusiness,4,"Thank you for posting in r/ArtBusiness, please be sure to check out the Rules in the sidebar.",17

z9mrge,artbusiness,9,You can't really ask that after saying you'd cover it.,10
z9mrge,artbusiness,10,"If someone gave you something for free and then ask for something, you probably wouldn't.",15
z9mrge,artbusiness,11,"Next time, plan ahead and offer a reduce cost for the next print (maybe even at cost - make no profit but don't lose money).",25
z9mrge,artbusiness,12,"If the piece was $325 and the printing costs $100, you should have told the client, “listen, here’s what we’ll do. A reprint will cost $200. I’ll split it with you. Shipping will be about $50.”",36
z9mrge,artbusiness,13,"That would sound like you’re helping them out, when in fact, you’re not.",13
z9mrge,artbusiness,14,"Honestly, you can't change your mind on the price after the fact. If that same situation were to happen in the future you should send a digital proof for approval before you print & charge more for the reprint post proof approval because it's custom work. I understand reprints if the printer is faulty, but to replace a perfectly good piece is admitting fault where there is none.",68
z9mrge,artbusiness,15,"Thanks everyone. He offered to chip in an extra $50 and I told him that I'd stick to my original offer. The prints are almost $200 each, so I'll lose a bit on this sale. I'm just going to chalk it up to a learning experience.",46
z9mrge,artbusiness,16,"You can't change the price after you've already sent out the piece. That's very odd and unprofessional. Not making a reprint, or asking money for it ahead of time, would have been reasonable. But once you agreed to it, you can't really change it.",44
z9mrge,artbusiness,17,Maybe you can sell the original print to someone else and recoup some of the money that way? Assuming the customer doesn't agree to pay your new price.,28
z9mrge,artbusiness,18,Don't edit your shit after the fact like that. All sales are final.,13
z9mrge,artbusiness,19,"It depends. If the customer got something other than what they purchased, I try to examine what happened and eat the screwup. It has happened maybe 3 times in the last 5 years. If a customer got something as advertised, and make complaints, I do nothing to fix it. If they want to customize their print its $175 per hour for alterations with no refunds on the labor.",68
z9mrge,artbusiness,20,"The vast majority of people are good, but there is a small percentage of people who will take advantage of you and ask for things out of line. One example I had about 10-11 years ago was a guy who wanted to buy five giclee prints from me. Big order, but I have done it before. He wanted to show them to his wife, have her pick out one, and then return the other 4 and have me refund him his money. I told him these were all print to order and my business policy (which is stated on my website) is that I do not return prints that are not defective (and uhhh, if I delivery the prints and they look fine, and you tell me they are defective, we are both going to know you are lying).",139
z9mrge,artbusiness,21,"He responded with ""Well you know, at Costco you can return stuff, I don't see how this is any different"". I told him this isn't Costco, I am a small business, I do not have warehouses for inventory, he wanted stuff that i would have to pay for and then deal with. I asked him to show his wife pictures and then ask which one she wants ""I want it to be a surprise for her!, you know, something nice"". I explained that it was more or less me doing something for his wife as I would have to eat the cost. These were people who were probably 55-60 at the time. His wife is an adult. She can pick which one she wants on the computer screen.",128
z9mrge,artbusiness,22,"The other time I can recall was an institution where the manager had to approve of the picture. Everyone loves the art, but the manager wanted to make some color alterations. I am convinced they did so because they are a task master (look up the Bullshit Jobs book for the Task Master) and need to have their hands on everything, even things which do not actively require management. His job wasn't to make sure things look good, his job was to add steps so it shows he was participating. This is where the $175 per hour for alterations comes from.",101
z9mrge,artbusiness,23,"Usually, if someone buys something and dislike it, thats on them. Its my job to deliver what they ordered, not to cater to their every need.",26
z9mrge,artbusiness,24,"I hate to say it, but I agree, you can't go back on your offer. That said, I wouldn't feel too bad about asking, they might have been happy to do it and it all would have worked. You could now recover by writing back and saying after you had a minute to think on it you feel bad about asking and want to continue with your original agreement.",69
z9mrge,artbusiness,25,"And then you can chalk this up to the cost of education. Some people pay thousands to go to college, this was one of your lessons. In future you'll do things a little different.",34
z9mrge,artbusiness,26,Congrats on the sale!,4
z9mrge,artbusiness,27,"Yeah I have had this happen time and time again. Sometimes I worked for like 2.5$ an hour if you count it, because I would take on a huge project for like 400$ but then spend an eternity finishing the piece and then the client would ask for a revision.",50
z9mrge,artbusiness,28,Always makes me... aggravated.,4
z9mrge,artbusiness,29,So I bumped up the prices. You never know how the job will go or who the client is as an individual. Being an artist is a great journey - the career takes you for a friggin ride.,38
z9mrge,artbusiness,30,I don't think any of the Disney animators thought they would work at Disney.,14
z9mrge,artbusiness,31,"Well, I wouldn’t have asked for payment after saying it wasn’t required, but since that is where you are, you could either A. Leave it and not message them again or B. Send them another message apologizing for asking for payment and telling them not to worry about it, you can try to make up something about extra fees you were charged that you didn’t expect or something but it’s a bad look to have asked for payment after saying it would be free.",84
z9mrge,artbusiness,32,"1. Make sure the customer has access to very clear images of the piece, from multiple angles if necessary to show what it looks like with light reflecting off of it if that makes a difference, which in this case, it seems like it might.",45
z9mrge,artbusiness,33,"2. If this isn’t a commissioned piece, don’t offer to edit it. The EXCEPTION would be if there’s a glaring issue that multiple customers are noticing and pointing out. The customer not liking the use of black on part of the image is an issue with the customer’s personal taste, and not your work. Don’t sacrifice integrity to make a sale.",61
z9mrge,artbusiness,34,"3. If you’ve already stated you’ll cover the cost, *cover the cost.* Do not ask a buyer for extra money after you’ve stated you’ll pay for a reprint. You’re just going to have to eat that loss at that point. If you weren’t sure how to handle this, you could’ve told the buyer “I’ll see what I can do, and get back to you.” Then take some time to think about how to handle the situation or ask for advice if needed.",82
z9mrge,artbusiness,35,You cant ask for money from the client. You should always before printing get a client to sign a proof sheet.,21
z9mrge,artbusiness,36,"This way you are covered for this very situation. You'd of been able to show they approved the first print ""as is"".",22
z9mrge,artbusiness,37,"As you didn't do that and offered to edit and reprint at your own cost, you will have to just accept the loss.",23
z9mrge,artbusiness,38,You can put the first print up for sale though if its not a photo of the client themselves or a person without a model release.,26
z9mrge,artbusiness,39,"It happens ... an assumption of fees illustrates how critically important rates are. ""Let me verify another copy fee and shipping and I'll get back to you.""",27
z9mrge,artbusiness,40,"In the future , the price of your print should always be the cost x 2.5. This allows for errors like this, while adding a little wiggle room to make a profit in this worse case scenario.",37
z9mrge,artbusiness,41,Can you list it as ready to ship holiday offer and try to get a sale that way?,18
z9mrge,artbusiness,42,I did pay thousands to go to college and business school to boot. I know better. I'm not thinking straight.,20
z9mrge,artbusiness,43,He offered to kick in an extra $50 and I told him never mind.,14
z9mrge,artbusiness,44,"In fairness to myself, the customer saw the piece at an art show. He looked at it for a good ten minutes. He didn't take that physical piece only because I'd dropped it and there was chip on the edge where it hit the pavement and I insisted that he have an intact piece.",54
z9mrge,artbusiness,45,The original one ?,4
z9mrge,artbusiness,46,"so you flip flop on him, and then when he said yes, you flip flop again. and entire change was for customer who knew what they had.",27
z9mrge,artbusiness,47,"you gotta stop this, or you will never get off the ground",12
z9mrge,artbusiness,48,"Yeah, that would be odd, then, that he’d complain about the black color when he saw it up close and in person!",22
z9mrge,artbusiness,49,I can try. I don't sell a ton of my work and have never sold anything online.,17
z9mrge,artbusiness,50,You're right. I messed this one up.,7
z9mrge,artbusiness,51,I mean you’ve got nothing to lose,7
z9mrge,artbusiness,52,don't focus on what you did wrong. focus on what you did right. made a sale!,16
z9mrhh,developersIndia,0,Update: Messing up in WITCH company,6

z9mrhh,developersIndia,65,Its up to you if you want to stay in the same situation or not. I have seen some folks stuck in similar situation since a decade.

z9mrhh,developersIndia,82,"Better to not respond, and keep your sanity rather than keep wasting time for a manager/company that doesn't give two shits about you or the development process. Investing time in studying and trying to switch would be much better.",39
z9mrhh,developersIndia,83,Working hours are generally 9-6. Be responsive then. Outside of these hours they have no business demanding anything off you.,20
z9mrhh,developersIndia,84,they'll act like it's a big issue but they can't do shit if they're trying to contact you after work hours. especially freshers they try to take advantage since they're new to work culture and not seniors since they don't give a shit. also if you feel any meetings and working happens during personal time bring to manager. any half decent ones worth their salt will help you.,68

z9ny6c,ContractorUK,0,Is my umbrella company dodgy?,5
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,1,Hi everyone this is my first time posting here so apologies if it isn’t the relevant place for it.,19
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,2,"I’m a social worker who’s just left a permanent role and is now working through an agency. Before starting i had a few people warn me about going agency mostly telling me to beware of dodgy umbrella companies. I started my new role last week and everything seems to be going OK I submitted my hours to my agency on Friday and I’d already worked out on moneysupermarket that for my hourly rate and hours I should come home with around £850 per week after tax, NI and student loan.",90
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,3,"Anyway, yesterday I receive a phone call from a man who said he was from the umbrella company who worked with my agency and wanted to talk me through a couple of different methods of payment before my first wage comes through this Friday.",44
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,4,"He proceeds to offer me two options, please bare in mind I am not clued on on tax so if this does not make much sense it may be because I have not remembered the info correctly. He tells me the first option and leads with the amount I’ll be getting paid which was around £1150 per week. At this point alarm bells are already ringing as it is significantly higher than what I have worked out I should be taking home myself.",83
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,5,"He tells me all I need to do is put aside £72 per week and when HMRC come around in April I will pay them the money I’ve put aside and explained that this was just the accounting side of things (didn’t make sense to me but he carries on) he then says they will need to pay me into two separate bank accounts, one will have around 750 paid into it and the other will have around 350 paid into it and explained that 1 of the payments is ‘profit’ (I don’t understand what this means either?). He said if I choose this route they will send me a contract to sign - baring in mind I have already signed a contract when I first started with my agency. He also said I might prefer this route because I wouldn’t have to make any student loan contributions.",148
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,6,"He then said that the second option entails me being paid into 1 bank account and coming out with around £850 per week, my student loan contributions will be made and it is through a ‘PAYE’ method. He also said I will also be optics into a pension scheme which I can opt out of. This option seemed far less complicated and aligned with what I had already pre-empted my pay to be.",73
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,7,I told him I would have a think and let him know what I would prefer in the morning. I have done quite a lot of googling and have spent most of last night and this morning learning about umbrella companies and the horrendous loan charge scandal. From what I had learnt I felt option 2 would be the legit way and rang him this morning to say I would like to take the lower amount and make my student loan contributions he said this was fine and was polite enough.,91
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,8,"My first question is, is what they are offering illegal? My second is should I change umbrella companies completely? I’m fairly certain they are dodgy but I feel confident I have chosen the right option, I just don’t want to experience any trouble with HMRC later down the line from the collateral of any potential trouble my umbrella company might find themselves in. This is my first role outside of a perm contract and I am a fairly young social worker (24) this job is all I have ever done since graduating and I am passionate about it so do not want to do anything that might risk my career or future.",112
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,9,Any advice / comments welcome,5
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,10,tell your agency and move to paystream,7
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,11,Option 2 would be the legitimate option.,7
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,12,Option 1 appears that you would be declared as a company or as a sole trader. Its up to yourself but if you want the easier option and are happy with the amount I would do with option 2.,39
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,13,Is the contract inside IR35 or outside?,7
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,14,if its in the option 2 is likely to be correct.. if its outside then you should setup a ltd company and you sort your tax affairs yourself..,28
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,15,with ANY umbrella you should be logging onto your personal HMRC tax account to ensure they are actually paying your taxes for you regardless of what it says on your payslip - do this every single month regardless... HMRC have made it quite plain in the past that if they/you have been scammed out of your tax money they don't care and want it anyway from you pronto - with the dodgy options your being presented I would disengage from this company immediately...,83
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,16,As a side note I've used NASA in the past and they paid my taxes - notice I didn't say they were good... all umbrellas should really all be the same as you are essentially buying a payroll service thats it..,41
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,17,"Option 2, just make sure you're receiving your holiday pay and they're not skimming it off.",16
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,18,Worthwhile staying in the pension imo.,6
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,19,"OP, you've got your head screwed on just right. If an offer seems ""too good to be true"" then it usually is.",22
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,20,"If the end client is in the public sector then I'd suggest letting them know. I am not clued up enough on tax to know what ruse the brolly is pulling, but it feel pretty shady.",36
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,21,I hope I am not too late. Do not go with option one! An umbrella company that suggests paying money in 2 different bank accounts smell really bad... period.,29
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,22,"It is important to remember that Umbrella Companies don't have ""a statutory definition"" for HMRC. Therefore as long as HMRC is aware, an Umbrella Company is like a normal permanent employer. So it is different because you are now an agency worker but how you will be paid shouldn't.",49
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,23,We created this calculator where you can calculate your Umbrella Pay very accurately: [https://payslipbuddy.co.uk/umbrella-company-calculator](https://payslipbuddy.co.uk/umbrella-company-calculator),14
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,24,"If the money you receive is way higher than what was returned to the calculator, I would advise you to run. But anyway, based on what they suggested, I would leave them anyway. I can't see how option 1 is not a DR Scheme.",44
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,25,"The next thing you should do is create your tax account on the HMRC website. A few workers know this, but all workers can create a free account with HMRC and see each week how much income tax and NIC your employer (here the umbrella company) paid to HMRC: [https://www.gov.uk/personal-tax-account](https://www.gov.uk/personal-tax-account)",50
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,26,Hope it helps ✌️,4
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,27,Thanks I will look into paystream today,7

z9p1tm,travel,1,"Hello lovely people,",3
z9p1tm,travel,2,Hoping to get advice from someone who was maybe in the same/similar situation as I'm getting quite desperate.,18
z9p1tm,travel,3,As the title says - I have dual citizenship - 2 passports - one is EU (Croatian) and the other is non-EU.,22
z9p1tm,travel,4,"* Currently, I live in the Netherlands with my EU passport - all good, no problems there.",17
z9p1tm,travel,5,"* Due to an upcoming trip, as part of the visa application process, the South African Embassy took and kept my EU passport. Big disorganization, unprofessionalism, and the fact they are not telling me when can I get my passport back is another topic.",44
z9p1tm,travel,6,"**Question** \- I must travel outside of the EU next week. I think exiting the Netherlands with my other non-EU passport should be ok - I don't think they care, but how does it work when I want to enter the country again? Can they decline my entry? *(I should note that I have never entered the EU with my non-EU passport so If I leave now, they will only see that somehow, I'm in Europe now, trying to leave it and then trying to come back) .*",88
z9p1tm,travel,7,"And no, I don't have an EU ID - that is my mistake - first thing ill do once I get my passport back.",24
z9p1tm,travel,8,&amp;#x200B;,1
z9p1tm,travel,9,"Edit: I could not find one person to tell me it's a good idea to leave the country with a non-EU passport so I decided not to risk it. Missed a flight, spammed the embassy with calls until I got my EU passport back, and booked a new flight. (Spent a few hundreds extra in the process, gotta love these unplanned spendings :)).",63
z9p1tm,travel,10,You will have have an issue leaving Netherlands as you do. not have an entry stamp in your Non EU passport.,21
z9p1tm,travel,11,"With Schengen zone as there is controlled entry ie everyone scanned in & out , it’s essential same passport is used .",22
z9p1tm,travel,12,We only had to leave once without same passport and we had a police report that the original passport that was used had gone missing.,25
z9p1tm,travel,13,Maybe if you show some documentation that passport is being kept for a visa ( not sure if they will care ) likely you could be detained for further questioning and possibly miss flight or not be allowed to exit.,40
z9p1tm,travel,14,Get to airport early. Possibly call dutch immigration and ask what if anything can be done,16
z9p1tm,travel,15,Contact your embassy for advice. Everyone here is trying to help but your embassy might even be able to give you an expedited passport or resolve the matter with SA,30
z9p1tm,travel,16,">as part of the visa application process, the South African Embassy took and kept my EU passport",17
z9p1tm,travel,17,"This is pretty average for visa processing. I've had the same done when moving to Italy, or visiting Russia for example. It has nothing to do w/ being a dual citizen. Having two passports is actually very handy in this regard so you are never without one.",47

z9p1tm,travel,23,"Very true, it can be handy - and I don't have a problem with the fact they had to keep my passport. I have a problem with them being unprofessional - they said they need 15 working days to process visa. Out of nowhere, they started making up some new rules and said it will be a month and a half instead and would not return any of my calls/emails since.",71
z9p1tm,travel,24,"Yes you can definitely do that. Problem is if you didn’t enter on it , and now need to leave & don’t have the EU one in hand or EU Id card to exit the schengen. Trust me the border guards are not happy when the entry and exit stamps don’t match up",53
z9p1tm,travel,25,"Please don't do this. Your original passport will be invalidated. You're better off going to the South African embassy, withdraw your visa application and retrieve your passport.",27
z9p1tm,travel,26,Usually we don’t plan travel using a passport that’s being sent for a visa.,14
z9p1tm,travel,27,"Has happened to me, i’m british and will almost always enter Uk on my british one , but have a second one so if one is getting a visa I use my canadian to enter , my kids will enter EU with their british / or canadian if we know we won’t have the EU one in hand",58
z9p1tm,travel,28,Good luck! Report back what happens please...,7
z9p1tm,travel,29,"That is smart, good strategy!",5
z9p1tm,travel,30,"I knew they will take my passport so I planned my travels accordingly. However, I did not anticipate the embassy would close completely for 2 weeks telling me I might get my passport back only in January, and start ignoring my emails 🙄",43

z9p1tm,travel,32,"Thank you! Will do :) Just in case I don't you can assume I was detained and imprisoned for ""suspicious activities"" 😂",22
z9p1tm,travel,33,All visa / passport related stuff has gone seriously down hill everywhere since covid ( think they are missing people / or no one wants to work ),28
z9p1tm,travel,34,This option of using the other passport will likely disappear as soon as the Etias is introduced as happened in Canada with the ETA,24

z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,1,"I am 19, since age 17 I started thinking I could be autistic. Now after two years I think it’s pretty certain that I am. People around me think so too except my parents who are against diagnoses of anything that isn’t “physical health issues”. They said I am too capable to have autism. Well, the whole thing is autism resources have saved my life. And understanding that I perhaps wasn’t weird and just a little difference made me feel a lot more confident after years of school bullying. But I don’t want an official diagnosis. I don’t want medical help because doctors are often rude or invalidating and I am sensitive. I also don’t want it because I don’t want it to bother my future jobs. I don’t know. I function decently because I have a support system that helps me a lot. But yeah.",146
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,2,Side note: you don’t have to disclose your autism to prospective employers.,12
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,3,"That being said, you’re still welcome here without a diagnosis. I just got mine a month ago, but it also took me a year before that to even decide if I wanted one. And honestly: I mainly got it to combat imposter syndrome.",43

z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,7,"They say: ""We believe that if you have carefully researched the topic and strongly resonate with the experience of the autistic community, you are probably autistic.""",26
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,8,I have never related to a post more in my entire life. It’s really nice to see the validation from the community around self diagnosis and the awkward path it takes to get there,34
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,9,"My therapist who diagnosed me advised me not to get an official diagnosis as it can limit my future, such as if I want to adopt or foster or move to another country. She said only if I feel like I need the help. It’s sad that an official diagnosis is so limiting 😞",54
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,10,"I tried to get diagnosed but my mom said there was nothing weird about me growing up at all meanwhile she is probably autistic too, but my doc was just like 🤷‍♀️ you seem normal!",35
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,11,"After the immigration to New Zealand stuff coming out I've personally decided against it. Not that that's in the plans at all, but I'm sure there are many more ableist policies we don't know about.",35
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,12,"If I need accommodations I think any company that requires proof instead of just listening to me isn't really something I want to support. Though if it's for official reasons and not a reflection of the employer themselves, I have my adhd diagnosis that I can use.",47
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,13,"Idk, just seems like the world is against us no matter what we do, we just get to pick the flavour of discrimination.",23
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,14,"This happened with a weird number of parents at the school I used to teach at. Refusing to let their kids access help and resources but only about autism and adhd. Depression and other mental health was helped with, but not these. So much ableism. You don't need an official diagnosis to say you are autistic in my opinion, if you've really looked into it and the words ""autism resources have saved my life"" sounds like you have. I have a diagnosis and I think it's gatekeeping bullshit and I was only able to access those services when telehealth exploded thanks to COVID. Since things like parents, bias, money, health insurance, lack of resources, racism, sexism, all make the system ineffective and inequitable, and traumatizing, requiring someone to go through that system to have an outsider judge their inner experience and life is morally wrong, in my opinion. Does that mean maybe sometimes people will claim they're autistic and not be? Yeah. Yes, absolutely, people will be wrong and incorrectly diagnose sometimes. I don't care, because the alternative is more autistic people suffering without resources and validation, which is what we have now and it sucks. We have rampant misdiagnosis and prejudice by out-of-date 'experts'. It's a mess.",208
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,15,"If you feel like you need what resources are being kept away from you, then you can decide if you want to wade into the morass. But if you want one for permission to recognize your identity and your needs? You don't need one, you're autistic, and you already sound like you are on the right path to understanding that and finding resources.",63
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,16,"My mom doesn’t think I’m autistic even though I am professionally diagnosed. Also, I graduated with my bachelor’s in 3 years cum laude & got my master’s degree at the age of 22 & am still autistic, so the capability thing is a load of crap :)",47
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,17,"Self-diagnosis is valid! I know it’s hard with doubting parents, but my mom knows the inner workings of my mind and body about as well as I know hers (not at all). Parents think they know more than they do about their children, so just remember that you know yourself better than your parents. My dad (who is probably also autistic) scored me a lot higher on the parent questionnaire from the doctor who assessed me than my mom did; just shows that what is visible on the outside can be interpreted differently depending who is looking.",97
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,18,"You know your inner self and your own mind better than anyone else. If you are able to access the resources you need without an official diagnosis there is no need to subject yourself to uncomfortable medical situations before you are ready or feel you need to, if that should change in the future. You are totally right that doctors can be rude and invalidating. Many do not seem to keep up with research in their field and have outdated and disproven ideas about autism and other comorbid conditions, and honestly, both general mental health *and* general women's health, so we have a *shit ton* of hurdles to overcome navigating that system a lot of times. Without supportive caretakers it is even harder.",123
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,19,You don't need an official diagnosis to discuss with any future counselors/therapists/whatever either. You also don't need an official diagnosis to be able to disclose to whoever you feel comfortable disclosing to that you are autistic. No one is going to ask for a doctor's note. ❤,47
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,20,"A lot of people with diagnosed autism ""function decently"". It can actually help you understand yourself and your needs better so that you know how to make your life easier. Not everyone has to know about it if you don't want them to, I haven't told my boss even though I've been at my workplace for 3 years. :) I'm 28 and I just got my official diagnosis in the summertime even though both my mom and I suspected I was autistic since I was like 12. I've been through the same thing with being bullied in school, and I could never understand why because I was just being myself. One of my teachers I think could kinda tell, and she was so kind to me. She was like a mother figure and she would tell me all the time, ""it's okay to be different.""",145
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,21,I'm 30 years older than you and I'm just figuring it out now. My awesome 12 year old daughter is autistic.,21
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,22,"Since her diagnosis 9 years I've been educating myself about autism and women with autism. About 3 years ago it finally started to click for me. Sooo many things began to make sense. All the things that were hard for me growing up, people thinking I was ""weird"", the social difficulties I've had (and still have), the way I was speech delayed (I thought it was because of the extreme strife going on at home).",75
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,23,Anyway. I still don't know if I will seek an official diagnosis. I hear such horror stories about practitioners who don't know shit about autism but are somehow allowed to diagnose it.,32
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,24,"Long story short, I feel you and I wish you happiness. ❤️",12
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,25,"Self diagnosis is valid. And I'm so glad you've figure it out at your age. How I wish autism was even on my radar when I was 19. Unfortunately, like most people, my understanding of autism was limited. But then again, it's only been recently that we've had more studies done and have understood it better, especially how it displays itself in women.",63
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,26,You're on the right track!,5
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,27,"it's a shame that ableism and internalised ableism prevent people from seeking a diagnosis but it is a very real problem. if you don't want a diagnosis that's okay, you're more than okay to say you suspect you're autistic and to inform whoever you want so that they can help you better",52
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,28,"a diagnosis can be very helpful but depending on where you live and your personal life it could unfortunately also negatively affect you. do not feel you have to 'decide' now. autism doesn't go away so if you find yourself wanting a diagnosis in the future that's okay too! if you find you don't need the accommodations or it will hinder you then don't feel you need to get one, after all you're allowed to say you suspect you're autistic or you have autistic traits, there's nothing wrong with that",90
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,29,"Well, you could wait a bit and decide later! I’m 2x as old as you are, and I’m just doing it now. But do consider doing it at some point so you can get support or financial benefits if you need them in the future.",45
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,30,"Self diagnosis is valid. I did get officially diagnosed, but despite having a decent career, I may need accommodations. I haven't officially disclosed my diagnosis, but if they take away our telework days I would take my diagnostic assessment from my psychologist that recommended less hours and more telework.",49
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,31,"I am looking into a lower stress field and/or a position that isn't full-time (I am fortunate that I can consider this and I know it's not possible for everyone), so I can get back from burnout and embrace my creative side. I am trying to engage with my special interest in music but I cannot work 40 hours every week and have energy to play my flute.",68
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,32,"I've strongly suspected for two and a half years that I have autism, but I don't want a formal diagnosis. The reasons are:",23
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,33,"\- I live in the US and a diagnosis is really expensive, even with health insurance",16
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,34,"\- It seems there are a lot of psychiatrists that have an outdated view of autism, especially autism in women or any traits that don't fit the Rain Man sort of stereotypes, and don't want someone uninformed invalidating my experience",40
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,35,\- My therapist is an autistic woman who specializes in autism and agrees that I'm autistic,16
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,36,"You have plenty of time to get diagnosed if you want to. Many people get diagnosed later in life, even in middle age or old age. The actor Anthony Hopkins got diagnosed in his 70s. I'd say take it slow and don't do anything you don't want to just because of societal pressure or ignorant people who look down on self diagnosis.",62
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,37,"You don’t have to get a diagnosis if you don’t want to! There’s not a massive benefit to having an autism diagnosis in the UK, because it doesn’t get you any help or medication whereas an ADHD assessment lets you get access to medication.",44
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,38,"A lot of professionals are also pretty late to the autism research party. They still think to be autistic you have to be an non verbal boy who is aggressive. You could end up getting assessed by an old school psych who might end up invalidating you and making you feel worse. Self diagnosis is valid in the autistic community, I work in mental health and we assume anyone referred/asked for an assessment has autism because it’s very hard to get an assessment on the NHS, so self diagnosis is also valid in healthcare settings too. I think as long as you know yourself and you’re happy to not have a professional confirm it for you then I think you should use the autism label if you feel it fits you!",131
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,39,My NHS psychiatrist diagnosed me but he’s not a neurodevelopmental specialist so I still need an “official assessment.” I’m not going to bother because it won’t get me anything extra. In fact during COVID our government used having a diagnosis of autism/any major disability like Down syndrome as a reason to stop disabled people getting ventilators. I’m also assuming in the US or any other insurance based country having an official diagnosis could make your insurance more expensive?,78
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,40,I feel the same way. I function with support and fortunate circumstances,12
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,41,Personally I see no need for a medical diagnosis unless it is necessary for government aid. What I DO suggest is finding a good therapist who is also ND/Autistic to help you navigate a world built for neurotypicals. My life has been made infinitely easier for mine!,47
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,42,I am self diagnosed. My father was diagnosed late in life. I started suspecting that I was when he received his diagnosis. My confirmation came when my daughter was up for an updated eval for her adhd diagnosis. The doctor removed her adhd diagnosis and diagnosed autism. When the doctor was going through her autistic traits I could’ve cried. One because I always knew she was autistic and two because all of the listed traits are traits my daughter shares with me.,82
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,43,A lot of the signs of autism are also signs of other neurological conditions. ADHD and schizophrenia as 2 examples. Find a psychologist you click with and work through things with them to get an outside opinion,37

z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,45,"If you don't want a diagnosis, that's entirely your choice.",10
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,46,"For me personally, it was a relief. But I can see where it could make things more difficult for me, too. But that's okay. I'll get to where I need to be. Whatever your choice is, it's completely valid, and you're welcome to be here as a fellow autist with or without diagnosis :)",54
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,47,"Self-diagnosis is absolutely valid & is supported. I’m formally diagnosed & I wish I never had been as I experienced severe discrimination & bullying for it, even as an adult.",30
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,48,I hope you haven’t silenced the thread cus of the comments cus I wanna say thanks. I’ve had a few resources in my notes to copy paste over the years and this is a great one to put minds at ease of those who aren’t lucky enough to have access to easy diagnosis via social healthcare/limited by worry of job prospects like OP. I think everyone here needs a lil comfort,71

z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,50,"ngl that quote made me weepy. I've been going back and forth as to whether or not its ethical and 'okay' for me to diagnose myself as autistic or even internally refer to myself as such, even though I've strongly suspected I am for almost 10 years now... And moreso the experiences of being autistic have strongly resonated with me and my experience for years. that quote provided a little bit of validation.",73
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,51,Thank you for this comment.,5
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,52,[deleted],1
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,53,"Curious- how is moving to another country limited by an official diagnosis of autism? Also, are autistic adults not allowed to adopt in the U.S.?",25
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,54,Same I noticed my parents have autistic traits as well. Like they always get the weird stares at dinner parties… and I thought I was bad,26
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,55,"I don’t think being autistic is all about being and acting weird. Our daughter is actually more normal than most children her age, I’m guessing you could say that’s strange! She can seem a bit aloof and watches them and shakes her head watching many children.",46
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,56,When I talk with my daughter she is eloquent and smart and seems very normal. I think it’s many times about autistic people understanding themselves in a world that seems very weird,32
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,57,"Wow, that got quite dark. It's not who I usually am but idk the topic just gets to me",19
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,58,"Our child is amazing, we now know she is autistic because we took an interest in finding out what autism truly was in girls and women. I was very dismissive of her initial cry’s for help because I had no idea what autism was but she did as an 11 year old girl. It’s all about the research daddy 😂 we now understand researching is part of her autism. We live in the uk and the help you can get here is non existent, in fact it’s so backwards you have to fight for any recognition. We are a year and a half into self diagnosing her autism and we have another two years waiting for an official stamp.",119
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,59,Our gp said my daughter can’t be autistic because she looked him in the eyes 😂 we spent many hours teaching her to look at peoples shoulders or just above the head,32
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,60,"The main thing preventing me is my fear of having a traumatic experience with the doctor doing my assessment. I have had very traumatic medical situations before. I will try to work that idea in my mind and see when I feel ready. Because I do want to get an assessment done, I am just scared. Thank you. <3",59
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,61,I 100% agree self diagnosis is valid and it’s nice to hear a medical professional agreeing!,16
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,62,An autism diagnosis via NHS in U.K. got me the following:,11
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,63,"Access to disability support services which is a lovely lady that came and essentially fixed my life (I had debt and calls/letters that needing chasing, she sorted it all),",29
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,64,"Access to PiP which gives me an extra £500 per month none means tested to make life a little easier,",20
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,65,"Access to long term disability benefits if I find myself out of work (don’t need it rn but a lot of ASD end up without work),",26
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,66,"Free and easy access to an NHS dentist (there’s a community care dentist in every major city that you have to be disabled to access),",25
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,67,"Easier access to therapies tailored to ASD and also medications (I’m given argument free diazepam to use when I see fit whereas that’s usually difficult to obtain, I use it sparingly for high anxiety situ),",35
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,68,Priority register with energy companies so if the power goes out I get it back quickly/if works are planned I get advanced notice etc,24
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,69,"You may not need any of that but I think it’s really important that people know that that’s available to them. I honestly need some of that but I think my son is getting the real benefit. He’s 14, diagnosed at 10 and wow, I got him an EHCP (education healthcare plan) with the local council so he gets:",59
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,70,"A placement at a local ASD school with 12 kids per class and 4 teachers (wtf right?!),",17
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,71,"No bullying ever cus his schoolmates are like him and omg did I mention the 12 kids per class?! That place is Hogwarts,",23
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,72,"Access to PiP also which is around £450 per month rn and will increase and be paid to him direct when he turns 16 regardless of income,",27
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,73,"Advanced support on the transition from school to college including an offered placement at an ASD college which has lines of ASD friendly businesses connected waiting to employ them,",29
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,74,"Extensive support when he chooses to join university (the list I saw was crazy, from extra financial aid, free computers and extra time for tests),",25
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,75,Lastly he’ll have the supports I have but getting all this support early really gives him a leg up,19
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,76,"My psychotherapist who I've been with for a few years now alerted me to being autistic recently, and from there everything has fallen into place and it's been a journey of self acceptance to say the least.",37
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,77,"I wanted to get an NHS assessment but the wait is over 18 months and going private costs 2K, but I feel like I am less valid in people's eyes if I don't have an official diagnosis (also imposter syndrome), so I am probably going to fork out the money. It sucks.",52
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,78,"No I didn't silence anything. I routinely paste this link because reddit population is so changing, new people are here every hour, I suspect.",24
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,79,I think it is really important that a major USA uni is taking this stance.,15
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,80,So?,1
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,81,"There was a thread this week about how an autism diagnosis can limit immigration - a lot of ""developed"" countries consider autism a reason to reject your application. I was specifically interested in Australia - apparently they rejected a kid bc of their autism, but gave the rest of the kid's family entry, and it was only bc of international outrage that the kid was accepted. So yeah, any musings about official diagnosis have officially gone out the window for me :')",82
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,82,"There was a post about this a couple of days ago, specifically about New Zealand. I think it was here but I'm not 100% sure. Sorry, I don't feel like fishing for it right now, but yeah, sadly not BS. Certain countries, certain states have these restrictions.",47
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,83,"Yeah weird isn't quite the right word but she told me doctor there was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary in any way about me. Like she couldn't come up with anything at all that might interest him. Which doesn't make sense because she told me plenty of stories of my behavior as a child that seemed out of the ordinary to me. Her favorite thing to describe me as was ""an old soul"" because of how unchildlike I acted, and she did not mention that at all to the doctor.",91
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,84,No of course I’m glad you commented because I didn’t know that was all available! Like at all??? I’m actually in shock!!,22
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,85,I’m well aware that getting diagnosed as early as possible for children is so important as that obviously unlocks support in schools etc so if OP wasn’t already an adult I’d have 100% suggested going for an assessment.,38
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,86,"But in the NHS trust I work for there doesn’t seem to be anything available to those who have level one/mild severity autism. As the NHS diagnosed me it’s just not from the “official” autism psychiatrist, it is on my notes and things so I thought I was basically treated as if I have an official diagnosis as my GP, LMHT, crisis team etc all recognises it. As far as I know professionally and what I have been offered there’s nothing in terms of massive support network or therapy offered which is tailored to ASD. Any clients, both on the wards and in the community with ASD have only been offered CBT which isn’t great for ND people. I applied for PIP and was awarded enhanced rates for ASD despite not having an “official” diagnosis so I have that but other than that I haven’t seen any benefits. My LMHT told me the neurodevelopmental special services in my city offer support once diagnosed but when I spoke to them they told me they do the assessment and discharge you without further support. Unless you have ADHD and they will keep you on through medication titration.",195
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,87,The dentist thing has especially blown my mind! I’m terrified of the dentist and have only had one procedure without full on sedation. I asked both my LMHT and my dentist if there is a service for people with autism and sensory issues to get sedation done quicker/free and I was told there’s nothing! I even posted in the DWP Reddit asking if PIP allows you access to dental surgeries and everyone said not really no.,76
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,88,I’m actually shocked! In work we help people apply for PIP and such and that’s all we suggest other than a referral to adult social care. I guess it really is an NHS/social care lottery.,35
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,89,I’m glad you have got so much out of the diagnosis and it’s allowed you to set up things for your son. I genuinely didn’t think it did much because where I am it really doesn’t seem to!,38
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,90,ETA: I’ve been prescribed diazepam for stressful life events a few times but that was all pre diagnosis. As far as I’m aware and from what my psych said there’s no meds specifically for autism and wouldn’t prescribe anything for my intense anxiety 😟,44
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,91,"I so get you, I do really struggle with imposter syndrome too. I have to regularly look at my clinic letter from my psychology where it says I have “probable autism of mild severity” under my working diagnosis. I’ve just put the deposit down for a private ADHD assessment because although my psychiatrist thinks I have it, as they’re not working for the neurodevelopmental service and they’re controlled drugs he can’t prescribe the medication for me and I didn’t want to wait. So deffo understand your pain. Just remember you’re valid even if one day they assess you and for some reason you don’t get the diagnosis!",107
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,92,Still apply for PIP though with autism as a diagnosis! I was awarded PIP for my autism with just that letter and you could put your psychotherapist down and they can contact them for clarification.,35
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,93,[deleted],1
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,94,"I wouldn’t worry to much about the doctors, from my experience they don’t seem to be to smart. My ex was a gp and a surgeon and she told me never trust the word of a doctor. I think that speaks volumes 😂",43
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,95,"I’m so glad you help people apply for PiP. That thing is life changing and so damn hard to get without a professional to help and validate your claim. I hope you know how appreciated that is, I was nervous about being weird when my nurse hooked me up but I wanted to cry and hug her!",57
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,96,I am wondering if it’s an area/city thing as the area I live in is impoverished but it is an “autism friendly town” in Lancashire,25
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,97,"I’m amazed you can get PiP that’s awesome!! I honestly thought you had to have a concrete diagnosis cus they had me show them our papers when I applied, thank you for that I know a couple of ppl irl that that’s going to help!",45
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,98,The service that diagnosed me (LANC Ltd) basically gave me my papers and said off you pop! Super helpful…,19
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,99,I’ve found a lot of places offered support/concessions without an official diagnosis cus it’s not like they’re going to ask to see your papers so I always tell autistic peeps I know to just say they are if self diagnosed as they’ll still have access. A lot won’t due to imposter syndrome which is awful.,55
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,100,"If you have a community dental practice near you please access it! The one I attend is amazing, they’re trained to deal specifically with disabled people, I see a lot of severe MS sufferers there. I’ve been baby talked through streaming tears and it’s the only way I can get work done now. I wouldn’t have known it existed without my support worker (she’s part of Focus-Care a GP support service aimed at combining medical care with social care, essentially a nurse that’s trained to do a social workers job).",90
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,101,I get a semi regular prescription of Diazepam but I only claim maybe 10 pills a year? There’s no pills for us but I find SSRI helpful and the pills I’m given for epilepsy are used as mood stabilisers off label and help massively with my anxiety. I was on propranolol for my anxiety initially and it was a wonder drug but my blood pressure is naturally low so it was no good long term.,75

z9pmca,MuslimLounge,8,Makeup where non-mahram are seeing you would be tabarruj.

When I can’t pace for long periods of time I start to get emotional, angry, irrational etc and the same goes for if I can’t find the right",75
z9qnvv,MaladaptiveDreaming,2,"song to pace to. It went from just thinking up random stuff to music in my free time to using every morning, every passing period in school and every night to do this. And I’m stupid for thinking it wouldn’t have any consequences. Not only have I been pacing everyday for two years but I’ve also had my volume at full for almost every time. I’ve been starting to notice the insides of my ears hurting out of nowhere, I need to ask friends to repeat themselves at least 10 times, sometimes there’s ringing, stuff like that. I’ve been trying my best to pace to music at a lower volume but it’s so hard when you’ve been unconsciously been doing this for years. I’m scared.

I haven't lost more hearing, but I started to hear a ringing in my ear that I think is tinnitus. It has been very hard for me, but every time I try to resist and turn down the volume of the music, but sometimes I put the music at maximus volume again, but now it doesn't happen that much. I have the same fear you have because I'm also a teenager and I love music and I can't live without it. I don't know what advice I could give you, but I sometimes try to hide my headphones to avoid picking them up, but I know it's really hard.

z9qput,TheOCS,12,">one's I like are usually $100-$130, which ends up being a very pricey oz",14
z9qput,TheOCS,13,~~$100-$130 CAD is a pricy ounce nowadays?~~,7

z9qput,TheOCS,18,Its tough to find decent ones but here are my picks that aren't dry dehydrated 2hr cure time dust:,19
z9qput,TheOCS,19,\-Berry Smasher - Muskoka Grown,5
z9qput,TheOCS,20,\-Dosi-GMO-si #6 and #13,4
z9qput,TheOCS,21,Try to find a local growers who care about there product and get it from them.,16
z9qput,TheOCS,22,Yes. I'm not interested in buying 28 grams of crap just because it's fairly priced for what it is. Where are the premium ounces?,24
z9qput,TheOCS,23,PSF Sugar Cookies has been on rebuy for the last few months. I haven't gotten tired of it yet.,19
z9qput,TheOCS,24,everything's just relabelled weed that couldn't be sold from seasons past :p,12
z9qput,TheOCS,25,"What BBoB strains did you try that were dry? I've only had the Pink Cookies and ICC so far, and the ICC was pretty good, but the Pink Cookies was the farthest thing I've ever gotten from dry. Shit was almost too wet lmao, but was still good for the price for me.",53
z9qput,TheOCS,26,[deleted],1
z9qput,TheOCS,27,[deleted],1
z9qput,TheOCS,28,Could look at going to the medical side in addition to ocs. You’ll get a bit more variety and it’s a bit cheaper for high end stuff.,27
z9qput,TheOCS,29,"Pure SunFarms berry cream puff!!!!! amazed me so much. I also seriously love the good supply pineapple express, we sell it for $90 and i'm personally really liking it",29
z9qput,TheOCS,30,Pure sun farms sugar cookies and Area 51 are both good oz’s,12
z9qput,TheOCS,31,Have you tried smoking less.,5
z9qput,TheOCS,32,If you don't mind pre ground. Weed me grind 20%+ is not to bad or the 30%+ 14g in a glass jar.,22

z9qput,TheOCS,34,"Vertical Cold Creek Kush is solid stuff..comes in a 7 gram package for around $45…nice terps, smells great, white ash.",20
z9qput,TheOCS,35,"Same, I also blow thru a zip in about 5-7 days, having homegrow sprinkled in there helps a lot.",19
z9qput,TheOCS,36,"Agreed, if people keep buying this ocs thinks we like it, time to boycott! where’s the bc indoor ozs?!? Favouring Ontario for what to show doesn’t grow good weed, psf I can grow better weed!",35
z9qput,TheOCS,37,My go to Oz picks are..,6
z9qput,TheOCS,38,"Sativa: Color's ""Pedros Sweet Sativa"" ($165/ounce) or MTL ""Sage N Sour"" (Around $7/gram)",13
z9qput,TheOCS,39,"Indica: Redecan's ""Wappa"" ($130/ounce)",4
z9qput,TheOCS,40,"If anyone has a better option, let me know :)",10
z9qput,TheOCS,41,"Freedom cannabis, the Canna Cabana by me dropped the price of it to 120 recently. Always decent numbers, never been upset with the bag appeal either. I’ve seen as high as 3.2% terps with the top terp being over 1% a couple times on their birthday cake.",47
z9qput,TheOCS,42,If your that sick of the OZ options you might need to find a store with good 14g options that sell close to cost and eat the travel to balance it out. Or just spend the extra $50 for the week for the 2 14g just to shake things up.,50
z9qput,TheOCS,43,The Bbob options that are newer weren’t dry,8
z9qput,TheOCS,44,I’ve noticed for awhile but never thought much because I was always smoking hard to get a true sent comparedto someone who is not smoking. I recently stopped smoking and everytime someone walks by smoking makes me not wanting go back ever. Doesn’t smell like the weed I remember before it went legal doesn’t smell right smells off. And everywhere I go everyone smoking has that same scent of burnt rubber. I looked it up and they that smell is neem oil that is used to kill mites when there is an infestation. I’ve been smoking for 15 years and never smelled this before a lot of the weed downs not smoke heavy very light smoke when you take a draw also it hard to find real quality a lot of garbage over rated stuff coming from the government I’ve tried all the company’s all the oz all the eights all the quarters.I remember an old man telling me to watch out with the weed once the government takes over there never in the business of bettering people just destroying them. I remember seeing a documentary where they took bunch different weed to the laboratory to check for thc and cbd percentage. They said that cbd is naturally occuring in marijuana to counter balanxce the schizophrenia that weed causes the test came back with 0% cbd on all the buds. Meaning that it was purposely taken out… WATCH OUT FOR THE BULLSHIT EVERYTHING IS FAKE NOW A DAYS,248
z9qput,TheOCS,45,"Lol ya I instantly had like 5 messages from people offering illegal product. Like, no thanks, I'd rather not smoke your cat hair kush.",24
z9qput,TheOCS,46,&#x200B;,1
z9qput,TheOCS,47,I have not given Puresun a shot in a while. I know they upped their game for Cookies so maybe I'll give it a shot. Also didn't realize Fraser Valley was from them! Thanks for the info :),38
z9qput,TheOCS,48,"When I was a kid, we took what the bikers gave us and we liked it, godammit.",17
z9qput,TheOCS,49,This! You got what the dude had or nothing.,9
z9qput,TheOCS,50,"Same. I usually got quarters at a time, but there were rarely strain options lol. It was guaranteed to be something different the next time though.",26
z9qput,TheOCS,51,D Burger was good but out of stock. Think it’s out of stock until next year. Grown outdoor in greenhouse with assisted lighting.,23
z9qput,TheOCS,52,"Anyone denying this is a salty, salty hater, who owns shares in miracle grow.",14
z9qput,TheOCS,53,It's the best under 100 bag on the market.,9
z9qput,TheOCS,54,"Quality is a stretch. It's decent. It's a passable ounce, reasonable quality at its price.",15
z9qput,TheOCS,55,That's the half oz price.,5
z9qput,TheOCS,56,Wish I could. I unfortunately live in a shoebox. Tried growing outdoor a couple of times and it was mostly a bust.,22
z9qput,TheOCS,57,Do you have runners all over and the best pricing?,10
z9qput,TheOCS,58,Berry Smasher! I have not tried that one! I'm headed out to grab it now. Thank you for the suggestion!,20
z9qput,TheOCS,59,"Edit: the only dispensary near me that had it was closed when I got there so I hit up a Value Buds (gross, I know) and grabbed two half oz’s of Red Fatso from Doja. Definitely spent more than I wanted, but I’m feelin’ preeetttty glonky right now.",48
z9qput,TheOCS,60,Bought the Berry Smasher 120 plus tax and found it alot better than the cheaper 100 dollar ounces Ive been smoking.,21
z9qput,TheOCS,61,Can confirm Berry Smasher is pretty good. A little larfy (well more “airy”) but very good stuff for the price. I too got sick of BBOB Pink Kush (and I loved it at first - the strain quickly loses intensity for me as I work through the bag).,48
z9qput,TheOCS,62,This.,1
z9qput,TheOCS,63,Low price does not make weed better by default,9
z9qput,TheOCS,64,"Or wrongly labelled genetics, hybrids being sold as indicas/sativas, wrongly labelled %'s, no terp %'s, irradiated weed, etc.",18
z9qput,TheOCS,65,And people somehow tout the legal market as being infinitely safer and more quality than the BM 😂,18
z9qput,TheOCS,66,"I’ve had really nice, moist, chunky batches of pink cookies and I’ve had gross, dry, kernels of pink cookies. I’ve tried most of their strains, but my point is that the consistency is way off.",35
z9qput,TheOCS,67,pink cookies from bbob def overly moist most of the time,11
z9qput,TheOCS,68,I work in the industry. Weed everywhere. But I am mostly a medical user for chronic pain. My prescription is for 5g/day. I personally hate vaping. Makes me cough way more than smoking.,33
z9qput,TheOCS,69,"Blows me away as well. I vape a half ounce a month and if I'm awake, I'm high.",18
z9qput,TheOCS,70,"Pink Cookies, but to be honest I'm off the BBOB wagon. The last couple of bags I got were VERY harsh. The quality just isn't there.",26
z9qput,TheOCS,71,"For that you gotta hope you're not the 20% if Canadians that don't have a family doctor, and even if you have a doctor you gotta hope they'll hook you up with a card and not put you in SSRIs for some off label reason",45
z9qput,TheOCS,72,Yeah but then I find it painful to walk and I’d rather not get addicted to opioids.,17

z9qput,TheOCS,81,Oof. Black market weed just isn't as appealing anymore to me.,11
z9qput,TheOCS,82,"Yeaa! PSF definitely been stepping their game up. Only bag I'd suggest against is their pink kush. if your a fan of PK, theirs ain't great atm.",27

z9qput,TheOCS,85,"And out of Fraser Valley, their D.Burger was good, nothing too great. And their MAC 1 I absolutely love, great hybrid high for me 👍",25
z9qput,TheOCS,86,Lol I understand your preference for legal but Chad on Telegram probably has way better shit than all the shit you mentioned and almost every legal Oz lol. Pure sun farms is still quite bad,35
z9qput,TheOCS,87,I'm in the same boat. Same selection every week. Usually end up with BBOB. I first went to good supply but they had a good run and have had some bad batches lately. I've gone 3 straight on fraser valley donny b. I'd recommend that one for sure. My next step is to try psf. Most likely sugar cookies but maybe bubble mints. I'm a big fan of island cherry by SEV7N. Apparently redecan has stepped up their game. I grabbed tweeds kush mints and they've stepped up as well. Theres also a new company (or one I havent heard of) called well made with 2 new ozs. Stay away from riff and caesar salad lol. Whatever you grab if its something new please review it,126
z9qput,TheOCS,88,Sticks and seeds for a 4 finger Oz $60. Or go to the store for a tube of airplane glue and a paper bag 15c.,25
z9qput,TheOCS,89,It was this Quarter is 50.,6
z9qput,TheOCS,90,This one is 55.,4
z9qput,TheOCS,91,Those are your choices.,4
z9qput,TheOCS,92,The Fraser Valley stuff looks like complete shit.,8
z9qput,TheOCS,93,Definitely not 'quality'.,3
z9qput,TheOCS,94,*Anybody denying this has shares in PSF*,7
z9qput,TheOCS,95,Sucks :( Saves me so much money now I smoke about the same as you.,15
z9qput,TheOCS,96,Can tell you the last two years have been shit for outdoor growers.,13
z9qput,TheOCS,97,How is it?? How does it compare to Pink Cookies?,10
z9qput,TheOCS,98,"True, but the average (good/fire) ounce shouldn’t be $180+. If you’re talking about quads/quads+ then I understand. But, the majority of the bud at 110-120 could be lowered. It’s because of the major overhead the companies have (employees, buildings, taxes, licenses, etc). They’re for profit, so if they can squeeze $10 out of you they will.",56
z9qput,TheOCS,99,"there's pros and cons ex. safety in not having to get into some sketch person's car to buy... but recent fumbles in results(THc%/CBD%, terps) from lab shopping to mislabelling def doesn't help with building trust in the legal side of things ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)",42
z9qput,TheOCS,100,You think your BM delivery service is putting accurate THC content on their listings? Or terp %,17

z9qput,TheOCS,110,"Testing of illegal stuff would say your wrong. The THC levels are roughly the same but they are growing with excessive fertilizer and don’t flush right. Aka the stuff burns like a sparkler from too much fertilizer. Then there is a high chance of mold. I don’t trust chad ever, never have.",52
z9qput,TheOCS,111,"I’m sure it’s fresher, but it’s also full of shit. I like knowing what I’m smoking.",16
z9qput,TheOCS,112,"For the legal price range of their oz’s, quality is there. Big difference from going $77/oz to 140/oz.",18
z9qput,TheOCS,113,Then why can I not keep it in stock? What are you buying if you have exactly 95 bucks pre tax? How long have you been working full time in the cannabis industry?,33
z9qput,TheOCS,114,Just edited my comment. Didn’t end up grabbing it. Got Red Fatso from Doja,14
z9qput,TheOCS,115,"No one buying from the BM is still getting into sketchy cars, most buy online and I've never seen a delivery service that makes you get in the car, if anything they tell you to just stand at the window (and those are just as sketchy as a dispo that delivers)",51
z9qput,TheOCS,116,They don't even bother because no one expects them to. If the government's not even getting it right how do you except the little guy to?,26
z9qput,TheOCS,117,"Not rough, harsh.",3
z9qput,TheOCS,118,I'll let myself out.,4
z9qput,TheOCS,119,"This is good to know as I will be picking up a oz, was torn between pink cookies and mac 1 and went pink cookies. But haven’t liked it as much as of recent, seems Mac 1 is cheaper aswell!",40
z9qput,TheOCS,120,"Yes. Do this. The more people with ""medical issues"" getting scripts from Mendo the better.",15
z9qput,TheOCS,121,It means eventually it'll get cracked down on. It's a rec dispensary masquerading as a medical dispo. It's skirting a bunch of rules in QC and out of province.,29
z9qput,TheOCS,122,It's getting to do things and has access to products the rest of the rec market doesn't. Like shipping product to customers.,22
z9qput,TheOCS,123,It's bunk.,2
z9qput,TheOCS,124,The clinic I was talking to said they needed confirmation of a diagnosis from a doctor before they could hook me up with a card.,25
z9qput,TheOCS,125,I'll look into mendo's site though cause my doctor's a bitch and a half to get ahold of,18
z9qput,TheOCS,126,From what I've seen looking into it you either need a doctor to email the file with your diagnosis to the clinic that gives out the cards or you need to get the file printed out so you can give it to the clinic,44
z9qput,TheOCS,127,If you've got a family doctor though I'm pretty sure it shows up on your file,16

z9qput,TheOCS,136,"Thc levels mean very little to the quality of the smoke. It’s a small part of the big picture. And yea Chads vary in quality greatly haha. There are many illegal operations that put as much care and attention to detail into their bud as high end legal brands do. And then of course there’s absolute garbage chads lol. But I’d rather order from a high end chad then smoke PSF any day. I understand some people are willing to compromise on quality and value by settling for the low-end legal offerings because it feels safer to them, but to a lot of seasoned smokers that stuff just doesn’t cut it.",111
z9qput,TheOCS,137,Then why you buying weed at all? The only way you're gonna know what's in it is if you're growing it yourself,22
z9qput,TheOCS,138,Price doesn't define quality.,4

z9qput,TheOCS,144,I'm in a small town. Our most popular delivery service is a staggeringly large operation.,15

z9qput,TheOCS,152,"TGOD is Organic but is not craft grown and is generally pretty poor quality. Organic alone means nothing. For example Sugarbud (RIP), Distinkt, and JOI are all craft growers with much much better cannabis than tgod even though they're not technically grown ""organically"".",43

z9qput,TheOCS,160,If they decided that LPs couldn't sell products that didn't have accurate cannabinoid/terp listings and created more standardized government run testing centers everything would change for the better in a heartbeat.,31
z9qput,TheOCS,161,Government in the end is to blame. They could make stricter rules/regulations for LP’s/labs for testing. Can also have more random inspections. The government made the rules.,27

z9qput,TheOCS,164,Facts! Lunawest being a prime example,6
z9qput,TheOCS,165,So you think all the best producers exist in the legal market and that pure sun farms is better than grey market stuff? I’m going to answer your stupid question with a slightly less stupid question.,36
z9qput,TheOCS,166,The OCS included testing over sight in their Cannabis Act review recommendations. Here's hoping.,14
z9qput,TheOCS,167,Then we'll see a flurry of products ended and a drop in over all THC percentages lol,17
z9qput,TheOCS,168,TGOD irradiates. Distinkt does not. The latter is craft.,9
z9qput,TheOCS,169,"🤦🏼‍♂️ PSF is mid, and they're priced that way. I'd rather have a wide range of CHOICE, with no gatekeeping of *connections* with *the best shit* by shitty people.",29

z9qput,TheOCS,177,Lol yes psf is less than mid and priced like actually decent grey market stuff. People are growing better weed than legal stuff and don’t have the ability to scale or gain legality for a variety of reasons. I understand your preference for legal but I’m not sure why you can’t understand why somebody doesn’t want to pay $100 an oz for crummy weed,64
z9qput,TheOCS,178,Probably not available in ON. Craft grower/producer in Calgary.,9
z9qput,TheOCS,179,Edit: also available through Mendo medical,6
z9qput,TheOCS,180,"Because quality is perceived by the buyer. If i buy a bag of weed, I don't give a shit what *your* opinion on it is. If i enjoy it, then who the fuck cares.",34

z9qput,TheOCS,183,"Thanks, I haven't ordered from mendo in a while. I'll look them up",13
z9qput,TheOCS,184,Lol I’ve already stated I respect your reasoning for preferring legal. Enjoy what you enjoy. But also just respect that people did fine before it was legal and we didn’t die smoking the illegal stuff 🤣 I see the value in knowing your stuff is clean/safe and that’s fine.

z9qput,TheOCS,187,I can only speak of my own experiences.,8
z9qput,TheOCS,188,"This whole thread started with you saying ""Chad"" could get better weed then any legal option. All's I'm saying is if their weed is good, clean and they're not fucking criminals, they'd go legit.",34

z9qput,TheOCS,190,"I will certainly say I wouldn't trust Chad and his buddy's grow abilities over any decent, reputable LP's. 1000%",19
z9qput,TheOCS,191,Not any legal option. But any affordable Oz option yea. I’ll still buy some cheap legal ounces just for convenience and consistency. It is nice to just go to the store and know exactly what I’m getting. But I do feel the legal market is just sort of weak in the budget oz sector. And did you smoke weed pre-legalization? Every experienced grower was a “fuckin criminal” at some point haha. There is good clean weed out there.,78
z9qput,TheOCS,192,"You’re putting “decent, reputable, LP’s” and Pure Sunfarms in the same category? Shows how little you know… Bought their stuff 3 times and was moldy twice, it was comparable to a $10 oz I bought in Mexico",37

z9r0t0,gradadmissions,1,"The Ph.D. is on Human-Robot collaboration at **Swinburne University of Technology** in Melbourne, Australia. Scholarship of $34k/annum with tuition fee sponsorship. My potential supervisor looks interested in hiring me, and I am also interested in this problem, however, I am concerned about the university's reputation and ranking. What are your thoughts on it? I will be an international student there.",60
z9r0t0,gradadmissions,2,"I can't speak to your discipline, but I can say that in the Australian job market you're not really going to be competing against Ivy League graduates often because the ivy league doesn't exist here. I think in general we care a lot less about University rankings. I'm not saying it doesn't matter at all, just that it doesn't matter that much. I think in general both in and out of Australia, people are more interested in the work you've done. If you have good work and good publications nobody will carr about your institution, and after your first job they'll care even less. Also Swinburne isn't bad. And Melbourne is a great city. And those funded positions are competitive so it's an achievement in and of itself to get that. If you like the course, the professor, and the city, I really really wouldn't stress about the prestige.",149

z9r5s0,Veterans,1,"My wife is retiring in 5 months and we are buying a home the bank wants a letter from the VA stating her expected retirement amount with her name on a VA letter head. Has anyone gone through this? Also, any advice on how to get the letter we have been calling the VA but no one is picking up.",60
z9r5s0,Veterans,2,Get a different bank if they don't understand where military retirement pay comes from.,14
z9r5s0,Veterans,3,"Further, DFAS doesn't even know what her retired pay will be yet because those calculations are done after separation. you can kind of do the math yourself and ballpark it based off her draft DD-214 but you won't the final answer until she either gets her first ERAS or the payment hits the bank. That is the ay it worked when I retired. I want to say DFAS has up to 60 days to start paying you. The final month's AD pay is held pending the final audit from DFAS, mine was released 45 days after my retirement date. In my case I got my retirement check the following month but I know guys who did not.",117
z9r5s0,Veterans,4,"Might be some confusion on this. I believe the letter they are asking for is to see if you need to pay the funding fee or not. My bank didn't ask for this when I was retiring, with a pending disability claim, and I had to pay the funding fee. A VSO might be able to help get this letter. It should only state that you have a pending claim, and are expected to get 10% or more. This only applies if you are closing after your date of separation, not if you are closing while on active duty, because your date of disability will be after your separation date.",110
z9r5s0,Veterans,5,"If they are asking for this to get a loan approval they are wrong, this is only used for closing costs(funding fee).",22

z9r5s0,Veterans,8,Get a different bank that actually knows what they are doing.,11
z9r5s0,Veterans,9,The bank wouldn't use my future (retiring in 1 month) retirement pay as it had not happened yet. We had to find another way. Total shit,26
z9r5s0,Veterans,10,Why does the bank need to know she is retiring? Not what you asked but have you considered calling a mortgage broker (one who works with many banks) for a better rate/deal?,32
z9r5s0,Veterans,11,The bank wants proof of income. Pretty common issue with military retiring.,12
z9r5s0,Veterans,12,Yeah I can understand that but what if the member is not gonna retire? Like say they got 19 years and they wanna stay until 26-30 years.,27
z9r5s0,Veterans,13,Not to mention its not a secret how military retirement is calculated.,12
z9r5s0,Veterans,14,"I guess I'm not surprised, banks have definitely learned from the housing crisis 15 years ago.",16
z9r5s0,Veterans,15,"If they aren’t going to retire, the LES would reflect a future date.",13

z9rse5,diabetes,0,From 8.4 to 5.8 A1c,5
z9rse5,diabetes,1,I was diagnosed 2 months with A1c 8.4 now now is down to 5.8 . Without any medication I just did keto . Big achievement. There is a hope.,29
z9rse5,diabetes,2,Pretty good progress!,3
z9rse5,diabetes,3,"As I'll note to others, it's possible for some people to achieve positive results with lifestyle changes, but not everyone can do this. Additionally, make sure your changes are sustainable. Diabetes is a marathon that never ends, and burnout is real, which can lead to regression. If you feel you can keep up the intensity of keto, then by all means, go for it because it appears to be working for you.",72
z9rse5,diabetes,4,Good luck!,2
z9rse5,diabetes,5,Very nice! And very quick! We went low carb over a year ago and were heavier keto with our diet the first 2 or 3 months - it was working great too! But then we saw one of Dr. Richard K. Bernstein's videos where he does finger wagging saying to make sure a person gets enough protein! So we listened and upped our protein - but will still use a lot of keto recipes. Here in this more recent video he does some more finger-wagging about protein at 18:30 of '[19 Facts your Doctor May Not Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHLFP71Oi3Y&t=679s)'. With his nearly unbeatable experience we figured we ought to listen. We mention Dr. Bernstein along with many others in this [message board thread](https://ihatedialysis.com/forum/index.php?topic=35473.0).,121
z9rse5,diabetes,6,Looks like you caught it early! Always best when that happens. Congrats!,12
z9rse5,diabetes,7,Nice Work!!,2
z9rse5,diabetes,8,Great job! You’re going down the right path!🥳,8
z9rse5,diabetes,9,It is doable I went from 9 down to 5.4 within a year after my diagnosis and kept it around that for a while before becoming pregnant. I was able to maintain those readings through keto and weight loss but it’s a lot to keep up with on a long term aspect. after delivery I may consider at least meal time insulin because I will say pregnancy has allowed me some freedom within my diet that I missed,78
z9rse5,diabetes,10,You did well on your self discipline. And it really takes self discipline to stop T2 from becoming progressive. You are already a step ahead of most. Keep Going !,30
z9rse5,diabetes,11,&#x200B;,1
z9rse5,diabetes,12,"High insulin during a lifetime is one of the biggest causes of insulin resistance. Continuing to shoot insulin makes type 2 a progressive disease. Using an insulin pusher (a drug that makes the pancreas produce more insulin) does the same thing. Just stop eating carbohydrates and watch your BG fall. I can say this from experience. I was diagnosed 20 years ago and took the advice of physicians with whom I worked. They all told be the same thing, ""Stop eating carbohydrates. But, I am not your physician and did not tell you this"". 20 years later I am still on an extremely low carb diet. I eat about 20 grams per day. I started this diet journey by stopping all carbohydrates. I went through withdrawal for 3 days. It felt awful. After 3 days it was like a miracle. I felt better than I had in so many years. It was like I had 20 years taken off my age. I felt so good that it was a long time before I would even eat anything green. You need to drink 100 oz of water per day.",188
z9rse5,diabetes,13,I highly recommend Metformin to help with your journey. I prefer the ER version. It is cheap and has proven itself over the decades. Metformin does not allow you to go ahead and eat carby stuff that is bad for you. It just helps perhaps with most people by knocking off 10 points from your BG meter.,57
z9rse5,diabetes,14,"Use your meter often! believe your meter. If you want to know how a food affects your BG, you need to eat a portion that you would normally eat and then measure every 15 minutes for 2 to 3 hours. You need to detect the spike. Spikes count. Any reading over 140 begins irreversible cellular damage. Taking your BG 2 or 3 hours after you eat does not tell you what you need to know in order to stay healthy and expect the same lifespan as a non-diabetic.",88
z9rse5,diabetes,15,"Continuing to eat carbohydrates and covering it with insulin or a pusher, will eventually cause serious complications and effect your quality of life in a seriously negative way.",28
z9rse5,diabetes,16,Taking this advice will demand serious change. Most of us hate change. I hate change.,15

unknown,unknown,2,Just remember your a1c is not a grade. It’s meant to inform you if what you’re doing is working. A small increase probably isn’t anything to worry about. Subsequent results showing an up trend or larger increases tell you something isn’t working and it’s time for adjustments.,47

z9s7fj,Sparkdriver,0,New Driver Question,3
z9s7fj,Sparkdriver,1,"I am fairly new to spark and have a question for those who have been doing this for a while... Orders with multiple deliveries, what is your process? I drive a Toyota Prius. I recently had two orders and the loader asked which order I wanted in my trunk, one was a small order the other a medium. When I told him both, he questioned me as to how I would know which was for each order. Told him the smaller order was to go in my vmcatering bag and the bigger one out if the bag. (I was planning on packing the other order in bigger bags to make delivery easier, just wasn't trying to hold up the loader). But, it got me thinking if I was to take one of the orders that have 9-12 deliveries, even though most were one or two items, the sticker would be on that single bag, but there were some that obviously would be multiple bags. I feel slowing the loader down while I pack in seperate ""delivery"" bags is not the right thing to do... Do you all use those multiple compartment trunk dividers? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",199
z9s7fj,Sparkdriver,2,Very simple. With grocery orders one in the trunk and one in the back seat as per TOS you agreed too.,21
z9s7fj,Sparkdriver,3,"If they are dotcom orders, each one will have its own sticker. Food and other general merchandise are usually in bags with one sticker per order going with you. It's much easier to keep them separated (one in the truck and one inside the car) just to be on the safe side.",52
z9s7fj,Sparkdriver,4,"They can refuse to dispenser if you can't keep grocery orders separate. Plenty of drivers with Prius's dont have problems with one in trunk, one in back seat.",28
z9s7fj,Sparkdriver,5,The dot.coms are completely different things.,6
z9s7fj,Sparkdriver,6,"Please go through the ""how to sparkle 101"" shit if you haven't yet.",13
unknown,unknown,0,"The 9-12 orders are not grocery pickups. Its merchandise thats packed like amazon packages. Curbside grocery picks are always only 1 or 2 customers. Thats why when loading grocery pickuups, the bigger on goes in the trunk and smaller one in the back seat. The loaders are trained to keep the orders are separate as possible.",56
unknown,unknown,1,> 9-12 deliveries,3
unknown,unknown,2,"They each have their own sticker. I put all the small ones in my front passenger seat so I can grab as I go, multiple bag orders and large items I put either on the backseat or trunk.",38
unknown,unknown,3,For the grocery orders I have stuff in the trunk I don’t wanna mess with I put the small one passenger and the other in the backseat. Try to separate it that makes it easier.,35
unknown,unknown,4,"I drive a Prius too, and always have my seat down to make a bigger loading area. I always put the smaller order into large insulated bags and the bigger order into ikea bags. None of the loaders have had an issue with this, so far. I can see they mark one order for the trunk and one for back seat on there end even though I don’t technically have a back seat.",73
unknown,unknown,5,"For the dotcom orders, if I have more than six or eight orders I actually alphabetize them in my trunk/cargo area after the loader has finished. Makes it super easy to grab the one I want and if somebody has multiple packages they will be together so I won't have to hunt for them.",54
unknown,unknown,6,"As far as the crap in your backseat, you need to take it out when you're sparking. The loaders have good reason to not want to put other people's groceries in with your stuff, because of hygiene concerns and also because they don't want it getting lost in the shuffle. All my personal stuff goes in the front passenger seat.",60
unknown,unknown,7,"Thank you. My back seat I had a carseat and all my ""delivery""/reusable grocery bags that I normally keep in my trunk but wanted out of the way for the orders. I did that because I had read on another post how a loader complained about stuff being the a drivers trunk, even though it was nothing more than like a crate of necessities in a car- jumper cables, etc. So because of that, I didn't think putting an order in the back seat would be ""approved"" with my personal items there. But I appreciate your info, thank you. It helps.",101
unknown,unknown,8,"Ok, That makes sense, I have seen some white with yellow packaging that resembled the Amazon gray plastic bags. I am assuming that is what you mean as packed like Amazon. Then each on of those packages has its own sticker even if you have multiple ones going to the same address? This makes more sense in my head now. I had been scared of accepting any and worrying how it would fit in the car, had one that looked like the description was a 32"" TV as well.",89
unknown,unknown,9,"Thank you for the advice, love the alphabetical idea.",9
unknown,unknown,10,"My personal stuff, other than my grandson's carseat, is reusable insulated bags that I use for not only my own grocery shopping when I am out as I live 30-40 mins from Walmart, but I also use them to help carry deliveries in with, reduces the hand fatigue and chances of the thin crap walmart bags (our area does not have the thicker plastic bag like Target has) breaking while trying to deliver. I have 9 or 10, they normally fit behind my seat on the floor. Other than that, I have two blankets that sit in my grandson's seat when I am delivering, vs in the trunk for emergencies and a rain jacket, cause you never know.",118
unknown,unknown,11,"Yes, the white and yellow poly mailers packages are what we call DotCom orders. Your basically and amazon drivers delivering packages and yes some customers may have like 2 or more packages.

First two weeks I had a fever for a few days and now I've caught the stomach bug. I havent stopped throwing up for two days and could barely see straight.

Is it worth waiting for my immune system to toughen up? I'm thinking I should just quit at this point, I can't keep getting sick and I can't keep calling out and leaving people hanging.",90
z9tvve,ECEProfessionals,3,"So, I think it's a misconception/myth that your ""immune system gets stronger"" the more you work with children. While it's true that your body will develop antibodies whenever it's exposed to a virus (like the cold or flu), there are hundreds upon hundreds of viruses that effect humans, that the likelihood of becoming immune to all of them is low. And everyone's immune response is going to be different -- if you're immune compromised, being exposed to more viruses can actually be harmful.",83
z9tvve,ECEProfessionals,4,"To answer your question -- I don't know. But from my experience, you don't stop getting sick. Some viruses may be less intense than others, but after 13+ years, I'm still getting sick. The only thing that has prevented illness is wearing a mask for me.

In november 2021 Rachel sent a picture to Kyle of me slapping her ass. I would like to preference this by saying i am gay and she told me to do it as it would be funny. After this we got dressed and went to a party not checking our phones. At the end of the night we both checked our phones to see Kyle had text both of us giving out and being quite agressive, Rachel crying and me, being drunk, sent him a voice message explaining i don’t understand why he is so angry at us seeing as i’m gay and have been friends with Rachel for 4 years and have always done stupid stuff like this and have never had any relationship (even before coming out). Kyle finally calmed down a few weeks later and it was all ok again.",175
z9uu7z,AITAH,3,"This past March me, Kyle and Rachel went to a bar with a few of our friends for drinks. The night went well and no drama happened the whole night. As i was leaving i hugged Rachel goodbye and left with Kyle and a few of our mutual friends to go home. Kyle never said anything to me and it all seemed ok. the next morning i woke up to being given out to by both Kyle And Rachel for trying to get in between them. i obviously confused said i didn’t no what they ment yet they both blocked me and he was threatening to beat me up",109
z9uu7z,AITAH,4,me and Rachel stopped talking for a few months and i was devestated because i lost my best friend.,19
z9uu7z,AITAH,5,2 months ago Kyle and Rachel broke up. She rang me crying over it and i cheered her up. Later that day while hanging out with friends i saw that Rachel had added me on snapchat and we started talking as we used to.,44
z9uu7z,AITAH,6,4 days later Rachel and Kyle got back together but Rachel promised she would tell Kyle to be nice to me and we will continue to be friends.,28
z9uu7z,AITAH,7,"last week i saw that Rachel had blocked me on snapchat for no apparent reason. i confronted her about it and she said her phone must have glitched. she added me back but about 2 hours later she had blocked me again. The next day at school i asked her again if it was Kyles fault i was blocked again and she immediately got defensive, she said the reason she blocked me is because i was annoying and a bitch. this set me off and i blew up at her for still",92
z9uu7z,AITAH,8,"being with Kyle and being to pussy to stand up for herself. i told everyone about how toxic she had been and then leaked all our chats of her being rude and a video of her and Kyle making out. Everyone laughed about it and everyone is saying i’m in the right except my group, they are saying i’m being an assshole and have been standoffish with me since.",69
z9uu7z,AITAH,9,so AITA,2
z9uu7z,AITAH,10,"putting people's private messages out whew is never good, and the video of them.kisaing is just weird to post. it sounds like she's got herself an abusive, controlling boyfriend. pity her an move on, don't stoop to being an asshole yourself.",41
z9uu7z,AITAH,11,What does “being given out” mean?,6
z9uu7z,AITAH,12,I think you over reacted.,5
z9uw0d,BorderlinePDisorder,0,How do you take care of yourself after hard therapy sessions?,11
z9uw0d,BorderlinePDisorder,1,"I had an emotionally draining therapy session today and at the end, my therapist said “take good care of yourself today” but I don’t necessarily know how to. How do you do it or what do you like to do?",40
z9uw0d,BorderlinePDisorder,2,"I try to do something that calms me, like petting my cat. Going outside helps, so I take my dog for a walk. I sometimes will do a small ""busy"" project, that occupies my mind, like cleaning out a drawer.",40
z9uw0d,BorderlinePDisorder,3,"I try to have a quiet rest of the day. Take a nap, sit in the sunshine, paint my nails etc. Just things that make me feel safe and peaceful.",30
z9uw0d,BorderlinePDisorder,4,"I typically go out in nature to ground, breath work, paint, nap, bath, watch something silly.....generally anything that's healthy, safe, and makes me feel like I'm cared for.",28
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,0,Is it normal to not have a goal weight?,9
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,1,"Just as the title reads... Answering questions in my psych packet and one question asked my goal weight. The more I've thought about it, I don't have one. I've never looked at getting this surgery to reach a goal weight, I have a ton of NSVs I can't wait to check off, but reaching a certain weight isn't one of them. Is this normal? The more I think about it, the more it's bothering me. Everyone on here seems so excited to reach onederland, should I be looking forward to that? If I don't have a goal weight and honestly tell that to my psychologist, will that be a reason to not approve me or something? Should I put a number and just keep my NSV list to myself?",129
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,2,"I just want to feel better about myself. Put on jeans that fit (everywhere)... Go bike riding with my son. Overall, I want to teach him better food and exercise habits. I know these are good things, but it's okay for these to be my goals, right? Not, just a number...?",51
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,3,I sure hope it’s normal because I definitely don’t have a number in mind.,14
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,4,"My thought is that I’m going to do what I can to take care of myself as best I can. I’m going to lose weight in that process, but I have no idea how much or when that weight will come off. In fact, it’s impossible for any of us to know.",52
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,5,I think what they’re looking for on some form is that your number is realistic. Do you weigh 293 pounds and want to get down to 95? That’s probably not realistic or healthy.,33
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,6,"My goal weight is fitting on a rollercoaster. I don’t have a weight in mind, but my ideal size is a size 12/14. But I’d be happy at a 16 as well. I have large hips that I want to keep.",41
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,7,I only have a number goal because there is a weight limit to sky diving,15
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,8,"I'm kind of in the same boat. If I can get under 300, I'll be thrilled. But a number isn't really what I'm shooting for. I want to be able to fly on a plane without a seatbelt extender. I want to be able to shop for clothes somewhere other than the Big & Tall stores. I want to be able to climb more than two flights of stairs without needing to stop for breath. I guess the goal weight is just more of a concrete victory to strive for, but all the other little things are going to mean far more to me as they happen.",107
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,9,"I never had a goal weight either and really believe that is the healthier approach. I have a lot of things I want to do to enjoy the full capabilities of my body that only weightloss will provide, but saying I want to weigh 120 and be a size 4 is not an approach that I am willing to take.",60
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,10,I think you should have a preliminary goal (like losing 70% of excess weight) but I don’t think anyone can have a final goal because most of us have no idea what it would be because we’ve been so far away for most or all of our adult lives. My preliminary goal is to lose the excess then I’ll reassess. I want to get to a lifestyle that has balance and isn’t all or nothing.,75
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,11,I hope it's normal because I don't either lol.,9
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,12,"I was 200 lbs at 10 years old, so I don't know what adult me is supposed to weigh or what is realistic.",23
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,13,"I agree with everyone else, I think it's more about having a healthy goal.",14
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,14,I loved going based on NSV as opposed to an overall end goal. I also don’t have a number and my surgeon didn’t either. He cares about my overall health. I am almost 2 years post op and at my 18 month Check up he said to match the BMI range I’d have to lose 20 more pounds but he doesn’t care about that. He is so happy with my progress and now wants me focusing on building muscle for better overall health. So I have no actual stated goal weight from my surgeon and I have never really cared about one. I started this journey at 314+ pounds and am hovering around 175 right now so I’m just pleased overall! I love not having a goal weight.,128
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,15,"My surgeon asked me what my goal weight was, on my 1 year anniversary. I straight up told him I don't want to be defined by a number. I can walk without a cane, do stuff without being out of breath. That is my goal.",45
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,16,Plus I really hate buying clothes lol.,7
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,17,Eh I don’t have a hard number. I had a loose one where I hit milestones with each birth/pregnancy of my kids. So far I’m down to birth of 2nd kid. Still need to work down to 1st kid. If I get that far maybe weight at enlistment?,48
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,18,"The only numerical goal I have is to get into the 100's again, but I don't have a goal weight. I think wanting to be and live healthy, and feel better, is a good enough goal.",36
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,19,"I don't have a weight goal. A few years ago I managed to lose 50 lbs. Played the best golf of my life that summer, then gained it back.",29
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,20,"I want to be able to walk 18 with my son with no foot, knee or back pain and maybe even be able to beat him on occasion.",28
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,21,I think you have a very healthy perspective.,8
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,22,"My consultant asked me if I had any more questions and then said oh you should loose about 85kg, most people ask that question, I didn't know hiw much that was ( from UK and use stones and lbs) but smiled and said great",44
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,23,I never wrote down or spoke a goal weight because I mentally did not want to put pressure on myself or end up feeling failure if I did not get there. I know there is a weight above an ideal weight that I would be comfortable and healthier at. Would I like to get to my ideal weight sure but I focused more on following a healthier eating and lifestyle and let the results be what they are. I had also read that on average people lose a percentage of their “excess” weight. Something like 75 percent. But anyway the inverse of that is that people still keep a percentage of their excess weight so I didn’t want to create an unrealistic scenario that would trigger me to feel as though I failed,133
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,24,Also don't have one but a ton of different goals.,10
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,25,I don’t have an end goal… I have “little” goals along the way… I’m down 160 lbs and about 10 lbs away from actually being what my driver’s license says I weight… that was a goal for me. I also want to weigh less than my husband (about 50 lbs away right now). But my next dr visit I plan on asking what a realistic goal weight for me will be because I know I’m gonna have a lot of excess skin weight.,83
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,26,"I don’t have a goal weight. My goals are to bring my blood sugar levels down, I’m a type 2 diabetic, and just overall have a more healthy body.",29
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,27,"My take on that question (goal weight) is that they want to be sure your aim isn’t unreasonable. Imagine putting down a number so low that, for an person who’s never dealt with weight issues, would be difficult to achieve. I think it’s fair to say “I’d expect to feel comfortable in my body at X weight, but what my real goal is to ride a bike without my joints hurting, be able to play with my kids without being too out of breadth, etc.” As everyone alludes to - it’s a major mental challenge, so you’re head has to be in a reasonable space.",105
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,28,"I don't have a goal weight and never have. Told my surgeon, my nutritionist, my psychologist, everyone, and they were all fine with it.",24
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,29,"It's pretty simple, find the weight that puts you in the healthy BMI range ..there's the goal.",17
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,30,For sure normal! I didn’t have one at first I just wanted to feel better and fit in clothes I liked. Then I got under 200 and was like hey 170 sounds like a good place cause it’s a “normal” BMI weight for my height. Now I’m under 170 and I’m like hey 150 would be cool! Who knows if I’ll have a new one at 150 when I get there. Just going with the flow and what feels good for my body.,83
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,31,"I think it can also be discouraging in the beginning to have a “goal” cause it seems so far away, hundreds of pounds away and before surgery that made me feel like I’ll never get there so why even try.",40
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,32,"I don’t have a goal weight either, but if I can get down close to 200lbs I’ll be happy. My “healthy” weight is supposed to be 134 and I don’t think that’s realistic for me, so my dad and I agree that we hope I can get down to 200 at least. Doctor never mentioned a goal weight for me though",61
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,33,"I never really had a goal weight, but a goal range. I am now in that range and just work maintaining that 3-5 pound range.",25
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,34,So if they need a definitive answer look up the weight for the ideal bike u want to ride or the weight of a typical person who wears whatever size jeans u want to get into?,36
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,35,"Yeah the scale number is not everything. BMI is also not really a good indicator, especially if you are also building muscle. I don’t have a weight goal, but more of a weight “range” because I know that I’m building muscle in the process and muscle weighs more than fat. Someone could look really fit and have muscle on them and the bmi calculator will tell them that they’re overweight lol. Body fat percentage is probably a better measure…",79
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,36,"My goal weight is to get down to wearing 2XL shirts again, don't know what number that'll be for me.",20
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,37,"I don’t have a goal weight, either. I think I’ll know it when I get there n",17
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,38,"Echoing other responses. I just kind of guessed based on what I think I may have weighed at a reasonable place in history. I emphasized to my surgeon I was more interested in certain activities, not a weight. I care more about body composition than scale. Guess those were acceptable answers! Haha",52
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,39,Good luck! :),3
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,40,"Is it normal… absolutely. Everyone should have a goal but it’s not necessary. Your doctor/surgen/ primary provider can set one for you but it’s up to you to decide whether it works for you or you go beyond that. Either way, trust the process and you will be successful",49
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,41,I just said 154 because that’s the weight that put me at “normal” bmi. I just want to be healthy and able to do stuff with my family. 50 pounds down at 216 and I’m getting there.,37
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,42,My goal weight is seeing my collarbones :),8
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,43,"i have a goal. at the start of the program i was 296. lb my heaviest ever. i gained more weight after my pregnancy but my pregnancy i didnt get the natural labor i wanted. i had to be induced. induction was horrible. had to get epidural just to rest. (labor took 2 days) and my daughter got stuck twice. pushing took 3 hours but i got her out. either way i started having hypertension just at 5 months of pregnancy and had alot of swelling(preclamcia runs in my family). my ashma got worse. back got worse and my knee injuries got worse. after having my daughter i gained more weight and tipped at 296. it was a wake up call for me. when i saw the doctor i was 286. goal weight for surgery was 271. made it. had surgery oct. 19 2022. now im 232. what pushed me to have this surgery was that i wanted to be a better me, for myself, my husband, and my daughter. i want to be at a healthy bmi so i can live longer since i already have health issues, i also want to have a healthy pregnancy when it comes time for the 2nd baby. :) i have multiple goals, first goal is to get under 200lb. i would be thrilled. 2nd goal is healthy bmi which is 150-160lb. if you dont have a goal in mind thats fine, just strive to be a better and healthier you :)",249
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,44,I didn't have a goal weight.,6
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,45,"Honestly, I thought this surgery would be just another thing that didn't work for me, so even if I put in the work (and I did do the work) - I just didn't want to be let down when the weight didn't drop like everything else I had tried.",49
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,46,I've been pleasantly surprise and have lost over 100 lbs 9 months out.,13
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,47,I sure hope it’s normal because I definitely don’t have a number in mind.,14
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,48,"My thought is that I’m going to do what I can to take care of myself as best I can. I’m going to lose weight in that process, but I have no idea how much or when that weight will come off. In fact, it’s impossible for any of us to know.",52
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,49,I think what they’re looking for on some form is that your number is realistic. Do you weigh 293 pounds and want to get down to 95? That’s probably not realistic or healthy.,33
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,50,Thank you! That definitely makes sense now!,7
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,51,"I love this! I haven't even thought about it, but riding a roller coaster again sounds like an amazing goal. I'm definitely adding that to my list now!

z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,61,I'm in this boat. Overweight my entire life. No specific goal in my head. It just seems unrealistic,18
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,62,Thank you. It's hard to imagine reaching other goals I've set for myself.,13

z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,65,"That's a great way to look at it. I'd love to be what I was before I had my son... you know, back when I thought I was sooo fat. 🙄",31
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,66,"I like how you said that, just a general goal number range. I think I might put something like that! I'm scouring over what is considered a healthy 5 based on my height. Tbh, they so sound so little. I can't imagine ever being that tiny!",46

z9vu5x,Harley,1,nan,1
z9vu5x,Harley,2,Interests rates are high. 5% is considered a good rate. Check around at banks and credit unions before going in to a dealer.,23
z9vu5x,Harley,3,Go to a credit union and ask for an auto loan. Then look around for a bike private sale. You’ll save money overall and some might still have the factory warranty. And you’ll know your interest rate while you’re shopping around.,41

But when I was looking this up, I can’t seem to find anyone saying that any certain one will reliably distribute on time. I get things like “tunecore typically releases in 3-5 days” etc.",107
z9vugm,UnitedMasters,3,"I need one with better customer service than UnitedMasters, and comes through for me on release day reliably!! I’m also quite broke so it can’t be expensive really. Like no more than $100/yr. Help! Am I looking for something that doesn’t exist? If so, how do you promote an upcoming single when you don’t know the date it will for sure be available? Thank you! Any advice would be greatly appreciated❤️",71
z9w4em,Skincare_Addiction,0,Maturation Arrest Acne in pregnancy,5
z9w4em,Skincare_Addiction,1,I have had maturation arrest acne for about 15 years now. I was seeing progress at the beginning of the year using CeraVe foaming cleanser and PM lotion day and night and using Glycolic Acid 7% every other night. I've had to stop using glycolic acid because of pregnancy and now my skin is as bad as ever. Any suggestions for getting maturation arrest under control with pregnancy safe products?,70
z9w4em,Skincare_Addiction,2,"Hi there! I’m so sorry to hear this is happening. Maturation arrest is such an annoyance. I had it start after I got clear of cystic acne during my pregnancy, when I was post-partum it developed and I’ve been trying to deal with it since. Face reality products helped me a lot with both, if you have access to an esthetician I would recommend seeing one for it as it is incredibly stubborn. I actually think my esthetician incorrectly increased the intensity of my products, when often maturation can be the result of the wrong products.",96
z9w4em,Skincare_Addiction,3,"I use an app called “acne safe” to check the ingredients of all my products, so for your current routine I would check them out to make sure there is nothing comedogenic. During your pregnancy incorporating some mandelic acid or benzoyl peroxide might help if it is severe. At this point I only use a salicylic toner and occasional retinol or benzoyl peroxide, I found that with the right hydrating products and exfoliating a few times a week my skin responded better than when using actives several times a day.",90
z9w4em,Skincare_Addiction,4,Paula’s choice also has some good products that shouldn’t make the maturation worse. Good luck and congratulations on your pregnancy 🤎,21
z9w6l8,classicalmusic,0,Recommendations based on Handels Messiah,5
z9w6l8,classicalmusic,1,I’ve recently delved into the world of classical music as my in laws play it a lot to my new born baby. His overwhelming favourite seems to be Handels Messiah. So I’m hoping there are similar pieces I can explore as I’d like to listen to some other similar pieces.,50
z9w6l8,classicalmusic,2,Specifically I’m listening to this album on Spotify:,8
unknown,unknown,0,Listen to Israel in Egypt! It’s just as good!,9
unknown,unknown,1,"--Try some of Handel's other oratorios, like *Israel in Egypt,* *Solomon,* *Saul,* and *Theodora*",14
unknown,unknown,2,--Bach's *Mass in B Minor* and *Magnificat*,7
unknown,unknown,3,--Haydn's *The Creation*,3
unknown,unknown,4,Monteverdi Vespers of 1610,4
unknown,unknown,5,Bach Christmas Oratorio (especially the 1st cantata),7
unknown,unknown,6,"Probably most energetic baroque music like Vivaldi concertos (including but definitely not limited to the 4 Seasons), Telemann overtures, pretty much anything by Jean Baptiste Lully",26
unknown,unknown,7,Other Handel: try the coronation anthems. Maybe take a video of baby’s face the first time they hear Zadok the Priest (it builds then it explodes).,26
unknown,unknown,8,Suggestion that’s a little outside the box: Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Most of the humor holds up.,17
unknown,unknown,9,Edit to add: a musical advent calendar from a classical radio station. You can try something new every day.,19
unknown,unknown,0,Others have given great suggestions. I'll just add that Handel's Judas Maccabeus has some very catchy movements:,17
unknown,unknown,1,Just in Act 1:,4
unknown,unknown,2,"* Pious orgies,",3
unknown,unknown,3,"* I feel, I feel the deity within",8
unknown,unknown,4,"* Arm, arm, ye brave",5
unknown,unknown,5,* Call forth thy powers,5
unknown,unknown,6,"* Come, ever-smiling liberty",4
unknown,unknown,7,And of course:,3
unknown,unknown,8,"* Judea, happy land!",4
unknown,unknown,9,* Sound an alarm,4
unknown,unknown,10,"* Father of Heav'n! From Thy eternal throne,",8
unknown,unknown,11,"* See, the conqu'ring hero comes!",6
unknown,unknown,12,* SIng unto God,4
unknown,unknown,13,* Wavy corn,3
unknown,unknown,14,"* Rejoice, O Judah",4
unknown,unknown,15,and the Hallelujah! Amen! finale that rivals the Amen chorus at the end of Messiah.,15
unknown,unknown,16,"Saul is also wonderful, but darker.",6
unknown,unknown,17,"Serse of course contains Ombra Mai Fu, which is just so beautiful.",12
unknown,unknown,18,Waft her gently from Jephtha and Eternal Source of Light Divine are so transcendently lovely.,15
unknown,unknown,19,"I don't know similar music but speaking of the Handel's Messiah, I recommend conductor Gardiner's version.",16
unknown,unknown,20,Water and fireworks maybe,4
unknown,unknown,0,This IS the best one. Objectivel,6
unknown,unknown,1,Edit: I just realized you want recommendations of similar pieces not of good versions messias.,15
unknown,unknown,2,Listen to Bachs Matthew passion. Greatest work of music of all. Hand down,13
unknown,unknown,0,• Handel's other oratorios and operas. I like Rodelinda. Of course in the operas it's more solo arias and the occasional duet or trio. Not so many choirs as in the oratorios.,32
unknown,unknown,1,"• If you like the choirs in Handels Messiah, then you definitely should listen to **Bach**s cantatas and oratorios. I like BWV 198, BWV 34, BWV 11 and many, many others, and would recommend those. Specifically for great choirs I'd mention the opening movements of BWV 248, BWV 72, BWV 63, BWV 5 and BWV 109. Also the final movement of BWV 191 and [the duet in BWV 134](https://open.spotify.com/track/12h5B5BucNevnyGEB9Pkse?si=d60ed7d81e7d418a).",69
unknown,unknown,2,"• If you like the fact that it's not only very good, but at the same time very accessible, listen to Mozart's requiem if you haven't already. And to a lesser extent Pergolesi's Stabat Mater.",35
unknown,unknown,3,"• Other composers that you might want to try: Vivaldi, Charpentier, J.C. Bach, F.X. Richter, Purcell, Rameau, Cavalli, Caldara, Telemann, Erlebach, Monteverdi, J.-H. Fiocco (search for lamentations and petits motets), Hasse and many others",34
unknown,unknown,4,"• Thomas Linley the younger's opening movement to The tempest, which isn't on spotify. There's [a recording on the Hyperion label](https://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dw.asp?dc=W7669_66767), and [a decent video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uk9sNQAt4s).",27
unknown,unknown,5,"• I also really like W.F. Bach's cantata ""Lasset uns ablegen die Werke der Finsternis""",15
unknown,unknown,6,"Edit: forgot to mention Homilius, whose solo arias sometimes have a Handel-like quality.",13
unknown,unknown,7,Gratius agimus tibi!,3
unknown,unknown,8,Handel's setting of *Dixit Dominus* very much sounds like a proto-Messiah. Lots of musical ideas that are going to make much more developed appearances in *Messiah* in their early stages.,30
unknown,unknown,9,Never mind the why and wherefore!,6
unknown,unknown,10,"I second this. Period recordings of baroque and classical period pieces have a light bright feel, very characteristic of the piece.",21
unknown,unknown,11,I have Trevor Pinnock's version.,5
unknown,unknown,12,Thanks! I will check it out!,6
unknown,unknown,13,"Thanks, will have a listen 👍",6
unknown,unknown,14,"Oh damn, the Sixteen is my go to recording of Messiah!",11
unknown,unknown,15,"But, the Matthias Passion is great, but, the Messe in h-moll is the best composition ever. 😄",17
unknown,unknown,16,No BWV 140?,3
unknown,unknown,17,My pleasure! :),3
unknown,unknown,18,"A lot of people think h-moll is #1. My argument for why st Matthew is higher is that the libretto is the greatest story ever told and the most, well, passionate - the passion of Christ. And its longer and it has a larger variety in its music. There are chorales, arias, recitativos, and combinations of the three. The mass only has arias and chorales.",65
unknown,unknown,19,"It's not in my top 10 of favorite Bach cantatas, but the real reason I didn't mention it is I didn't think it would be useful to give a list of *35 cantatas you absolutely should listen to*. On the other hand you're right that BWV 140 maybe has more of a Messiah-vibe than some of the ones I did list.",61
unknown,unknown,20,"Oh I take your point, the Passion tells an amazing story (even if you're not a believer, it's a story of betrayal, suffering, sacrifice, and redemption), the same story the B-minor mass tells (""Gloria in excelsis Deo"", ""Et resurrexit"", etc.), but in a much more visceral way.",47
unknown,unknown,21,"But... there's an amazing variety of styles in the B-minor, and Gratias agimus tibi....",14
unknown,unknown,22,😄,1
unknown,unknown,23,I'm going to listen to what you've listed!,8
unknown,unknown,24,I suppose my main point is that the mass is only a musical work whereas the passion is a musical work with elements of other arts in it like theater and even painting if you include the music's ability to paint a picture with your imagination,46
unknown,unknown,25,"Thanks for your Handel suggestions! I do really love his music, but I don't know all of it.",18
unknown,unknown,26,"Yes, absolutely, you're right!",4
unknown,unknown,27,I have only begun my journey!,6
unknown,unknown,28,"(I've seen, live, what, Messiah\*, Saul, Judas Maccabeus\*, Giulio Cesare\*, Rinaldo, Theodora, Balshazzar, Radamisto, Acis and Galatea, Aci Galatea e Polifemo, La resurrezione, and few others. \* denotes multiple different performances.)",31
z9wic8,IBD,0,How can I talk about my chronic disease without feeling ashamed?,11
z9wic8,IBD,1,Any thoughts on what should i say in a note about my chronic disease to give it to my principal? I tried to explain to my principal that i can’t go to classes he say he’ll try to explain it to other teachers so I can be able to skip all classes.. but rn i need to find a right way to put it in a paper.. and a good words,71

z9wic8,IBD,4,I suffer from diarrhea I be going 7 times before getting out of my house and 7-8 times at college. Without eating any food! Also I’m gassy all the time whether I stoped eating or not. That’s why I can’t attend classes. cuz even if I went to the bathroom the min I get out I feel like I wanna shit myself again. So I go back and this feeling won’t go! And being gassy it’s the worse in high school students and even teachers used to complain about the smell! So I can’t do this anymore.. that’s why I need to take online classes and I need to make them understand and make them accept it!,117
z9wic8,IBD,5,Also Sometimes I get constipated which make it worse more gassy and stomach ache…,14
z9wic8,IBD,6,But yk I can’t say these words knowing all of the teachers will know this.. but at the same time I need to make them understand that I literally can’t go to classes.. can you give me some words or a way to say it better?,46
z9wic8,IBD,7,I’d really appreciate it!! It can change my whole life…,10
z9wic8,IBD,8,*btw I gave him a doctor note before about that I can’t attend to class but didn’t explain my condition in it.. he want all my doctors reviews so he can show it to other teachers so they accept..,39
z9wic8,IBD,9,get a 504/accommodation plan,4

z9wrhp,zoloft,0,Anyone currently on zoloft that also is a highly sensitive person?,11
z9wrhp,zoloft,1,"Earlier this year I discovered that all the things I thought made me so different the way I experience the world was just because I'm an HSP (about 20% of the population is!). But now that I was able to identify why I experienced the world a certain way, I realized most of my anxiety, social anxiety, and depression came from this. Just wondering if anyone who's an HSP tried this drug and has has success in being able to manage their anxiety. I'm on day 2, and so far so good, no changes but I didn't expect any just yet.",101
z9wrhp,zoloft,2,"Yes, high chance I am and the meds blunt my emotions. It makes it a lot easier to handle life in general. You can send me a message if u wanna chat.",32
z9wrhp,zoloft,3,"Yes, I'm an HSP on zoloft, and will be undertaking an assessment for autism soon. I'm also a mental health professional. I found that zoloft balances my over reactivity to stimuli and just kinda... chills me out more. I also feel much more positive mood and greater motivation. Hope you have a good experience on it OP. Expect some weirdness in the first few weeks with side effects, but most should diminish with time. About 2 months in is when I really started to feel better 😄",87
z9wrhp,zoloft,4,Been on for a few months now. It’s awesome! I’d say I still retain the traits of HSP but I’m not feeling so anxious and depressed. I feel normal! It’s amazing I never knew I was such a neurotic wreck before until I got better 😂,46
z9wrhp,zoloft,5,"Omg I can’t wait to feel normal and not like I’m WIRED every second of every day. Now that I know where my anxiety/depression is stemming from, somehow I’m even more self aware and it’s not great 😅 I’m so glad you’re having this experience",45
z9wrhp,zoloft,6,All these comments make me so hopeful and persistent to stick out any side effects that will come my way. Thanks for your comment! 😊,25
z9wrhp,zoloft,7,"HSP here! I've been on zoloft for about 6 months and it's been great. I still feel like myself, just without the anxiety.",23
z9wrhp,zoloft,8,Yes I am and I’m in the 90th percentile for neuroticism,11
z9wrhp,zoloft,9,HSP here. It took a while to find the right dosage (made my way to 100 from 25 over six months) but was worth the trial and error. I am much happier and do not dwell on others peoples opinions and actions like I used to. I have more energy and mental space for my family because of it. Good luck!,61
z9wrhp,zoloft,10,I'm commenting now so i can leave a more detailed comment later!!,12
z9wrhp,zoloft,11,I am and I’ve been on Zoloft for 4 years. I did a lot of therapy while on Zoloft and recently started lowering my dose. I’m realizing Zoloft gave me the chance to learn tools to deal with how I feel my way through the world. Zoloft simply lowered the sound to all my feelings so I could process and learn tools. As I turn the volume back up I realize it is no where near as bad. Good luck op.,81
z9wrhp,zoloft,12,"Yes! I discovered I was HSP after starting therapy and starting taking Zoloft. Helped me find balance to move forward. For your info, the first month on Zoloft was really hard for me; hang in there 🙂",37
z9wrhp,zoloft,13,"Started couple a days ago on 25mg, main issue is excessive worrying (as in: out of control) and anxiety; I must say the first pill I took I felt immediately (within 10 minutes) working in on my nervous system. Right now I feel a little dizzy and out of this world, but I get a lot of support from my wife and colleagues at work, as I need to talk about my feelings all the time! I gave it a lot of consideration but at some point I had to draw the line and accept the fact that doing nothing wouldn't help me either.",104
z9wrhp,zoloft,14,I’m glad you found your balance! Thanks for letting me know 😊,12
z9wrhp,zoloft,15,wat like emotionally or like to stuff,7
z9wrhp,zoloft,16,That sounds amazing and gives me hope! Thanks so much for answering,12
z9wrhp,zoloft,17,Yeah such a relief for me as well!!,8
z9wrhp,zoloft,18,Thanks for the reply! I hope I have a good experience on it too :),15
z9wrhp,zoloft,19,I can relate except for the motivation part. It drains my motivation 🥲,13
z9wrhp,zoloft,20,Wow this sounds ideal,4
z9wrhp,zoloft,21,"Thanks so much for your reply! That’s what I’m hoping for, to kind of turn down the volume while I learn how to properly deal with everything I process. Everytime I make some progress, overwhelming emotions take over. So I needed that calm down",44
z9wrhp,zoloft,22,Thanks for telling me! I’m really glad to know it helps :),12
z9wrhp,zoloft,23,Are you sleeping better on zoloft? Perhaps your nervous system is recovering from some burnout and once you've had a big rest your motivation might increase 🤞,27
z9x0sv,forhonor,0,I haven't played in years. How does Lawbringer play atm?,10
z9x0sv,forhonor,1,"When I used to play his kit was very narrow, but I am a huge history nerd which drew me to the game in the first place, and LB had the most ""realistic"" knightly moves and theme. Warden's kit revolved around his shoulder charge move and it looks silly to me.",51
z9x0sv,forhonor,2,"Even though LB moves were limited, he had a high HP pool, so to get better at him you had to be creative with baiting trades and mixups, and I grew to love that playstyle.",35
z9x0sv,forhonor,3,"Does lawbringer still play like this? If he was changed, what's his current playstyle?",14
z9x0sv,forhonor,4,Are there any other characters that play similarly?,8
z9x0sv,forhonor,5,"He’s still the old defensive character. His shove is very safe to land, meaning it can’t be punished.",18
z9x0sv,forhonor,6,"Hell, All of Lawbringers moves can’t be punished.",8
z9x0sv,forhonor,7,"You try to dodge his heavy to guardbreak him, he’ll use his second chain heavy/light.",15
z9x0sv,forhonor,8,"Even if you try to dodge his unblockable heavy and try to guardbreak him, he’ll follow that up with a shove.",21
z9x0sv,forhonor,9,Lawbringer is a mad defensive character…and his mighty catchphrase(Ad Mortem Inimicus) is still uttered gloriously on dominion.,17
z9x0sv,forhonor,10,He's literally the same. No good openers. A decent dodge bash that recovers fast enough to allow him to punish some slow dodge attacks. Lower damage all around but his light parry still deals a lot compared to other heroes. He's pretty much the only turtle left in the game.,50
z9x0sv,forhonor,11,Depending on when you last played he's either completely different or still the same. Right now he isn't very viable competitively because his offense is rather lacking as he has a hard time initiating offense and getting to his finishers. However his parry punishes are still really good. But this means that you are basically forced to play defensively as a lot of other characters have gotten better offense over time. But his core playstyle design has stayed the same. You'll just have to adjust to everything else that's been changed.,91
z9x0sv,forhonor,12,"LB hasn't changed much at all in recent years. The only change I can remember since his ancient rework is that he lost the hyperarmor on his shove. What has changed, though, is the game itself. Moves are faster, with much more of a focus given to making reads as opposed to just reacting to what an enemy is going to do. It may take some getting used to, but by and large, FH these days is much more offensive, whereas lawbringer back in the day was designed to be defensive, so he's a fairly weak character in the current meta.",101
z9x0sv,forhonor,13,"That said, most of the balance in this game is pretty decent, so you can certainly use him to good effect. It's just, that thing you mentioned about having to bait people into things and punish them for it? That's now a much larger part of the game, rather than just a LB thing. You'll be doing that no matter who you play.",63
z9x0sv,forhonor,14,Sounds like the game is in a good spot balance wise. Thanks for the comments. What's a personal recommendation for a character besides LB that I might like?,28

z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,0,48 Hours for a Career Decision,6
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,1,"I currently work in a proprietary Software Support role for a large company, I am due a raise and review in January and have been given responsibility over some automation options and analysis of our chat bot. I have been given an offer that I must respond to in 48 hours for a Help Desk position at a large government contractor. The new role Would shift to general help desk, offer a 2.5k raise, maintain my current benefits, support a secret clearance (biggest deal for me) but I would also could very likely end up at 3rd shift or other similarly odd hours. My questions are as follows:",108
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,2,1. Is the new experience worth the switch?,8
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,3,2. Would my current job be better for a future in development?,12
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,4,3. How valuable is experience with government work at a secret clearance level?,13
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,5,4. Should I speak to my current manager about the possible raise and review?,14
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,6,5. Should I worry about failing to receive the clearance and therefore having left my job for no reason?,19
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,7,6.Is there any more information I could gather that could help my decision?,13
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,8,Thank you to anyone who reads and replies. I’m at a loss.,12
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,9,"To me it sounds like the job you have is better than the one you're going for (you can probably get a 2.5k raise in the review), but there is value in having a security clearance. You can always take the new job, work for a short period then apply to better positions such as something in development if you like. Having the clearance makes finding better and higher paying jobs easy, and if you can find one that will sponsor upgrading your secret to a TS that's even better (although doing this will most likely eliminate almost any fully remote jobs if that's important to you).",107
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,10,"As for failing to receive the clearance, I wouldn't worry unless you know there's something that would eliminate you. Things like undisclosed drug use coming to light, criminal background history, and being in serious debt. By that I mean having bills 120+ days behind and being in collections. If you have a clean background then there's no reason why it wouldn't go through.",63

z9xqt2,autism,0,Weird muscle spasms when I would get haircuts,8
z9xqt2,autism,1,"I used to have really short hair especially on the sides, and whenever the electric trimmer would get close to my ear, I also get an extreme sensation like im being stabbed in the side of my torso. What makes it worse is that none of these haircuts were voluntary(before i came out as trans) so since I was a “boy” I was forced to get my hair cut short even though I always wanted long hair and the haircut itself was extremely uncomfortable. I was just wondering if this was a trait any other ND people experience because it’s a really niche thing and I can’t find much information on it other than a few reddit threads on men’s forums. It was physically strenuous to hold still and stop my body from moving away from the trimmers.",138

z9y38l,BPD,0,How do I stop myself from splitting,7
z9y38l,BPD,1,So my boyfriend (we got back together) he makes stupid jokes (which I love) but over text my first response is to lash out and luckily I’ve grown enough to not fall into that and try to rationalize cause I know he’s harmless but my intrusive thoughts still get in the way I really need some advice on how to fight it better.,63
z9y38l,BPD,2,Btw these jokes are very light hearted and are not mean or meant to hurt me in anyway.,18
z9y38l,BPD,3,We joke all the time it’s just apart of our relationship and it’s great.,14
z9y38l,BPD,4,"My partner, my friends, and I are also like this and I also find myself responding with my immediate reaction, which is lashing out. Try taking a moment before responding to process how you feel and his intention in his texts. If you still feel angry, you can also communicate that what he said made you upset, even if it is just a joke.",64
z9y38l,BPD,5,"I like to imagine the tone of which the person would be saying it in if it were in person. 99% of the time, it’s that light-hearted joking-ness that I hear.",31
z9y38l,BPD,6,Thank you!!! Most of the time I know he’s joking but there’s always that little voice in the back of my head saying the basic stuff like “he means it.” “Lash out” “he’s trying to be mean.”,37
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,0,How I healed my back pain (Not exactly Neville stuff but I hope mods still approve it and it helps someone here),22
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,1,What I am about to share here is not exactly Neville stuff but basically it's still proof of how powerful our minds are and I am sure will help someone here.,31
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,2,"Anyway I had back problems for most of my life now. I was convinced it was from me growing up gaming and spending lot of time sitting in awkward positions which caused slight curvature in my back. When school started those school desks that I refer to as back breakers didn't help at all. Sitting in them for years and years caused me even more back pain and I was convinced this is never gonna go away. I am now almost 29 years old and I am working 12 hrs a day and I accepted this was gonna be something I am gonna deal with for the rest of my life. At best I hoped it would stay same and not get worse so I ""learned"" to live with it.",130
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,3,"Anyway few months back out of nowhere it got so bad and there was no reason for it to be this bad since I stopped working out, or doing anything that would cause this amount of pain or damage to my back. It got so bad that I couldn't even sit anymore, pain was getting unbearable, and at work I struggled to lift even empty boxes without bending in awkward positions and going through excruciating pain when sitting back up. I took vacation for 3 weeks but it didn't get any better, only worse. I would mostly just lay in my bed and hope it goes way but it didn't.",110
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,4,I hope this is not too much info but one day I couldn't even go to bathroom because sitting down put me in excruciating pain. I tried my best to take shower but I couldn't bend down to take off my socks and this is when I had enough of this BS.,52
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,5,"I sat back and tried to figure out what happened, did I damage some disc in my back, maybe some nerve damage or what is causing this? There has to be a reason.",33
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,6,I eventually realized similar thing happened many times in my life. I had once excruciating pain in my wrist for a week where I couldn't even use mouse or computer and recently even had so much pain in my right foot that I was limping for week and thought I broke my foot. So what was causing all this?,59
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,7,"I realized it was emotions. I know now many of you will roll your eyes and say get the fuck out of here with that Law of Attraction BS, and trust me I would once say that too but it's true.",41
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,8,"I realized it was anger, regret, anxiety. Every time I would feel these emotions it would fire up pain in my body instantly and my life these days is going to shit so I felt so much anger and regret and it caused all this pain. I realized I kept bottling up these emotions and never expressing them and my body was trying to tell me something. I knew there is something to this so I googled it. I researched all this and realized there are some people who realized the same thing. I even checked this sub and found one post that said the same thing, how they healed their back pain with book called ""Healing back pain by John Sarno"" and I found it on YT and listened.",130
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,9,"I knew he was telling the truth because I realized this my self. I kept listening and listening and listening and it made more sense every time and in less than 24 hours all pain was gone. I was in so much pain while listening to this book, I tried fighting off my mind that kept telling me this is BS and how my back is not gonna get better and how something is broken/damaged and I can't fix it with my mind alone. I kept bending down despite excruciating pain and I didn't let my mind win this time. I even went to workout and I couldn't lift my dumbells off floor with my arms because pain was too much but I would bend in very awkward positions and knew I had to beat my mind and pain was not real so I would lift them up any way I could and workout. I went to sleep and woke up with same pain but I didn't give up and during the day it just went away.",177
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,10,I swear I am not making this up. I just couldn't accept this shit anymore and I had to change it at any cost. Now I have 0 pain and If I accepted what my mind told me I would prob now be laying down on my bed and praying to die from all that pain.,56
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,11,Hey I believe it. I think a lot of things are psychosomatic. Do you mind sharing how you released those emotions or what you did specifically,26
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,12,Awesome! Now keep that momentum!,5
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,13,"It’s not BS, there is plenty of scientific evidence on Psychosomatic injuries which is what you are describing. Our minds are powerful tools. LOA, Neville Goddard, and others just call it something different and maybe add a little flair but they are all very similar concepts. Humans are limitless in their abilities. We just *think* we aren’t. Once we think we can do something, we can.",66
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,14,"If you want to push further, look into working on your mental diet. Changing those negative thought patterns changes your whole life and literally builds those new neural pathways in the brain.",32
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,15,Good for you OP! Looking forward to hearing more positive stories.,11
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,16,"Doctor Sarno's is the best. I had full-body pain and neuropathy. The worst symptom was burning skin from head to toe. After reading about psychosomatic illnesses, I was fully ""cured.""",30
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,17,Cured my endometriosis pain!,4
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,18,Wow that's amazing I hope this isn't one of those fake it till you make it scripting stories because dude results in 24 hrs thats really astonishing 😭 i personally got rid of my back nerve pain although it wasn't that sevre but as i stopped thinking about it and just declared i don't have it anymore within a month or few weeks i don't remember properly now but yeah it totally went away,74
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,19,"Also i totally beleive in the stuff you are talking about. Infact there are plenty of people especially some manifestation coach who talks about energy stuff and all . They got results like lighter eye colour , change in voice etc once they started doing energy work . It's surreal how our mind-body can do so much but we limit it with 3 d and logic stupidity",67
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,20,Yeaaaa team Sarno!!! Love seeing his name pop up here.,10
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,21,Cured my trigeminal neuralgia.,4
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,22,"No this is true. It’s all basically pointing out to the same truth that your inner world shapes your outer world. And emotions are part of the as well. If know how to feel our emotions without resisting them which is pretty hard especially with uncomfortable emotions like sadness or anger, then we won’t even manifest bodily pain or mental diseases. I personally used to have these unbearable headaches and then I realized that the root cause of it is repressed anger. Like my belief in the wrongness of anger manifests as headaches. I started looking into why I believe anger is bad and how I can feel my anger. Every time I get headaches I ask myself what am I angry at. By making my pain conscious and releasing it, I am relieved of unconscious need to manifest pain for myself. I have gotten really good at it that I don’t even experience headaches any more.",157
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,23,Truth is that we are conditioned to think emotions are bad and they mess things up while the truth is that they are just guiding you to see what you truly feel. They are not to be hold on to but rather felt.,43
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,24,"And in your case with the back pain, that’s absolutely true. It’s pent up emotions that feel like a burden which is why it manifests as back pain. It’s truly remarkable how we intelligent our bodies are. We just need to be better at listening to it.",47
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,25,"This is unrelated, but I haven't been able to see any new post on the sub",16

z9y871,NevilleGoddard,27,Congrats!,1
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,28,"I think more than anything it was just realization that the pain wasn't real. There wasn't any damage in my back, nothing was wrong with me. My mind was doing all this. I did feel intense relief and relaxation upon this realization so I guess I did release other emotions simultaneously too.",52
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,29,This! I don’t understand the hate for loa because it’s just a slightly different approach to the same thing. How I see it Neville just turned this principle into a very practical guide.,33

z9y871,NevilleGoddard,34,"Trust me it's not fake. I would not lie about this. It truly was unbearable/excruciating pain that I could not accept or deal with any longer. I also am not offering any ""coaching sessions"" or selling any books or promoting my youtube videos or anything like that so I gain nothing from lying about this.",55
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,35,"I do understand your suspicion. I have seen plenty of those fake success stories that were obvious scripting or lying for karma or obvious fake ""success"" stories to attract future clients when OP starts coaching.",35

z9y871,NevilleGoddard,44,Thank you :D,3
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,45,I kindly disagree with you on this 😉,8
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,46,"LOA is based on another paradigm (the universe decides, vibrations are manifesting, you've to take some inspired actions, etc.).",19
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,47,Not saying that LOA is bs or something. It's just an opposite conception of the art of manifestation.,18
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,48,"Yea, there is also science behind it. If you take out the energy and religion pieces, perception and therefore reality really is subjective. Tons of tedtalks on changing thought patterns and changing your perceptions. At the basic bare bones level, a lot of it comes down to re-wiring your brain and getting out of negative thought patterns. The basic concepts behind these things are all the same, we are the master of our own minds and therefore our thoughts and our own reality.",83
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,49,"I did pain reprocessing therapy. Look into Alan Gordon. I understood the science. I also woke up everyday and told myself ""today is going to be a good day."" Honestly my days were AWFUL for 8 months straight (around month 5 is when I started the process)...",47
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,50,I worked with SIRPA in the U.K. and also the Curable app. Learning about pain science and the complete belief in my body’s ability to heal myself was key. Also practising indifference towards the pain (ie no longer reacting to it with negative emotions).,44
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,51,If you have an email address you can PM me I can send you a google doc of resources,19
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,52,"Well, at the very least there is a huge overlap, and it might depend on what loa coach you’re following. I don’t think I’ve heard Hicks say that the universe decides. And to quote Neville: “your dimensionally larger self speaks to you through the language of desire. Do not de deceive yourself. Knowing what you want, claim you already have it, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give it to you” which sounds to me exactly the same as when Hicks talks about your higher being, or could be interpreted as ‘the universe’. And I know Neville says you can manifest without lifting a finger, but I feel like taking inspired action could be the same thing or very similar to Neville’s bridge of incidents. And when they say vibration attracts, in my interpretation it is basically like Neville’s state. When I focus on everything that is going right for me, and everything I have and love, instead of everything I lack and dislike, I am in the state of having and loving, giving me more things to have and love, or at least that’s how my experience has been.",192
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,53,"So while I don’t really disagree with you, I don’t think I’m entirely wrong either, but a lot of this might have to do with how I personally interpret and experience things :)",33

z9ybtt,CreditCards,0,Citi Costco Card with 4% on EV charging!,8
z9ybtt,CreditCards,1,"I've had the Citi Costco card for some time now which has been great obviously for Costco purchases as well as gas at 4%. That said, I transitioned to a Tesla Model 3 in the last year was bummed there weren't many options for CC for rewards on charging UNTIL I got an email from Citi in the last couple weeks that states that the 4% include EV charging! This must be relatively new cuz I haven't really seen it advertised on their website. I called Citi a few days ago and confirmed that you will get 4% on transactions that include ""Tesla"" or ""Charging."" The only other cards I know that offer good rewards on EV charging are from Uber. Curious to know if there are other cards other EV drivers would recommend!",134

unknown,unknown,3,what we even do in that club tho,8
unknown,unknown,4,I think it would be neat. We have a really good disability studies dept and history professors. I’d be interested in advocacy but also hangouts.,25

z9ys3y,mentalhealth,2,I’ve made massive strides but I’ve hit a point where I feel overwhelmed.,13
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,3,Spiraling thoughts that I can’t seem to shake off. Overwhelming/drowning feeling about job and bills and stuff.,17
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,4,I know logically what’s going on. I used to be able to logic away my issues. Like I could recognize what caused spiraling thoughts and stop them but it’s just not helping right now because of how overwhelming things are.,40
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,5,Deep breathing and som stretching would help…,7
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,6,Now it makes me feel physically nauseous.,7
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,7,I can’t eat (I know I need to) but it makes me feel sick as well.,16

z9ys3y,mentalhealth,15,Firstly understand that the ten steps you taken will always mean two back. That’s ok. Your 8 ahead. That’s really good.,21
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,16,At this stage you need to focus on 1% changes. Otherwise it’s overwhelming. What thing can you do today to make things 1% better for tomorrow?,26
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,17,I would say for now that’s to eat. Make sure you have something small for breakfast each day. That’s your challenge. Then for lunch. Then for dinner. Not a amazing meal for now but the rhythm of eating. Then challenge yourself to make a little more effort. Healthier food. New food. But each time one small step.,57

z9ytrm,sexualassault,1,"lately ive been watching predator catchers on youtube (like when they pose as minors to catch predators in the act of attempting to meet up with them for sex) and something that really helped me reframe my thinking surrounding the sexual assault i recently suffered is that whenever the predators start making excuses and say shit like ""i made a mistake"" theyre immediately called out and told ""no, you didnt make a mistake. you made a choice"". it just really put things in perspective for me and helped me stop making so many excuses for my ex and its helped me stop blaming myself so much (obviously im not fully to this point in my healing journey yet but again its been helpful). cuz yeah, my ex absolutely had control over his own actions and he chose to ignore my boundaries and chose to pressure me into sex while knowing i didnt want it. idk if this will help anyone else at all, but i just wanted to share that here.",171

z9z0n8,Dogtraining,0,My adolescent puppy is starting to bark. Help!,8
z9z0n8,Dogtraining,1,"My 9 month old sheepadoodle is starting to bark in the yard and looking at things out the window. She was a quiet little lamb up until this point. Are we doomed? How do you teach a dog “quiet” if they bark at random things? Also, if outside she’s not going to come if she’s riled up barking. Should we be using a long line in the yard for the foreseeable future so we have more control when this happens?",80
z9z0n8,Dogtraining,2,"When teaching the ""Quiet"" command you would need need a clicker and treats (or whatever your dog likes) and as soon as it stops barking even if its a split second praise keep doing it until it stops barking all together (also eventually over time also start adding a cue word after some repitetion)",54
z9z4gy,Jewish,0,Investigating Jewish ancestors- where to start?,6
z9z4gy,Jewish,1,Hi everyone!,2
z9z4gy,Jewish,2,"My father, uncle and I are keen to look into some family history. I did not grow up Jewish and converted as an adult. Since I've converted, my uncle has come to speak to me about something I'd not heard regarding our family history: my great-grandmother (and therefore my paternal grandmother) were apparently Jewish. We have absolutely no documented evidence of this, however. We're from a country in the former Yugoslavia, and so any evidence would have been disposed of during WWII in order to protect them from persecution. I don't know how feasible it is- but I also don't know how this story would have started if there was nothing to it either.",114
z9z4gy,Jewish,3,Has anyone got any experience with looking into things like this? I'm at a loss at where to start. My great-grandmother was born in Austria- should I start there?,29
z9z4gy,Jewish,4,"Austrian here. It’s mandatory for every inhabitant to have their permanent address registered with the authorities at all times and has been for a very long time - meaning since well into the imperial era, though historic consistency could be compromised if the place of residence ended up being part of another country at some point after the empire was dissolved or sometime inbetween.",64
z9z4gy,Jewish,5,"If you know where they used to live, you can get in touch with the registry office at the town hall (Gemeindeamt in villages, Rathaus or Magistrat in cities) or the national archives and ask them for help finding the historic records (Meldezettel). This should be independent from religious community records and will probably have survived the wars in most cases.",61
z9z4gy,Jewish,6,"Registering personal data like religion was obligatory until very recently, so if your great-grandmother was indeed Jewish, it will say mosaisch or israelitisch in the field for Bekenntnis (creed) on the Meldezettel records.",33
z9z4gy,Jewish,7,"Good luck and let me know if you need anything, I’m more than happy to help with small translations etc.",20
z9z4gy,Jewish,8,Check out jewishgen.org.,3
z9z4gy,Jewish,9,"If you have her name, birth year, and birth place you might be able to find more than you expect.",20
z9z4gy,Jewish,10,My mom tracked out family history. If you have names of family members/know the towns they lived in and when they were born you can see if their are records there (bear in mind you might need to also find someone to translate them to English and family names aren't always spelt consistently).,53
z9z4gy,Jewish,11,Unfortunately the Nazis destroyed a lot of records so you might not have much luck. But believe it or not the Mormon church is a really good resource. They have one of the best archives for birth records because they believe in baptising everyone.,44
z9z4gy,Jewish,12,"I will also say don't worry about not knowing where to start. Its a lot of detective work. For my mom, the process took time, sometimes progression was slow, only finding documents piecemeal, other times she'd find a document and make a bunch of breakthroughs. Either way, its really worth the effort. and Good luck :)",56
z9z4gy,Jewish,13,"I would start by taking a DNA test. If she's Ashkenazi, you'll get clear confirmation of it from the test.",20
z9z4gy,Jewish,14,You can also look through matches and their trees to see if you find anything.,15
z9z4gy,Jewish,15,I have done a completely document trail of my family tree. If you know your grandparents' names and birth years/ other family members it is just a matter of paper trail.,31
z9z4gy,Jewish,16,"All the good advice has already been given; just chiming in to say that this is very plausible, in case (as I perceive from what you wrote) you're skeptical. Many Ashkenazi Jews from Austrian-ruled parts of Europe (Bukovina, Galicia, Austria proper) ended up in Serbia well along the path to assimilation and usually conversion. (I know there were Sephardic communities there but I don't know much about their religious trajectories.)",70
z9z4gy,Jewish,17,Graveyard hunting,2
z9z4gy,Jewish,18,Seconded. This has been an invaluable resource and their newsletters are interesting.,12
z9z4gy,Jewish,19,DNA tests aren't always a good indication of Jewish ancestry. For all they know they might not even be Ashkenazi.,20
z9z4gy,Jewish,20,Thirded. My favorite database to use!,6
z9z4gy,Jewish,21,"So as I said, if this ancestor was Ashkenazi it's a good indicator. Ashkenazi DNA is distinct and easily identifiable. If you have any significant amount of Ashkenazi DNA, it will show up in your results.",36
z9z4gy,Jewish,22,"If the ancestor was Sephardic from the Balkans, a DNA test is still a really good idea. If you look at the 23&Me results of Sephardic Jews from the Balkans, they virtually always get somewhere from 20-45% Ashkenazi in their results. So even if OP is 12.5% Jewish on paper, it would very likely show up in the results.",59
z9z4gy,Jewish,23,"Even if Ashkenazi didn't show up in the results (It very likely would), if you're Serbian or Croatian and you're getting significant results that include a combination of Italian, Broadly Southern European, and Middle Eastern and North African, that's a very strong indicator of Sephardic ancestry as well. The odds that OP would see either Ashkenazi and/or this combination of Southern European and Middle Eastern if they are truly 12.5% Jewish is virtually 100%.",74
z9z4gy,Jewish,24,"A fully Jewish ancestor (Ashkenazi or otherwise) in the last 4 generations is more likely than not to show up unambiguously in a DNA test. But especially if Ashkenazi, it's not going to be very helpful for discovering details of their background.",42
z9z4gy,Jewish,25,Fourthed. I'm a professional and when people ask me what I use... I surprise them by saying that JewishGen is still my first (plus) stop,25
z9z4gy,Jewish,26,"Oh absolutely and also like you said it's a good idea to look at matches as well. For cases like this I'd recommend using Ancestry, this way you can build up a tree and with their DNA testing they match you to others who have also taken the tests and you can find ancestors you had no clue about.",59
z9z4gy,Jewish,27,"Yep, I found out I had more Jewish ancestry than I knew of through one of my great grandmothers, and no one in the family knew. It came up in my DNA test, along with the rest of my Ashkenazi ancestry, and they were able to pinpoint some of the countries her line originated from.",55

z9zovj,Destiny,0,Don't let establishment Republican voices like Shapiro distance themselves from the Ye drama. This is a direct result from allowing conspiracy nutjobs into your party.,25
z9zovj,Destiny,1,"The former Republican president of the US just had dinner with these guys a few days ago. Even saying he liked Fuentes. These Republicans are going to play this off like this has nothing to do with them. Fuck you, you made your bed now lay in it.",48
z9zovj,Destiny,2,I see “moderate” swing district House members denouncing Fuentes but are silent on Trump. Don’t let these cucks get away with going halfway on denouncing hatred and bigotry. Steven was right the Republicans made their bed now it’s time to lie in the shit that they let infest their party. Only way for them to learn is for this to fucking obliterate them,63
z9zovj,Destiny,3,Charlie Kirk was dick riding hard last year and has now scrubbed every mention of ye from his twitter,19

Although his opinions on gay marriage is dogshit for sure. I just don’t think it’s fair to lump him in with people like Alex Jones and Ye.",62
z9zovj,Destiny,6,LMAO you’re reaching so hard,5
z9zovj,Destiny,7,Trump talks to anyone with significance. He has a pre existing relationship with Kanye. And he told Kanye to fuck off when he went crazy.,25
z9zovj,Destiny,8,"The Republican Party is more pro Israel than the democrats, so I don’t know where you get this idea that literal Jewish people have no right to tell anti semites to get out of their party. Unhinged.",37
z9zovj,Destiny,9,"Doesn't Ye want to run independent anyway? I mean he'd run R way before D of course, but I doubt you can actually pin this current shitshow to republicans",29
z9zovj,Destiny,10,Okay but what then?,4

z9zovj,Destiny,18,"Sincerely, Republicans running in 2024 and 2026.",7
z9zovj,Destiny,19,"None of these people involved in this are republicans. Kanye, Fuentes, Milo...all have a history of hating the republican party. Even very conservative people like Matt Walsh and Shapiro wouldn't consider any of these people conservative or republican...just like Destiny wouldn't consider Jackson Hinkle or Jimmy Dore true leftists. This is a moronic post. Republicans love Israel and Jews even more then most Democrats. If anything a large part of the democratic party hates Zionism and is pretty outright anti-Semitic also. See Ilhan Omar and Rashid Talib. Also nobody ""lets"" people into parties homie...that isn't how this works. Obviously Shapiro would denounce everything YE is saying...hes Jewish. This post is just partisan hackery. Sorry bro.",115
z9zovj,Destiny,20,"This is really important to remember if Trump is convicted of anything and can't run. They'll try to disassociate from him and they can't be allowed to, hopefully democrats will keep track of their asskissing and deploy that information well.",40
z9zovj,Destiny,21,The problem is that Kanye said the quiet part out loud.,11
z9zovj,Destiny,22,Supporting Trump in 2020 means supporting his baggage and horde of conspiracy rotted brained crazies he brought with him. He doesn't get off the hook imo.,26

z9zovj,Destiny,24,"Based. The repubs, even the most extreme ones, are all rhetoric, when it comes to policy they all voted to send money to Ukraine, and are even now changing course to appeal more to moderates by passing the gay marriage bill. The repubs are dogshit, but lets not act they're on the level of nazis.",55
z9zovj,Destiny,25,I mean this whole thing transpired because of Trump 2016.,10
z9zovj,Destiny,26,"This is basically direct result of what happens when people treat politics like sports teams. With sports you want your opponent to be shit so you can win easily but with politics you actually want both sides to be as strong as possible so they feel like the only way for them to ""beat their opponent"" is by doing as good of a job as possible to appeal the voters. If you would have either side be complete crap and irredeemable for the public for some time, this would only lead to the leading side taking as much of an advantage of the position they are in as possible- fuck the ordinary people, they will still have to vote for them because in their perception the other side is even worse",131
z9zovj,Destiny,27,"Reverse the roles for a second and let's say they met with Obama and not Trump. You think Shapiro would be like ""Hey guys I'm sure Obama wanted nothing to do with them so we shouldn't get on the Dems about this."" Yeah no fucking way. I don't see why we should be more charitable than they would be.",59
z9zovj,Destiny,28,"I mean no, I would never expect republicans to have spines or morals. We should never expect them to denounce any craziness in their party. Atleast they're dying in greater numbers than democrats.",33
z9zovj,Destiny,29,TIL supporting a candidate for a political position means you support literally everything halfway adjacent to them,17
z9zovj,Destiny,30,"I mean Ben didn’t like trump from the get go either but he voted for him in 2020 because the Republican Party aligns up with his ideals more. I know a lot of people that vote republican because they agree with them more on issues even if they hate the candidate. I did. Now in retrospect, after the election denial stuff and janurary 6th stuff I won’t be supporting the Republican Party again, at least for a long time. But I get why some people vote for their party even if the candidate is not good.",96
z9zovj,Destiny,31,"What, Ye saying he loves Hitler?",6
z9zovj,Destiny,32,"Well, shapiro can do w.e he wants, that doesn't mean we should follow what they're doing. We should have more agency.",21
z9zovj,Destiny,33,Hahahahahahaha. You're such a good person.,6
z9zovj,Destiny,34,>he voted for him but he didn't like him,9
z9zovj,Destiny,35,It's time for conservatives to grow the fuck up and accept that this doesn't change that they're responsible for the shit ***they voted in***,24

z9zovj,Destiny,37,I'm just tired of people that storm the capitol and deny covid. It's exhausting when half the country is caught in a fever dream.,24
z9zovj,Destiny,38,"To be fair, most Republicans that aren't terminally online, which is probably the majority of Republicans that actually vote don't really know or care who Kanye or nick fuentes or any of these people are. My dad likes Trump and voted for him but I'd bet my left arm that he isn't even aware of anything thats happened with Kanye over the past month",64
z9zovj,Destiny,39,"Who votes in insane talk by Ye, Fuentes, and Milo? Conservatives didn't vote for this. These three hate the republican party. WTF are you even talking about? Trump doesn't believe in any of this shit.",35

z9zovj,Destiny,51,Do you really think the Q Anon Shaman was going to overturn the results of the election?,17

z9zxv6,Peterborough,1,I've lived here my whole life and I've never figured out what's actually going on there. It almost looks like an abandoned motel but I see vehicles there and random mattresses thrown around.,33

za055k,askatherapist,0,How can I help a depressed child?,7
za055k,askatherapist,1,I work as a teachers aid at an elementary school. One of the children in the third grade class I primarily work in shows significant signs of depression. She comes from a troubled home life and is wise beyond her years,41
za055k,askatherapist,2,….in a really bad way.,5
za055k,askatherapist,3,"She speaks and behaves almost more like an angsty pre teen than an 8 year old child. She struggles with coping skills and every time something doesn’t go her way she breaks down like the world is falling apart and everyone is out to get her. If someone hurts her on accident, she will not listen to them apologize, she just decides they did it on purpose and doesn’t want to hear otherwise. She acts like she’s horribly bullied but she has a group of friends who just kind of get fed up with her drama at times and don’t wanna hang out anymore. She does have days where other kids are mean to her, it’s a problem at our school, but she also can be a bully herself.",129
za055k,askatherapist,4,How can I help raise the self esteem of a child who absolutely doesn’t want to be helped and seems to want the drama of being the victim? What can I do for her?,34
za055k,askatherapist,5,"Listen to her, whatever she needs or wants to talk about. As well as acting as a safety valve to burn off unwanted feelings, listening is the way we show someone they are likeable and worthy.",36
za055k,askatherapist,6,"Without changing her core situation, there is a limit to what you can do to change her. But listening without trying to steer the conversation or impose a view should help her feel better and people who feel better tend to act better.",43
za055k,askatherapist,7,She will be capricious and unreasonable sometimes. That's ok. Allowing her to express her feelings means listening to some odd thoughts.,21
za055k,askatherapist,8,"Secondary tack might be to increase her sense of autonomy: ask her advice on minor things, allow her to make decisions etc. And even if in reality she has little choice in some areas, ask her which thing she might like to do first and so on.",47
za055k,askatherapist,9,"Lastly, I wish every troubled child had someone like you caring about them. Thank you for what you do.",19
za055k,askatherapist,10,oh man thats like looking into a mirror haha. always helped to have teachers when they seemed like they really tried to make a connection with me and understand me and just be a safe space. maybe ask before or after class how theyre doin and that youre there for them or whatever. i remember that being a little awkward for me but its kinda nice to know at the same time,72
za055k,askatherapist,11,"I’m gonna be honest, I’m autistic and drama was something I struggled with growing up. I tended to use drama for attention because at school it seemed to be the thing that made the other girls care about one another. Whoever was the saddest that day had the most people surrounding them. So as an adult drama is something I struggle with because it’s hard for me not to see it as wanting attention. I find myself getting annoyed when something minor happens and she’s crying AGAIN, but I’m also trying really hard to change my viewpoint and figure out why the behavior is happening.",105
za055k,askatherapist,12,I appreciate everyone’s help so far.,6
za055k,askatherapist,13,But what is wrong with wanting attention?,7
za055k,askatherapist,14,NAT!,1
za055k,askatherapist,15,"I was kinda like this too when I was younger. I think a big part of it is that the kid probably does want attention, she just doesn’t know how to ask for it appropriately. I had all these feelings and things going on but I didn’t know how to ask anyone for help, so I did things that I thought might help me connect with people. Sometimes it worked in a way, but it’s hard to form meaningful connections when I wasn’t even fully aware I needed help. That was just my life. Hope that kinda makes sense :)",100
za055k,askatherapist,16,"Whenever we feel like a kid is out to get attention, replace the word attention with connection and that's probably the more true statement.",24
za055k,askatherapist,17,Goes for more than just children!,6
za055k,askatherapist,18,"But also, there's genuinely nothing wrong with wanting attention. It's a normal human need.",14
za055k,askatherapist,19,"Many of us were brought up to feel like we are ""too much."" Like we want and need too much. We've taken a normal human need for attention and proclaimed it ""too much,"" fought against it, then we see it in others & it brings up reactions in us.",49
za055k,askatherapist,20,"But it's OK to want attention. It's OK to want comfort and soothing. And especially for children, they have to be taught how to self soothe and self comfort. And if nobody teaches them how...and nobody provides them external soothing and comfort... they will desperately be looking for it. Potentially their whole lives.",53
za055k,askatherapist,21,"I'm 35 years old, and I was neglected. I want attention... I want my therapist's attention. I want his comfort. I internalize it & use it when I am alone to soothe my own young parts.",36

za0d5d,travel,2,"I'm not a fast paced kind of person so my original plan was to spend a few months exploring and living in Thailand, to really get a good experience of the place and be immersed in the culture. Of course I was open to visiting a couple of other countries as well whilst I am over there. There is a multiple entry tourist visa for Thailand that I can use for up to 6 months, although I will have to leave the country after 60 days before I can re-enter, which costs £150.",93
za0d5d,travel,3,"However, I am also aware that currently I can spend 45 days in Thailand on a visa exemption, and possibly another if I return (although I'm not 100% sure on this). Considering this is free, and I'm quite keen now on visiting countries like Vietnam on a month-long visa, I am now undecided on whether its worth spending that much money for the long term Thailand visa if I can hop around other countries instead.",75
za0d5d,travel,4,What would people recommend? Is it worth getting the multiple entry visa? I know some people who go on a visa exemption to Thailand and say it isn't long enough!,30

za0l8g,AITAH,0,AITAH for being upset my fiancé skipped a birthday dinner I planned?,12
za0l8g,AITAH,1,So I asked all week what he wanted to do for his birthday and he said idk every time I asked. Last year I threw him a party and he loved it! This year I told him I wanted to do something special but he didn’t give me any ideas so I book a couple reservations so he could pick one. I even took off work:( Today is his birthday and he just left to hang out with his friend and said he wouldn’t make dinner :-/. I texted him saying I am a little hurt ur not letting me give u something nice on your birthday and he said he is just never going to tell me when he is going to hang out with friends because it ruins everything. And for context I was invited for a family thing they did a couple of days back but he had them schedule it when I was working. I know it’s his birthday but I am feeling a little sad and left out and disappointed I wasn’t able to do something special with him and he didn’t want to do anything with me.,193
za0l8g,AITAH,2,"Sounds like he's your boyfriend, not your fiance. You are NTA for being upset. Be careful about this guy. Sounds like a flake.",23
za0l8g,AITAH,3,NTA:,1
za0l8g,AITAH,4,"It's raining red flags babe! The streets are absolutely flooded with them! If he's already showing that he has little to no interest in spending time with you or any consideration for the effort made on your part to do something special FOR HIM, then what can you expect in return? When it's your birthday or a day worth celebrating? Do you think he'll put any effort into making it special for you? I'll wait....I thought as much. Don't waste your time or energy on someone who doesn't deserve you. Much love!",92
za0l8g,AITAH,5,So I just went back and read your post from 34 days ago about him not sticking up for you. I saw your edit that he added that girl back on snap and tried to hide it from you.,39
za0l8g,AITAH,6,"Do you not see these huge red flags?? If you want to know how he spent his birthday, probably want to check out her snapchat or IG….",27
za0l8g,AITAH,7,"He sounds like an idiot, he's never going warn you when he want to hang out with his friends? What?",20
za0l8g,AITAH,8,"I had a boyfriend like yours. My friends said that I was going out with him, but he wasn't going out with me. Are you sure he's your boyfriend or are you just his FWB?",35
za0l8g,AITAH,9,"NTA....if he acts like this in the ""still not married, I better act decent"" phase..it will get much worse once you are married. You may want to take a hard look at what you want...and consider if he is willing to make any effort for you....",46
za0l8g,AITAH,10,I have many friends who have wasted a decade plus only to finally get dumped when the trash significant other/fiance moves on (cheats) with whomever they feel is more important.,30
za0l8g,AITAH,11,"NTA. This is not going to be what you want to hear but this comes across like he doesn’t want you to be an active part of the rest of his life, and potentially could be cheating.",37
za0l8g,AITAH,12,"Deliberately excluding you from his family is a major, major red flag (assuming he was actually with his family). By getting married you would be his family so this is really odd.",32
za0l8g,AITAH,13,"The attitude of ‘I don’t need to tell you were I’m going or when I’m doing things’ is an attitude someone has to something they’re casually seeing, not their fiancé. Again, major, major red flag (again, assuming he was actually with his friends).",43
za0l8g,AITAH,14,"The other issue is NOT that he wouldn’t let you do something nice for him, it’s that you made plans that he knew about in advance and he didn’t show up. If he does that for HIS birthday, he’s going to do it on other occasions that don’t revolve around him.",51
za0l8g,AITAH,15,"I’m really surprised that someone would propose to a partner then treat them like this to be honest. It sounds like either he’s pushing you out and a break up may be coming, or he’s cheating.",36
za0l8g,AITAH,16,"NTA you were invited but he purposely had them schedule it when you couldn’t be there? sweetie, you fiancé doesn’t like you very much",24
za0l8g,AITAH,17,Nta and honestly it kinda sounds like he’s cheating on you and giving a bad excuse,16
za0l8g,AITAH,18,Sounds like he doesn't even like you tbh. Take a look at your relationship. This behavior is not normal in couples.,21
za0l8g,AITAH,19,"NTA, get your ducks in row. Sounds like that dude wants to get rid of you",16
za0l8g,AITAH,20,"NTAH. He's being a jerk. If he wanted to spend time with his friends, fine but he needed to communicate with you since you made it clear by repeatedly asking him what he wanted to do on his birthday that you wanted to spend time with him, so not discussing this with you is rude af.",56
za0l8g,AITAH,21,"That, combined with the family thing is giving me red flags. Are you sure this man loves you?",18
za0l8g,AITAH,22,NTA but you will be if you stay with him. He doesn’t respect you or care about your feelings. You need to move on and find someone who will treat you right.,32
za0l8g,AITAH,23,Someone mistreating you is their fault. Allowing them to continue doing it is your fault...,15
za0l8g,AITAH,24,"NTA for how you feel, but YWBTA to yourself if you keep wasting energy on him. He made it clear to you that you are not important or a priority. He is purposefully making sure you can’t make or be involved in events. Sounds like he might be seeing someone else and even if he isn’t, I’m not sure how much more clear he could be on how little he respects you and your time.",75
za0l8g,AITAH,25,"This is another of these NTA for being upset, but YTA a little bit for hanging on to a guy like this and thinking you're going to be able to build a future with him. Y'all need a bit more self-respect and a bit less him in the mix. I'm sure his friends will be happy to have him.",59
za0l8g,AITAH,26,He’s not a keeper. Only cares about himself. More fish in the sea!,13
za0l8g,AITAH,27,What is he? 12?,4
za0l8g,AITAH,28,NTA. Do not marry this person.,6
za0l8g,AITAH,29,"NTA run fast, run far.",5
za0l8g,AITAH,30,"I misread 'fiancé ' as 'friend' and was going to say this guy obviously does not consider you to be a close friend, you like him more than he likes you. I think that still stands. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life in that position?",50

za0l8g,AITAH,32,I have many friends who have wasted a decade plus only to finally get dumped when the trash significant other/fiance moves on (cheats) with whomever they feel is more important.,30
za0l8g,AITAH,33,"Ok I'm not sure I'm reading this right. You wanted to do something special and you kept asking him what to do. His answer was always ""I don't know"". So you made restaurant reservations. Did he know you made those reservations? Not mind reading or the hints were obvious, but you said ""I made reservations for your birthday dinner at 6 on your actual birthday, sound good?"".",67
za0l8g,AITAH,34,If you told him clearly about the plans then he's definitely in the wrong. If you just assumed he would know you finally came up with an idea then you're in the wrong.,33
za0l8g,AITAH,35,Definitely NTA and i would be incredibly hurt too! Yeah it’s his birthday but you talked to him and tried to plan something for him and he completely blew you off like you don’t matter. He’s very inconsiderate and even a little selfish and rude. He he like that in other aspects of your relationship?,55
za0l8g,AITAH,36,"I mean it’s not cool or okay what he did, he’s definitely moving suspicious. He’s clearly showing he doesn’t fancy your company much, or want you to be around his friends!! It’s also for a reason you need to find out the reason! Besides that don’t be to hurt, find something you enjoy doing, keep your money with this economy every penny counts! You make sure you get your lick back too! He doesn’t sound mature though, and seems very odd by your wording, such ass never going to tell you when he’s going to hang out because it ruins everything. Can you detail what he meant it doesn’t sit well with what you texted him.",116
za0l8g,AITAH,37,Did you ever communicate your plans to him? Did he actually know you had taken off work and made plans?,20
za0l8g,AITAH,38,I’d be super hurt!! NTA! You guys clearly have some things to work out about hanging out with other friends figure out giving each other time alone with some friends if you want and also why can’t you be prt of that hang out sometimes? Especially being his SO on his birthday🤷‍♀️,52
za0l8g,AITAH,39,NTA - He doesn’t care enough about you to include you in his plans. Please take this as face value.,20
za0l8g,AITAH,40,NRA. Grab you fiancé’s hair tightly so you can pull his head out of his ass - it is so far up. Fiancé trumps friends in spontaneous stuff. Tell him to grow up,33
za0l8g,AITAH,41,NTA.,1
za0l8g,AITAH,42,Girl please take those blinders off so you can see all the red flags.,14
za0l8g,AITAH,43,Are you sure he was hanging out with friends? These are not behaviors of a fiance. Please look really hard into this relationship and decide if this is the lifelong commitment you deserve.,33
za0l8g,AITAH,44,"Oh honey, seems like he is not in a relationship with you anymore.",13
za0l8g,AITAH,45,NTH he doesn't seem to care about you,8
za0l8g,AITAH,46,"NTA, but I bet your fiancé has a girlfriend or two that he is spending time with. Time to reevaluate what you want in life.",25
za0l8g,AITAH,47,Run!!!!,1
za0l8g,AITAH,48,"Next time, do not surprise him so he will know that that time is to focus on the two of you. This way, there are no misses.",27
za0l8g,AITAH,49,"Having them reschedule a get together when she won't be able to make it sounds like hes got a foot out the door. Now the bday no show, he's saying alot here.",32
za0l8g,AITAH,50,Yup these comments are correct. This is not going to get better after you're married. You don't want to be locked down into a marriage where your feelings are being disregarded. Don't settle for that kind of treatment especially from a potential life partner. You will always complain about this issue and similar issues. Run while you still can.,59
za0l8g,AITAH,51,NTA I am sorry for you but his attitude is problematic. He purposely arranges to exclude you from a family thing where you were invited? He won’t tell you when he goes out with his friends because it ruins the fun? Are you sure you want to spend your life with this person? The disrespect is staggering.,57
za0l8g,AITAH,52,Oh.... He's distancing himself from you. Be prepared for a break up in the near future.,16
za0l8g,AITAH,53,"Red flag full stop. If they chose to hang out with ""friends"" on their birthday instead of you I would look into what ""friends"" were there. . . Sounds like side action",32
za0l8g,AITAH,54,"He wants you to break up with him. Everything he's doing it, screams it.",14
za0l8g,AITAH,55,"Run. RUN. A fiance who wants to ""hang out with his friends"" without YOU on his birthday? If you're LUCKY, he's just a selfish narcissistic jerk who's showing how little he cares about you. But I'm guessing he spent his birthday with his girlfriend.",44
za0l8g,AITAH,56,NTA he’s an overgrown man child. It’s obvious that he doesn’t care about you.,14
za0l8g,AITAH,57,INFO: Why are you wasting your life with this jackass?,10
za0l8g,AITAH,58,He's just not into you any longer. Who asks someone to schedule an event when you are working?,18
za0l8g,AITAH,59,Are you sure he hasn't got another secret gf hidden somewhere because he's going to great lengths to avoid you. NTA but he's showing you who he really is so take heed and reconsider this relationship. He's a walking bag of red flags right now.,45
za0l8g,AITAH,60,Is his friend male or female if female than he might be cheating,13
za0l8g,AITAH,61,"Hello BF's butt, let me introduce my feet. Feet, meet butt HARD!!! BF, GTFO!",14
za0l8g,AITAH,62,"Sounds like fiancé may be having second thoughts about the engagement. If you were his priority, he wouldn’t blow off your prior plans for his own plans that he’s never going to tell you about. If he’s serious about never telling you, is that the kind of life you want? For that matter, is his current actions what you want?",60

za0l8g,AITAH,68,Why would it ruin it if he tells you he’s going to hang out with his friends? Is this purely a bizarre and shitty attitude from him or have you fought about it in the past?,36
za0l8g,AITAH,69,NTA.,1
za0l8g,AITAH,70,People prioritize what’s important to them. Period. You weren’t included in the family event and he bailed on you for his birthday. He is telling you that you are not a priority and not important to him. I’m so sorry. That would not feel good. Your actions were thoughtful and caring. You deserve the same thoughtful response and level of effort in return. This relationship doesn’t sound like it’s in your best interest.,73
za0l8g,AITAH,71,Does he do anything wonderful for your b-day.,8
za0l8g,AITAH,72,"He made sure she wasnt included in the family event, he intentionally excluded her from his birthday, and purposefully left her alone at home on a milestone event. sounds like he goes to great length to make sure she knows she is not important and part of his life, this is more than casually flaky behavior, he is isolating her and ignoring her, and the overt disrespect in his words that he is never going to tell her about hanging our with friends, i see serious emotional abuse in op's future.",91
za0l8g,AITAH,73,"How come that the status and responsability change immediatly after getting engaged? I am not engaged, but my boyfriend already has all responsabilities he will have as a husband (except Children of course). I don´t get that the labeling is so important for your role.",45

za0l8g,AITAH,75,"Barely a boyfriend, at that.",5
za0l8g,AITAH,76,I bet he’s either cheating or already warned the friend group OP is on the way out.

Plus trying to flip the responsibility to OP with “you’ve ruined everything?”,51

za0l8g,AITAH,78,See. This.,2

za0l8g,AITAH,100,"If she never made it clear what the plans were then he's not wrong for thinking there aren't any. Not everyone celebrates their birthday on their actual birthday. Perhaps he thought it would be a weekend thing. Or perhaps he thought she would do something but then she was home and nothing, nothing, nothing so when his friends invited him to something he frustratedly picked something over nothing. He's not a mind-reader and shouldn't be blamed for her lack of communication. It's his birthday, he can spend it how he wants. He didn't break plans with her to hang out with his friends because he didn't know there were plans.",110

He even has the day off of work, but so far all he's done is watch a movie by himself. My friends invited me to go out but I said no because I'm sure he'll do something. Well reddit, he didn't. We got in a big fight at bedtime and he says I'm TA for blaming him that I didn't go with my friends. He never said we had plans so it's my fault for assuming.

za0zan,selfimprovement,1,"I thought thought by getting a good job or joining the National Guard again or getting married that I was going to be alright. That, ""This time, I'm going to be Happy and need no more."" What I've come to realize though is that I'm simply a restless human being who constantly needs to try new things and meet new people. I can't settle on working one job for the rest of my life any more because there's more to life than just that!",84
za0zan,selfimprovement,2,"Being alive and living that life, to me, means that you constantly need to reinvent yourself. Learn new skills. You can go to school, play the flute, learn how to cook, draw, work one job for a year or two and then switch to another one. Keep pushing yourself to learn and interact with other's who in turn will teach you new insights, skills, tricks, etc.",66
za0zan,selfimprovement,3,"Ever since I was a kid (I'm 37), I felt this sort of restlessness. Everyone around me always told me to get a job, marry, settle down. My first marriage was a complete fuck up (through my own actions) and my life was falling a part. Then, something within me sort of, snapped into place. Fast forward a few years and I'm just overall, happy. Sure, I fuck up here and there (again, self doing) but I think that's to remind me that I'm human . As long you keep it moving and DOING SOMETHING to better yourself as a human being and contributing to your little (or big) tribe, you'll be fine.",113

My opening balance at 1/1/22 was about $24,700 and my current balance is $26,400.

za2k52,AmItheAsshole,0,AITA for going off on my sister for not taking the dog out?,13
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,1,Some back story: my sister (26F) and I (28F) grew up in an abusive household. We lost contact with eachother for almost 8 years. We reconnected almost 2 years ago and decided to move in together. During that 8 years I adopted a pitbull from an abusive and neglective environment. She came with me when I moved in with my sister.,61
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,2,So we both work full time and more often than not my sister is home hours before I am. When I leave for work I put my dog into a crate (something I hate doing but if I don't she likes to get into the garbage out of boredom). The only thing I ask of her is when she is done with her 30 minute break (We have a household policy that when you get home you take 30 minutes to yourself and relax) then take the dog out so she can do her business.,95
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,3,"For the last year, year and half roughly, my sister has gotten in the habit of getting home and getting on a game or falling asleep before taking her out. So when I get home the dog is still in her crate and there would be pee and poop in it and I'd have to clean it up.",58
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,4,"Last night was one of those nights and the dog hasn't been feeling well. So her poop is...liquid. There was poop EVERYWHERE in the crate and on the dog. I lost it. I busted my way into her room (thinking she fell asleep again so thinking I'd have to make as much noise as possible to wake her up). All I asked was if the dog has been out yet. Granted in a yelling tone. She took the dog out and when she came back in I asked her what her issue is. I don't ask her for rent, though she pays half anyways. I don't ask her to help clean, she barely does that. All I ask is for her to take the dog out. She just kept apologizing and said she lost track of time from being on her game. I'm a gamer as well but if I know something needs to be done I do that first then get online. I told her that if she can't do that then she is gonna have to have to find somewhere else to stay. Or I leave. She got mad at me calling me an asshole because she can't afford to live on her own. And that she knows she messed up but I don't need to take it that far.",222
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,5,So AITA??,2
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,6,Edit: there seems to be some confusion about if I'm the landlord. I am not. I am a tenant as much as my sister is. I paid for the deposit but that's a mute point.,35
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,7,Edit 2: if my sister walks the dog when she gets home the dog is in there for 4 or 5 hours at the most. If I walk her when I get home and she has been in the cage when I get home it's going on 9 hours at most.,51
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,8,"Edit 3: at this time dog sitters are a no go for me. I have hired people 3 times and all 3 times it was a bad experience. For both my dog, me, and the personal belongings. I am prepared to rehome her if I really must. So let's avoid making assumptions in the comments. Thank you",57
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,9,"Edit 4: I get it, ITA for having a dog while working 40 hours. Other than telling me I need to rehome her how about some suggestions on how to fix boredom. I did not go into her background because I did not feel it necessary to the original post. She was almost 3 years old when I took her in. She was not house trained whatsoever. Had no obedience training. Was not fixed nor had ever had shots since she was still a puppy. She had bite marks and still has scars from other dogs all over her. Especially on her neck and right hind leg. She is terrified of small dogs and hates big dogs. I got her trained, fixed, updated shots, and mostly house trained while still working 40 hour work weeks. The only huge issue I'm facing right now is her boredom or maybe it's anxiety. Idk. She gets into EVERYTHING if left to her own devices. At one point in particular I rushed her to a vet hospital because she thought cleaning chemicals were something to snack on. I learned my lesson on that one. I have to put her in the crate for her own safety at this point. As long as she gets walked every 5/6 hours maximum then there's no mess of any kind. No poop, pee, trash, cushions, pieces of wall anywhere.",231

I just have to pay a ""pet fee"" every month and have liability insurance and show she is fixed and is updated on her shots. I'm waiting on a promotion from my work in 4 months to be able to afford a home loan so I give this dog at least a yard to run around in.

I have tried everything from a specialist dog trainer to gross tasting sprays that ""makes puppies uninterested in chewing things"", to simply taking a trash out before I leave. This adorable dumbo thought it was a good idea to get into the cabinet where I kept (not anymore) cleaning chemicals. She almost died! I got home just in time and rushed her to the vet hospital and had her stomach pumped! She stayed there for almost a week for observation it was so bad. YOU may never had to use crates but I'm not you. And nor was I lucky enough to find this fur brain when she was still a puppy. I got her when she was almost 3 years old and she wasn't house trained! *I* got her to be house trained. Or are least to a point where she can hold it longer than she originally could. As long as she gets walked every 5/6 hours everything is fine.",222
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,46,It was the original agreement that she wouldn't have to pay rent if she walks the dog a few times during the day. She decided on her own to pay half the rent when she got a pay raise. So she sends me money through zelle. But she said she'd still walk the dog when she gets home. And I agree it's not her responsibility. I'm just one of those that does what they say they are gonna do. If that makes sense. We are gonna talk about it when I get home tonight. But I'm just seeing if maybe I messed up our relationship too far over this..if that makes sense. Just so I have an idea on how I should talk to her.,125
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,47,"Even if the dog is not her responsibility, she should have a big enough heart to attend to the dog if needed. Dogs are family. I'm glad you prioritise your pooch when you get home.",35
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,48,"…yes, anyone who is not available to take care of their pets should not have them. your dog almost DIED and you are somehow spinning that story to make yourself out to be the hero that saved her, not the ignorant fool who put her in that position.",48
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,49,wow looks like some of your family members behaviour has rubbed off on you. do you understand how dogs work or how children work? you don’t deserve a dog really. YOU have no time for a dog that especially needs it. you’re a selfish person and making yourself a victim in a situation you created and are here barking at people for being right and honest to you. why should someone who has no time for children have kids anyway? are you dumb? you are trying to paint yourself as a good and failing bc ur just describing awful shit your dog is going through because of your neglect and lack of time. dogs are like toddlers and a full time job. if you cared for this dog you’d give it to someone who can actually care for it. your dog almost died because of YOU you are no hero. you’re a dog abuser.,154
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,50,I think her paying rent was a way to communicate that she can no longer take the dog for walks. Maybe you should find an alternative for your pet. Understandably she could be exhausted herself after work.,37
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,51,I can see she's tried to make things right by paying rent now she has more of an income. I'd say have a conversation about it ☺️,27
za33q5,Aliexpress,0,Seller taking too long to send the product,8
za33q5,Aliexpress,1,"25/11 i bought a graphics card on cpu top store, and it still not been sent by the seller, is this normal? What should i do? I already contacted the seller and I said I need the graphics card to be sent before December, then they said they are going to send as soon as possible, it still not sent. Idk what to do, and i need this graphics card in my pc before January. Btw I'm from Brazil",79
za33q5,Aliexpress,2,"This is why you shouldn’t buy stuff you will need within 4 months on Ali, especially with all the corona lockdowns going on there.",24
za33q5,Aliexpress,3,Besides that you shouldn’t buy PC parts on there either the chance you won’t get what you ordered is gigantic.,20
za33q5,Aliexpress,4,I believe they have to send within a few days and if they don’t it will get canceled automatically. Otherwise if they generated a shipping label you will have to wait until the date it should have been delivered.,39
za33q5,Aliexpress,5,"Similar situation with 2 orders of mine, they face a lot of issues with logistics and having orders shipped due to lockdowns.",22
za33q5,Aliexpress,6,But regardless you should never ever rely on the delivery date on such long shipments. Usually aliexpress gives a 2 month period for the items to be delivered before you can ask for a refund. This shows how much an order can take to arrive and I believe that this is an optimistic scenario as well.,56
za33q5,Aliexpress,7,"Please consult our [Shipping & Tracking FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aliexpress/comments/gr6tu8/faq_aliexpress_shipping_and_tracking_during_the/), [Tracking status FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aliexpress/comments/kwiw3w/tracking_status_faq/) and [Common scams FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aliexpress/comments/hlk157/common_scams_on_aliexpress_and_how_to_avoid_them/).

za33q5,Aliexpress,11,"Update: i know nobody cares, but i would like to update it here: my graphics card is already installed on my pc for about a month and damn, WHAT A BEAST. The shipping time was 1 month or less, just as expected, to Brazil, things are shipped faster, apparently.",49
za33q5,Aliexpress,12,I had one order that was automatically cancelled and the money was refunded after 1 week when the seller failed to ship the item. I have another order that was supposedly shipped on Nov 27th yet as of Dec 1st there is no tracking showing it was ever picked up by the carrier.,53
za33q5,Aliexpress,13,"In my region, AliExpress shipping takes around a month, so it would be no problem for me, i didn't know China was having corona lockdowns until now, thanks",28
za33q5,Aliexpress,14,After 15 days of no movement on the tracking Aliexpress will automatically cancel.,13
za33q5,Aliexpress,15,Take into consideration that there’s a very complicated situation in china currently and your seller may not be able to ship in the time you need it.,27
za39al,antidepressants,0,Just switched from Pristiq to Fetzima,6
za39al,antidepressants,1,"During the three weeks that I was on Pristiq, my already severe depression and anxiety were worse, and I was having an increased amounts of suicidal thoughts amongst other not being able to sleep, etc. Coming off of 50mg after my doctor took me off it a few days ago whilst waiting for Fetzima to be approved, I've been trying be hopeful that it'll help.",65
za39al,antidepressants,2,"I take my first dose tonight and I'm wondering what your guys' experience with Fetzima for depression, or anxiety, if it helps anxiety. I'd love to actually find an antidepressant that works and doesn't make me feel worse.",38
za39al,antidepressants,3,Curious how your switch went and how you went about it. Thinking about switching to Fetzima myself as Pristiq doesn’t seem like it’s strong enough.,25
za39al,antidepressants,4,"Insurance wouldn't cover Fetzima, but they covered Effexor, which I was on for a month but the negatives of it took away from the good it was doing. I'm on Celexa now and it's working well, side-effects aren't as bad as they were as Effexor, and I'm getting adjusted to it.",51
za39al,antidepressants,5,"To answer your question, I was only on Pristiq for three weeks before the increased depression, anxiety, and paranoia convinced my doctor to take me off of it. That was a nightmare I don't want to relive.",37
za3d3q,toddlers,0,"My 2 year old just got to use a ""free floating"" straw in a big cup to drink some sparkling water for the first time...",25
za3d3q,toddlers,1,"Y'all, what a cutie! The way she reached her neck out like a turtle to find the wiggle straw and get it into her mouth after a little struggle followed by the joy in her eyes after she succeeded and then losing the straw and using her tongue to try to get it back towards her mouth. Just... Lol. So fun to witness. Made my day.",66
za3d3q,toddlers,2,Little moments like this are awesome.,6
za3d3q,toddlers,3,Hope y'all can have one today too :),8
za4b3k,pagan,0,I worship Artemis but I'm interested in also worshiping Aphrodite can I?,12
za4b3k,pagan,1,And how would it work? I know those two do not get along,13
za4b3k,pagan,2,"What makes you think that any two Gods ""do not get along""?",12
za4b3k,pagan,3,What makes you think that you can only worship one God or Goddess at a time?,16
za4b3k,pagan,4,Most people in antiquity would have worshiped both Goddesses without any issues at all.,14
za4b3k,pagan,5,"Myths aren't literal. In fact myths which show on a surface level an antagonism or rivalry between Gods in myths is often interpreted as showing a relationship between the Gods. (eg the Myth of Athena and Poseidon feuding over who gets to be Patron of Athens shows a relationship where both were celebrated at festivals side by side in Athens, as well as being a historical remembrance that Poseidon was likely an important patron of Athens during the days when it had Kings as Poseidon is related to Kingship, and Athena more to democracy.)",94
za4b3k,pagan,6,Look at what Euripides had Heracles say about the myths in the 5th Century BCE.,15
za4b3k,pagan,7,">In any case, I don’t believe any of it. I don’t believe that the gods engage is such unholy relationships, nor have I never believed this story about gods tying up their parents in chains and I won’t believe it now.",41
za4b3k,pagan,8,>Nor can I ever believe that one god is the lord of another.,13
za4b3k,pagan,9,">A god, if he is a real god, is in need of nothing. These are just miserable tales made up by poets.",22
za4b3k,pagan,10,Artemis was historically called on to aid in an easy childbirth. The works of Aphrodite are usually involved in the conception of said children. Why should the two goddesses not get along?,32
za4b3k,pagan,11,"Myths shouldn’t be taken literally, and there’s more to both of these goddesses than the myths.",16
za4b3k,pagan,12,"You can worship any combination of deities that you like. As has already been mentioned, we Hellenists usually don't take myths literally. So there's no need for concern about whether you can worship these two deities together. You can.",39
za4b3k,pagan,13,Considering that the Greeks and Romans worshipped like 15+ gods as whole cultures I don't see why not.,18
za4b3k,pagan,14,"Yeah, they're polytheistic gods so you can worship as many of them as you want to. That's what people have always done.",22
za4b3k,pagan,15,I mean I worship both Odin and Loki in the Norse Parthenon and those two didn't really get along in the end,22
za4b3k,pagan,16,I feel as if 75-90% of goddesses have to do with childbirth.,12
za4y25,Marriage,0,Throwaway. Just need to vent and get some advice.,9
za4y25,Marriage,1,"TLDR; 34m and 34f(me) married 10 years, together 14 years, confused about whether to divorce, whether I'm the problem, and like the title says, just looking to vent and get advice.",31
za4y25,Marriage,2,"(Reading this back after writing and it's so unorganized and chaotic, So sorry to anyone who reads this lol)",19
za4y25,Marriage,3,"I'll start from the beginning, since I think this is where a lot of our issues stem from.",18
za4y25,Marriage,4,"We worked together first, and became friends. He was dating someone at the time, who he'd been with since high school, they had their share of issues, and they broke up. We started dating, and it moved pretty quickly. I was basically living with him at this point, partially because we just enjoyed being together but also I had terrible anxiety and admittedly felt possessive over him. I knew they were still talking. He lied to me about going to see a friend to get him out of a bad situation with his ""alcoholic dad"", went to spend the night with her instead, and he still, to this day, will not tell me the truth. The only reason I know what actually happened is because she told me, and that the friend with the alcoholic dad is a family friend, and he is in fact not an alcoholic.",148
za4y25,Marriage,5,"Very early on I feel like I was pushing him into the next phase of our relationship. Getting our first place together, buying a ring, proposing... all of that I feel like I pushed him to do when maybe he wasn't ready? He did all of it, of course, he didn't have to, I never forced him. But he was never passionate. He went to my parents to ask for their ""permission"" (something we don't believe in now, but we were youngish), but didn't actually do it. Didn't plan a big proposal when he knew I wanted that, Just... didn't put thought into those things. I was fine with that because I thought maybe it just wasn't him, and I accepted him as he was. Looking back now though it does upset me.",133
za4y25,Marriage,6,"There were lots of things that bothered me though. He is very passive, doesn't make decisions, doesn't take initiative, things I didn't think were a big deal so I took the lead on most things in our life. I decided where we lived, our budgets, I took on the ""mental load"". I was fine with it. In the beginning he worked very long hours at a physically challenging job, and even though I was working full time, I was glad to do all of those things.",86
za4y25,Marriage,7,"From very early on, I knew he lacked emotional intimacy. There weren't many emotional conversations. No cuddling just to cuddle. No words of affirmation (or any of the other love languages for that matter lol). Everything was ""fine"" always. DOn't get me wrong. He is a great man. But I'd say, very emotionally immature. Again, it wasn't an issue before because we didn't have any ""real"" responsibilities - car payments, kids, pets, etc. And I didn't need the emotional support, emotional intimacy, communication, etc.",84
za4y25,Marriage,8,"Since we've had kids, we have two (7 and 2), these things are bigger issues for me. Taking on the mental load is more difficult when we have kids and pets. For the longest time, I was doing all the cleaning, planning, cooking, etc. Then he started a different job that was way less hours, not physically demanding, and he could be home more. He didn't pick up any slack or chores or anything. We talked, he reluctantly agreed to start doing more around the house. Which is great, I'm thankful. BUT, I still have to initiate the tasks most of the time, unless it effects him directly (like laundry). We tried the Fair Play game, that helped a bit, but again, I felt like I was forcing him to participate. Dragging him along. With the kids, I'm the one planning and executing outings, and then I have to drag him out to come with us.",156
za4y25,Marriage,9,"I have no emotional support when it comes to the kids. I am the one that makes rules, bedtimes, pushes showers and teeth brushing. Makes appointments. Remembers vaccines, clothing sizes... When something goes wrong, he turns it around on me and it's my fault. But then I feel set up because he won't make decisions or help out, so of course it's my fault because he doesn't do anything. He won't apologize. Ever. At all. He wrestles with our oldest and doesn't stop when he asks. Doesn't apologize if oldest is hurt. Is just cruel sometimes with us.He claims our son lies about things, stupid things, and then doesn't apologize when he's proven wrong. He does not praise or acknowledge good work from the kids or me. It's like he only has negative thoughts, assumes the worst, etc. Doesn't thank anyone. I can't disagree with him at all.",148
za4y25,Marriage,10,"His biggest gripe is that we aren't physically intimate enough. Anytime I try to talk about our issues, the issues I have, he says he would be happier, more active in our lives, if we had more sx.",38
za4y25,Marriage,11,"For a long time after our marriage, I thought I was asexual. I had no desire or urge at all. But I'm learning that all of these things that I thought didn't matter, that I ignored, actually do matter to me. And they push me away from him. I don't feel respected. I don't feel loved (I asked him during our last serious conversation whether he still loved me. He said he ""tries to love"" me. etc?). I don't feel appreciated. I'm learning that I can't force myself to be physical in a relationship that doesn't have those things. Yes, I've communicated all of this with him. He said he didn't know how, or what to do, or that he was already giving his all. I take 100% of the responsibility on this. I don't want him to be in a relationship that the's not fulfilled in, and it is 100% my fault that we aren't sexual. I knew all of these things were issues before we were married, and I ignored them. That's on me.",176
za4y25,Marriage,12,"At the same time though, I keep hearing ""If he wanted to, he would."" If he loved me, cared for me, appreciated me, he would be making an effort.",29
za4y25,Marriage,13,There is no effort.,4
za4y25,Marriage,14,"I know I am also at fault in this relationship situation. Don't get me wrong. I have ADHD, Anxiety, depression, I'm terrible at managing money and budgets. I have my own issues. But I do try. So hard. I'm in therapy. I'm on meds. I'm really trying.",47
za4y25,Marriage,15,"But I'm fucking exhausted of feeling like I'm the only one trying here. If all of these red flags that I ignored 14 years ago still exist, I can't expect him to change to become what I need.",38
za4y25,Marriage,16,"But, we have kids. I still have hope that things will get better.",13
za4y25,Marriage,17,But they haven't got better. Am I the shitty one here? Can I just get some input? Validation? Or slap me with some reality? Being an adult really fucking sucks.,30
za4y25,Marriage,18,My thoughts are.,3
za4y25,Marriage,19,"His ex might have been the love of his life fantasy type of thing. He essentially was dating you and slept with his ex, possibly in hopes of something becoming more again. Not nice. But you need to let go of the past and it was 14 years ago. He does seem to have a lot of issues though.",59
za4y25,Marriage,20,Sounds like he's not feeling it and neither are you. It's unlikely he will change and it's unlikely you will want to jump into bed with him. Does that mean divorce? Probably not.,33
za4y25,Marriage,21,"I think you need some self-care outside of this constellation. Pick up some hobbies, concentrate on that. You need to stop caring so much, analysing and picking up the slack, He complains about you doing too much, not enough, not perfect enough, it needs to go over your head and he needs to step up and you slow down.",59
za4y25,Marriage,22,"He will likely not change. He seems really reactive and that's probably the turn off for you sexually, it's not that you're asexual, it's that you're not connected.",28
za4y25,Marriage,23,So here's what you do:,5
za4y25,Marriage,24,"Since he's reactive maybe just love him for who he is and accept him. Warts and all. If you can manage that, great! If you can't, you need to learn this for yourself.",33
za4y25,Marriage,25,"Sex can only come with connection. He has hobbies? Let him carry them out, leave him be. If he wants to hang out with you, ok, watch his movies, eat the foods he likes. Find his jokes funny again. If not, the grown man has friends and you go live his life.",52
za4y25,Marriage,26,"But there's no give without take. He needs to do more things he's good at, maybe cleaning, maybe task, without you telling him to. You need to take whatever you feel you need.",33
za4y25,Marriage,27,"You can do loads to build a connection without giving in to sex. Sex will come with a decent connection and once it feel natural again, things will start on a better foot than now.",35
za4y25,Marriage,28,Sounds like you guys need marriage counseling asap. Good luck 🍀,11
za599y,TTC_PCOS,0,Anyone else starting letrozole this cycle?,6
za599y,TTC_PCOS,1,I’ll be starting it in roughly 16 days and would love a cycle buddy 😅 I’m so nervous and hopeful!,20
za599y,TTC_PCOS,2,Any tips or tricks are appreciated!,6
za599y,TTC_PCOS,3,"I will be starting it as soon as I get my period (CD 3-7), which should be any day now! Fingers crossed for you too!",25
za599y,TTC_PCOS,4,"Starting second round tonight! Last month I found the side effects are fine, little bit dizzy, but the impact of the progesterone after ovulation if you’re not used to it is WILD. Hot sweats for DAYS.",36
za599y,TTC_PCOS,5,I’m hopefully starting it Saturday after baseline ultrasound/labs! 🤞,9
za599y,TTC_PCOS,6,In the TWW on my first round!,7
za599y,TTC_PCOS,7,I’m 5 days post my last dose of my first round x,12
za599y,TTC_PCOS,8,I’m starting it in roughly 2 weeks too! Cycle twins!,10
za599y,TTC_PCOS,9,"I am! I’ll be starting my second round, I didn’t ovulate on my first round of 2.5mg so they’ve upped the dosage to 5mg for next cycle. I’m just waiting to get my period now. Good luck to you!!",39
za599y,TTC_PCOS,10,Me!! On day 3 of Provera right now to induce a period.,12
za599y,TTC_PCOS,11,I am on my 2nd round of IUI with donor sperm (31F lesbian) and was on 2.5mg of letrazole last month.,21
za599y,TTC_PCOS,12,I’m doing IUI again and taking 2.5 letrazole every night this week and then hopefully doing my trigger shot (ovidrel) if I get a mature follicle next week!,28
za599y,TTC_PCOS,13,I’m on my second cycle now! Had a 22mm follicle and took the trigger on Wednesday. Fingers crossed 🤞🏽🤞🏽,19
za599y,TTC_PCOS,14,It’s a really easy process just make sure to document every single symptom you get. I believe a lot of my side affects I was taking as pregnancy symptoms and convinced myself I was pregnant and was crushed after round 1.,41
za599y,TTC_PCOS,15,I started tonight for my first round with it!,9
za599y,TTC_PCOS,16,Starting my first round hopefully in the next week or so (waiting for AF to show up after a round of provera). Here’s hoping things go smoothly for all of us!!,31
za599y,TTC_PCOS,17,I was supposed to but my clinic didn’t send my prescription in time! 😭,14
za599y,TTC_PCOS,18,Me! This is my last day taking it. It’s been good except for a little bit of digestive upset.,19

za599y,TTC_PCOS,20,Started letrozole today!I go in on Saturday to get my follicles checked.,12
za599y,TTC_PCOS,21,Having the worst period migraine since yesterday. Once I took letrozole I had a nap and now feeling much better,20
za599y,TTC_PCOS,22,Finished my Letrozole on Tuesday. I have a ultrasound tomorrow to see follicle size,14
za599y,TTC_PCOS,23,Starting a new round soon with increased dose. Also doing some testing since RE is concerned that my luteal phase is too long.,23
za599y,TTC_PCOS,24,"Second cycle! First cycle 5 days of 5mg, failed to produce a mature follicle, took three additional days and didn’t progress at all so the cycle was cancelled. On my third day at 7.5, hoping and praying it succeeds.",39
za599y,TTC_PCOS,25,I started taking it from day 8. Im really worried if that's okay. My doctor she just told me to start it. Didn't tell me that it should be taken from day 3.,33
za599y,TTC_PCOS,26,Good luck!!! I’m sending lots of baby dust,8
za599y,TTC_PCOS,27,I’m in the same exact boat! Last day of provera tomorrow. Fingers crossed. COVID messed with my last medicated cycle so hopefully this one works!!,25
za599y,TTC_PCOS,28,I’m so so interested to see how it impacts me. Thank you for this!,14
za599y,TTC_PCOS,29,That’s so exciting! Crossing fingers for you,7
za599y,TTC_PCOS,30,I felt sick on day 3 and quite unwell but then got better and have just felt hotter,18
za599y,TTC_PCOS,31,How did you feel from it?,6
za599y,TTC_PCOS,32,Ahhhhh yay! I hope it’s a successful round for you guys,11
za599y,TTC_PCOS,33,Good luck!! I hope it all works out,8
za599y,TTC_PCOS,34,I’m on roughly the same schedule! Trigger shot Monday and mildly panicking now because the tww is just the worst.,20
za599y,TTC_PCOS,35,"I’m starting my first night tomorrow, first round, cycle buddy :)",11
za599y,TTC_PCOS,36,Noooooo! I’m so sorry 😞,5
za599y,TTC_PCOS,37,Fingers crossed for you!,4
za599y,TTC_PCOS,38,How long is the LP for you? I’m having similar concerns,11
za599y,TTC_PCOS,39,Thank you! ☺️❤️,3
za599y,TTC_PCOS,40,Thank you! I hope it works for you as well!,10
za599y,TTC_PCOS,41,Yes - I have cried several times today imagine myself holding a negative test. I can take it but gotta give myself something to look forward to.,27
za599y,TTC_PCOS,42,I’m literally working right now to keep my mind off of it 😭😭,13
za599y,TTC_PCOS,43,How are you feeling about it?? I get such anxiety when I start a new med lol,17
za599y,TTC_PCOS,44,Like 16-18 days I think. She said could be a sign of very early loss (I’m not as sure since I’ve been taking pregnancy tests tho?). She said it should be 14 days between the positive OPK and the new cycle,41
za599y,TTC_PCOS,45,feel free to message if you need to rant/could use support! seems like our timelines are pretty similar :) my CD1 is expected in the next week-10 days,28
za599y,TTC_PCOS,46,Feeling cautiously optimistic. I’m sure my mind will spiral soon enough though. I was frustrated and down cause I thought provera didn’t even work to give me a period to start this cycle. Never been so happy to see my period. Just want to get things started really - sick of not even ovulating and being able to try,59
za599y,TTC_PCOS,47,i’m with you on this! i feel like i haven’t even had a shot at trying yet. but i’m also worried about all the stress of then ‘actually’ ttc. i think i’ll be needing provera to start mine so i can then start the medicated cycle process. good luck to you!,51
za599y,TTC_PCOS,48,"I know, it’s going to be a real lesson in patience. Waiting for (hopefully) ovulation, then the tww, then provera again, repeat. I’m hoping doing some yoga helps my stress.",30
za599y,TTC_PCOS,49,i agree! for sure have been trying to find what helps me manage stress and obsessive thoughts 😅,18

za5cla,migraine,3,If you don't like it wean off as soon as possible. It's hands down the worst withdrawal I've ever gone through. Worse than benzos withdrawal. I was on 900mg 3x day for about six months. Near the end I thought I was losing my mind. The brain fog was so intense and my vision was awful.,56
za5cla,migraine,4,"100 mg 2x day chilled me out and helped some with blurry vision. 200 mg 2x day knocked me out with exhaustion. I gained ~5 lbs in the 3 months I was on gaba, and my face was puffy as well. I stopped taking it because it made my tits hurt so fucking bad hahaha. Looked it up and in like 1% of people it causes severe breast pain. Of course I was in the 1%. Overall, even if it only helped my auras a little, I loved gaba for my anxiety.",92
za5cla,migraine,5,Those are known side effects.,5
za5cla,migraine,6,"They gave me 300 mg and it knocked me out. Then, 100 mg which didn’t do anything.",17
za5cla,migraine,7,Omg is that why my face is puffy? Did it go away for y'all?,14
za5cla,migraine,8,"I'm on gaba... Made me ""stupid"" in the begining. But your body adjusts. Weight gain can be a side effect. Not sure about the puffy face tho. Give Dr a call maybe. The withdrawals from it aren't fun... I've done it twice .. but it's better than say Lyrica. If you can try to give the med a chance otherwise move onto the next option.",65
za5cla,migraine,9,"Yup, crap medicine for migraine. A GP put me on it for a while until I complained it did not help and made me feel awful. That and Topamax should not be prescribed for migraine, ever, in my opinion, but what do I know :/",45
za5cla,migraine,10,Exactly what happened to me. Took it once and never again. Dr listed it as one of my allergies,19
za5cla,migraine,11,Ooh that might be why my tits hurt too lol,10
za5cla,migraine,12,"That's interesting but makes sense. I have known a few people over the years that took it for fun, which I think is crazy on many levels. I never thought about it being an allergy.",35
za5cla,migraine,13,Basically just means they won’t ever prescribe it again and it will alert them in the system,17
za5r4a,disability,0,Does anyone know how to train your own pet to be a service dog?,14
za5r4a,disability,1,I wanted to have a Service Dog for my heart rate since I tend to forget bodily pain (?) and tend to pass out and have no one around me at most times,33
za5r4a,disability,2,"The first step is to have the pet dog you're wanting to train evaluated by a canine behavioralist or a professional trainer who's experienced in service dog training to see if they have potential as a candidate. It is much more likely for a dog to not have the right temperament for service work than it is for them to be suited for it, and because training is so incredibly expensive and takes so long (usually around 2 years), you don't want to be starting out with a prospect that has no chance of succeeding. That's why it's important to get an evaluation first, before you start investing time and money into training.",113
za5r4a,disability,3,"If this current dog is a suitable prospect, the next step would be to get set up with a trainer who can help you through the process.",27
za5r4a,disability,4,"If this current dog is not a suitable prospect, whether that's because of temperament, behavioral habits, age, etc, the next step would be to acquire a new prospect and to potentially figure out a rehoming option for your current dog if owning two dogs at once isn't possible for you.",50
za5r4a,disability,5,"Something else to keep in mind is that if you're looking for a dog to be a cardiac alert service dog, your best bet is to get a service dog from a program as opposed to owner training one. Cardiac alerts are currently not thought to be a type of alert that can be trained and instead require a natural ability from the dog. If cardiac alert is a task that you need a service dog to perform, getting a program dog is a much safer bet because then you know that dog will be able to do that task as opposed to rolling the dice and hoping the dog you attempt to owner train ends up able to do it.",121
za5r4a,disability,6,"Well, I can tell you this: it's allowed. There's no rule about who can and can't train a service animal, no certifications or licenses involved. And, there's no tests or anything for an animal you've trained to count.",38
za5r4a,disability,7,"However, consider your position: you're asking Reddit how to train a dog to do something with your life in the balance. That screams ""bad idea.""",25
za5r4a,disability,8,"If you want to do this, first you have to train yourself to learn how to train dogs, and familiarize yourself with the process of training a service animal, and then re-visit this.",33
za5r4a,disability,9,"Until then, I'd suggest a medical alert system with fall detection as a stopgap",14
za5r4a,disability,10,"I have experience with service dogs and ""service dog trainers."" The rules regarding service dogs are extremely flexible (too much so; bad people often take advantage of them)",28
za5r4a,disability,11,"My advice based on my experience: work with a dog that has a very good bond with you. The closer you are to him/her, the more likely that he/she will be in-tune with your body",35
za5r4a,disability,12,You don't have to formally train a dog for him/her to be aware of your body.,16
za5r4a,disability,13,"If you're in an emergency state- that dog will *take care of you,* instinctively",14
za5r4a,disability,14,"While training with a professional trainer isn’t required, you do still have to train a dog to do tasks. The vast majority of dogs aren’t just going to instinctively do task work simply because they have a bond with their owner like your saying they will.",46
za5r4a,disability,15,"And even if a dog does happen to have a natural alert or response, it doesn’t legally count as a task unless that natural alert/response is then shaped and reinforced as the ADA specifically states it has to be trained.",40
za5r4a,disability,16,"""the vast majority of dogs aren't just going to instinctively do task work"" - this particular person mentioned that they pass out. Not every dog would respond well to task work like ""press emergency button,"" but any dog would start barking its head off at the sight of its owner passed out on the ground",55
za5r4a,disability,17,"I guess I was trying to think more flexibly like ""how can a person own a dog that can help save their life - without having to 'train it' according to ADA standards""",33
za5r4a,disability,18,"No actually the majority of dogs won’t do that either. They may be slightly concerned or scared at first and then ignore/move away from their owner or even attempt to initiate play, but barking isn’t something a lot dogs will do in that situation. Especially not with the actual purpose of getting attention.",53
za5r4a,disability,19,"That type of thing must either be shaped or trained. And OP was specifically asking about having their pet dog become a service dog, which would need to meet the ADA definition and requirements to be a service dog. If it isn’t trained to that then it isn’t a service dog.",51
za5r4a,disability,20,Ugh whatever I still have my viewpoint based on my experience and you have yours. Have a good one,19
za5r4a,disability,21,Literally - tasks must be trained in order to count. Full stop. A bond and 'natural reactions' do not meet the legal definition of a service dog.,27
za5r4a,disability,22,"I ""know* the tasks are required so a dog can legally be considered a service animal",16
za5r4a,disability,23,"But in my experience, dog trainers often don't understand the disabled person's needs (and therefore they don't understand the tasks that they need to train the dog)",27
za5r4a,disability,24,"Personally, I don't think we need to train complicated tasks because when we develop strong bonds with animals, they can sense when we're in a medical emergency",27
za5r4a,disability,25,It's ok to disagree. Lol,5
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,0,Concerned my girlfriend may have a shopping addiction,8
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,1,My girlfriend (22) has been living with my family and I for almost a year. I am beginning to suspect she has a shopping addiction.,25
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,2,"She currently has a couple thousand dollars in credit card debt and has taken out about $9k in several personal loans (with sky high interest, which she has used to pay off her past credit card debt). She also has been maxing out her student loans every semester to pay on her credit cards. (To make matters worse, she isn’t doing very well grade-wise but refuses to change her major to something more suited to her) She goes on large shopping sprees every couple weeks buying makeup, clothes and shoes. Our bedroom is overflowing with all her purchases, a lot of which she only wears a couple times.",108
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,3,She doesn’t have the greatest job either and only works part-time. She also bought a brand new vehicle for $25k on which the payment and insurance eats up over half of her income.,33
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,4,"I love her but I’m finding it hard to wrap my head around what she does. I’m concerned that we will never be able to get a place of our own due to her debt-to-income ratio, let alone be able to one day buy a house.",46
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,5,"Am I overreacting? If not, is there anything I can do to support her and help her see that this isn’t sustainable?",22
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,6,"You don't even have your own place, she's blowing money, and taking out loans with high interest???",17
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,7,"Ruh oh! You need to talk to her and set your priorities...if you live with family you do everything you can to be independent and I've been there. I don't like having to rely on anyone else, ever.",38
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,8,"Also, don't do anything stupid before you get this sorted. If she's not willing to adapt I guess is the word I'll use this may be a problem you have to live with for the rest of your life, unless divorce.",41
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,9,"Certainly tell her how this is affecting you. Sometimes people don't realize there is a problem until they are told. See if you can help her come up with a plan to get back on track and get to a better financial state. Being in college is hard, and it looks like she may not have developed the skills to manage money prior to college. A lot of people (including myself) have been there. Try not to demean her or talk down to her -- the world is set up in a way that is designed to make people like her continue what she is doing, in order to maximize profit off of her.",114
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,10,"Remember that it is a gradual process -- you won't see progress overnight. She might have to take the time to see a therapist, if there is something that she is trying to compensate for.",35
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,11,"But remember first and foremost, that she has to be willing to help herself. If you express how you feel and she doesn't seem to take it seriously, use that information for your next move.",35
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,12,"All good advice here, I just wanted to add when you do approach her don’t do so from an accusatory place. It sounds like she’s dealing with a lot mentally (addiction is all about filling a void), and she may see it as an attack and crawl deeper into the hole. Be firm but gentle, and show her how you can help her too",64
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,13,"If she has a shopping addiction, she may need therapy to address the issues, as for some they get a high from shopping, or it helps ease stress. On top of that she is young, and might not have received proper financial guidance earlier on in her life.",48
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,14,"Your concerns are valid and I suggest you present them to her in the kindest way possible, that you are worried for her and your future together.",27
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,15,"Even too, what is her social media usage like? Is she being easily swayed by influencers?",16

If I knew then what I know now I'd have run for the hills 2 months in. If I met a young woman who was in the same situation I was in I'd tell her to leave and never look back.

za79i9,AmItheAsshole,41,"NTA, though I'm kinda curious about this part. They woke up to the TV being gone, and then they just calmly asked you about it when you woke up? Because it seems like if they weren't *flipping the fuck out* that an expensive TV went missing from their own home overnight, you kinda proved yourself right in that they really don't give a shit.",64
za79i9,AmItheAsshole,42,"NTA, your roommates REALLY don't seem to take security seriously. Don't let them coerce you into moving the tv back out and definitely move out the second you can.",29
za79i9,AmItheAsshole,43,"NTA And it's not just the security of your property, but your safety compromised at night as well.",18
za79i9,AmItheAsshole,44,"Used to live in a situation like that except my roommates at the time kept inviting a ton of strangers over without anyone else home. We had some expensive equipment in there and like OP, couldn't afford to replace it. Got to the point we started asking for spare keys back and only those whose names were on the lease could hold a key.",64
za79i9,AmItheAsshole,45,So totally NTA. You stuck to your boundaries and now they know you mean business hopefully. I wish you luck with the rest of your lease 🙏,27

za79i9,AmItheAsshole,48,"So I (19f) live in a small apartment complex. My roommates (m&f) have a habit of leaving the front door of our apartment unlocked and unattended. I've mentioned many times it makes me uncomfortable unless someone is in the common area hanging out or something. If they're in the common area, I don't care.",54
za79i9,AmItheAsshole,49,"My TV is out there for everyone to use. But with the door being unlocked, I have felt unsafe with it since I can't afford to replace it. The door being unlocked has happened so many times, and I finally told them that if it keeps happening, I'm going to have to move my TV into my room to have my own peace of mind.",65
za79i9,AmItheAsshole,50,"Since I told them that, it happened a good couple more times and I kept thinking to myself ""you know, it's daytime, they're getting used to it, one more chance,"" and I'd just locked the door and carry on.",39
za79i9,AmItheAsshole,51,"The issue came when last night, everyone was in there rooms, I couldn't sleep. I got up around 4am to go get water. I walk into the living room (no one in it), and the door is unlocked. It was 4am. Way different then daytime. And that was my last straw. I immediately moved the TV into my room and didn't say anything.",63
za79i9,AmItheAsshole,52,"When asked the next day, I said ""oh the door was unlocked at 4am and no one was in here, so I felt safer with it in my room from now on."" And there was some arguing saying it wasn't when I know it was, because I locked it afterwards, and then silent treatment.",54
za79i9,AmItheAsshole,53,"And I feel guilty because I don't want them to hate me, but I couldn't keep having my boundaries disrespected, as I've respected all of their's, and I don't feel safe having it at risk anymore. I feel like it was my right, and it's not even to punish anyone, it's just to protect my thing that I worked hard to purchase.",62

za79i9,AmItheAsshole,59,"NTA. Why was YOUR tv in the common room anyway? You were sharing an expensive electronic, asking for no compensation in return, and only making one stipulation: that they treat the tv with the same care and security they would if they bought it themselves by locking the door so no one stole it. They couldn’t handle the one (super easy) rule, even after being reminded multiple times, so they lost the privilege of watching a tv they didn’t pay for. F*ck around, find out",85

za7z94,Screenwriting,0,High Concept Low Budget Genre,5
za7z94,Screenwriting,1,This is the first time I’ve posted here. Please be gentle guys.,12
za7z94,Screenwriting,2,"I’ve been writing scripts here and there for years but never had any luck selling them. So I decided to narrow my focus and write something that would be easier to film. No car chases or creature effects. Also I personally love high concept, cerebral ideas so I decided to write a High Concept Low Budget horror screenplay…",58
za7z94,Screenwriting,3,And it worked! I sold it and it’s In post production now. I think I want to keep writing in this format and see if I can do it again. Kinda make it my thing.,35
za7z94,Screenwriting,4,I’m hoping to hear from other writers about if they tailor their writing to fit into a certain style or if they hope to make a name for themselves by writing a screenplays of only types.,36
za7z94,Screenwriting,5,"Also any other writers who write similar screenplays, what have been your experiences. Did it make it easier to sell for you?",22
za7z94,Screenwriting,6,Congrats to you!,3
za7z94,Screenwriting,7,"I don't really do the Hollywood thing anymore. Did that back in the 80s and 90s. These days, at my age, I love writing simple, character-driven low budget movies for independent producers. The pay is not great, certainly not by Hollywood standards, but the movies get made. A movie I wrote last year is in post now. I can't wait to see it.",63
za7z94,Screenwriting,8,Sounds like you got a good plan working for you. Wishing you continued success.,14
za7z94,Screenwriting,9,That’s basically the Blumhouse model. Jason has wondered out loud why others aren’t adopting it.,15
za7z94,Screenwriting,10,"I also wrote a high concept, low budget banger with the intention of attracting a producer. And that script is out with an A-list production company off a cold query.",30
za7z94,Screenwriting,11,"Right now I’m working on a comedy pilot that, after looking at the pitch deck, said he “can’t think of a more complicated comedy” but that “the script could be great.” Another producer read the script and said it was “hilarious and like It’s Always Sunny meets Half Baked” so the complexity of it seems to range.",57
za7z94,Screenwriting,12,But writing something simple yet fucking bonkers is so fun and uninhabiting.,12
za7z94,Screenwriting,13,Congrats on selling the script! I can’t wait to see a post when it finally comes out!,17
za7z94,Screenwriting,14,Congrats on getting your script sold and into production. That's huge. However...,12
za7z94,Screenwriting,15,&#x200B;,1
za7z94,Screenwriting,16,>I think I want to keep writing in this format and see if I can do it again. Kinda make it my thing.,23
za7z94,Screenwriting,17,Think about the economics of that and figure out if it's sustainable. How long did it take to write the script? How much did you get paid for it? How many would you need to write in a year (and sell) to quit your day job?,46
za7z94,Screenwriting,18,"Solid high-concept low-budget scripts are more difficult to write than if you had no budgetary restrictions. Ironically, the compensation for the added difficulty is diametrically lowered, since the film budget is limited.",32
za7z94,Screenwriting,19,I'm not saying don't do it again. We all need to have realistic producible work in our portfolio. But do not limit yourself.,23
za7z94,Screenwriting,20,Good luck.,2
za7z94,Screenwriting,21,And again - congrats.,4
za7z94,Screenwriting,22,Post the script or at least a log line you fucking tease,12
za7z94,Screenwriting,23,I love writing low budget stuff.,6
za7z94,Screenwriting,24,"For me it was an obvious move. Would I give a first timer millions for anything? No. So if you write something people are will to risk some cash on (low budget), you have a better chance.",37
za7z94,Screenwriting,25,Can I ask what you mean by high concept cerebral ideas because that sounds almost like an oxymoron to me.,20
za7z94,Screenwriting,26,"Did you still get a decent payday? I'm scared that if I'm *too* budget-friendly, I'll only harm my potential earnings.",20
za7z94,Screenwriting,27,that's awesome congratulations!!,3
za7z94,Screenwriting,28,"did you have to change anything from the original script? & also, could you had been part of the assisting directing if you requested possibly? given that it was your vision and message its only right but since they paid i doubt it right?",44
za7z94,Screenwriting,29,Congrats!,1
za7z94,Screenwriting,30,I have a thriller/horror that has less than ten characters and takes place over one night at a ranch. A friend who read a draft said it’s almost like a play and there are a few things that may be a bit effect heavy like a fire and cattle being wrangled.,51
za7z94,Screenwriting,31,The plot is weird and my other main script is a high budget Vietnam war thriller involving psychedelic shit so my ranch script is certainly a lot smaller.,28
za7z94,Screenwriting,32,Congrats! What is your story about?,6
za7z94,Screenwriting,33,if it's your passion then every dollar is well worth it bud. if you don't mind me asking what are the numbers like when selling for a low budget film,30
za7z94,Screenwriting,34,A real 10 grand is worth a lot more than an imaginary 10 million,14
za7z94,Screenwriting,35,"Unlike Hollywood where writer rates are dictated by the Writers Guild, low budget independent prices depend on what you're willing to work for - and what you can get. Five grand, ten grand, twenty grand. Whatever. It just depends. Sometimes you work cheap in the hopes the movie will take off and take you with it.",56
za7z94,Screenwriting,36,"One director asked me if he could shoot one of my horror screenplays in exchange for part of the profits (if any and there won't be. LOL!). I said, sure. The script was just sitting in a box anyway. We'll hammer out a deal and I'll let him shoot it. Another produced movie on my resume.",56
za7z94,Screenwriting,37,Hope that helps.,3
za7z94,Screenwriting,38,That's very true. I was more talking low-budget vs. ultra low budget. I'll write a horror movie for 10k. Not gonna write one for $300 or something.,27
za7z94,Screenwriting,39,>One director asked me if he could shoot one of my horror screenplays in exchange for part of the profits,20
unknown,unknown,0,wonderfully said thank you.,4
unknown,unknown,1,"Oh. I mean I’d argue that a produced script is worth some of the trade off, but not that low, obvs",21
unknown,unknown,2,Awesome! Thanks!,2
za9cjk,Fosterparents,0,Submitted our application today. Excited and nervous.,7
za9cjk,Fosterparents,1,"My wife works in a local elementary school and has worked with a boy for the last 2 years who has been in the system since birth, in and out of foster homes, family homes etc..The kid has had no stable place to stay and lives out of a suitcase. After 2 years of working with him daily, my wife asked if he could live with us, she said he is a sweet kid who needs a stable, loving home and we can provide that.",85
za9cjk,Fosterparents,2,"My concern is that the kid has averaged 6 homes a year and we don’t know why. My wife and the schools have seen no signs of anything serious, no violence or trauma, he is well adjusted, happy and gets along with everyone. Is this normal? Is 30 plus homes unusual? Is the system that broken? Or should I be really wary? I have no context to help me understand this number of homes.",74
za9cjk,Fosterparents,3,I would expect him to show some challenges related to attachment and trust if he's been in that many times. It will take a long time for him to let his guard down.,33
za9cjk,Fosterparents,4,"A home environment can be very challenging for some students; school is structured and predictable, and serious trauma very rarely happens in a school.",24
za9cjk,Fosterparents,5,"The fact that your wife already has a solid relationship with him should be a really big help. Many stories from foster care where children do well start this way. Of course, he has significant trauma and is likely not as ""well-adjusted"" under the surface as he seems. You may want to read about trauma; ""What Happened to You"" by Dr. Bruce Perry and Oprah is a fairly easy read and a great introduction.",74
za9cjk,Fosterparents,6,That doesn't mean that you won't have a rewarding experience.,10
za9cjk,Fosterparents,7,The system is that broken. I have literal infants that average six homes. INFANTS. I have teens who have had hundreds of placements. And kids who have no placement go into what is called temporary placements where they literally are moved every week if not every day - the commitments are only for a day at a time. Sounds like he has been in that a few times.,68
za9cjk,Fosterparents,8,"All children in foster care have trauma behaviors, and every move worsens them. We recruit too many untrained foster families. A child being harmed is never the fault of the child. Foster care often harms the children more than the original bio family due to the nature of trauma and its affect on the brain.",55
za9cjk,Fosterparents,9,"I will be honest, the amount of homes is going to have caused a lot of pain and damage, but **it isn't his fault.** I'm sure many were also abusive emotionally (even if unintentional - many people use traditional parenting methods of punishment not understanding it is harmful and abusive to traumatized kids), just due to the statistical odds, and caused his pain to deepen. I could take a perfect super child, from the best family in the world, and if you put that child through what that foster child has been through, they would act the same way. Heck, if I took an adult, they would act the same way (if not worse).",114
za9cjk,Fosterparents,10,"It is going to be a hard journey (but if you have the right mindset, amazing, because you're helping an abused child and growing as a person yourself to be more patient, loving, empathetic, and strong) and you're going to have to dedicate yourself to learning and studying trauma and parenting traumatized kids. As long as you take the time to really learn and research, it is going to be one of the best things you have chosen to do in your life (although sometimes you may regret it and want to jump out the window - but that is just being a parent in general). The child you see in school is the child he is deep down, but there are going to be huge scary trauma behaviors that arise once he is placed in your home to test you and see if you will disrupt. These kids will do everything they can to try to push you away. If you prepare for it and dedicate yourself to **committing**, then you'll live and come out stronger for it, and it will save his literal physical and neurological development in ways that are profound.",194
za9cjk,Fosterparents,11,"I recommend reading some books. In fact, a lot of books. The more you read, the better off you'll be. There are also some great on demand DVDs by Karyn Purvis regarding TBRI. I find these to be incredible.",39
za9cjk,Fosterparents,12,"Be wary of Reddit and social media groups. Always remember that the type people who failed him initially are also members, and even though well-intended, do not have the skillset to heal but often end up profoundly breaking these kids.",40
za9cjk,Fosterparents,13,"Get therapy for yourself and for him right away. If you need a good virtual group with trainings, PM me.",20
za9cjk,Fosterparents,14,"And although I'm not too religious, God bless you for doing this for him. You do not understand the impact you can have. It is so profound.",27
za9cjk,Fosterparents,15,Thank you for stepping up for this child. 30 homes? That's atrocious and not normal. Definitely have a frank talk about this with the social worker. It may not be the child's fault at all but it's definitely something to carefully discuss.,42
za9cjk,Fosterparents,16,"Thank you. I ordered the book. I know it will take time and gentle persistence to gain his trust, and I’m quiet and patient. It will come in time, I’m sure. It just has to be earned honestly.",38
za9cjk,Fosterparents,17,"Thank you. I completely understand that the kid is blameless, and that a load of bad decisions by adults in his life have brought him here. I know we have a job ahead of us, but like anything worth doing, it’s worth doing it right. This isn’t about us, it’s about him.",52
za9cjk,Fosterparents,18,"I love Dr. Bruce Perry. His other book is very good too, ""The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog.""",20
za9cjk,Fosterparents,19,"I would read Dr. Perry's books before reading, ""The Body Keeps The Score"" which is also commonly recommended and is going to come up to you at some point. They're very similar books and the two authors worked in the same labs, but one is aimed at adults and the other is aimed at kids. Read ""The Body Keeps The Score"" after.",62
za9cjk,Fosterparents,20,Other book suggestions:,3

za9cjk,Fosterparents,27,"I also recommend watching the plethora of movies, documentaries, and television series about adoption and foster care. They're so many good ones.",22
za9cjk,Fosterparents,28,"As long as you dedicate yourself to never giving up, then the battle is won. My advice too is to keep the bar extremely low. If he manages to walk in the house, consider that a win. If he says hello, act like it is a miracle that he has such social skills. If he knows how to potty - again, huge win!",63
za9cjk,Fosterparents,29,"If you want a great movie, I've always loved Instant Family as a general introduction. There are a lot of great documentaries and movies out there in addition to books.",30
za9cjk,Fosterparents,30,Which is his BKTS version?,5
za9cjk,Fosterparents,31,"""The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog"". ""What Happened To You"" is very good as well.",17

za9rlq,relationship_advice,1,"The past few months my (23F) boyfriend (25 M) of over 2 years has been my rock. I recently lost my grandfather to cancer and my parents went to go take care of our family in Israel. In doing that they left me to take care of my two younger sisters, the house, and our 4 pets (3 dogs and 1 cat) for a month and a half. On top of that I’m a full time student that babysits and dog-sits on the side. My boyfriend has been trying to take off as much of the responsibility as possible so that I can still do my school work and pass my classes.

zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,0,Sad about my master's graduation,5
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,1,I (30f) am graduating next week from my Master's program for my dream career. I've been working hard since 2019 in this program and I've done well even when switching to remote learning due to the pandemic.,37
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,2,My fiance (30m) currently lives 6 hours away for his doctoral program that he's dreamed of ever since I met him 11 years ago. He unfortunately will not be able to attend because he has final exams the next day. I completely understand and I don't want him to do poorly on his final exams especially since he expressed concern that he hasn't been performing to his standards and may risk some need for remediation. I truly do not want him to risk his performance for his exam to travel to me for graduation and so forth. We both discussed that it is in both of our interests that he stay at school to prepare for his exams.,118
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,3,"As the days come closer and closer to graduation, I become more sad that he won't be there to share this monumental ceremony experience with me. I am saddened because he's been with me for the last 11 years, proposed to me this year, and he's been there supporting me throughout my entire undergraduate and graduate career. I want to share this special moment with him and celebrate with him. I've done the same for him as he also started his doctoral program this year and supported him throughout. I'm extremely proud of him and want him to excel and exceed in his program.",104
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,4,"He has expressed feeling guilty of not being able to make it. I've told him time and time again that though he may feel guilty, it's okay. Because even though I lie about being sad momentarily when I think about him not being there, I truthfully tell him that I am extremely happy he's in his dream program and that he will have the career he's been working so hard for for the past 11 years. I truly don't want him to feel guilty because I sort of do think him not coming is an investment for his program to pass, not remediate, and get that degree. I was reminded throughout my master's program that committing to it and making sure I graduate costs us a short term sacrifice of not always being able to be there for your loved ones or for personal enjoyment, for long term payout (hopefully).",150
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,5,"I do plan on spending much much more time with him after I graduate and travel with my family internationally for the holidays (he is not joining due to the 14 hour flights to and from, 16 hour time difference, and about only a 1.5-2 week break). So the distance is not an issue, it's just that I'm sad he won't be at graduation. Plus, I will be his study buddy again once I'm back since I have to study for board exams.",83
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,6,"I think the sadness just revolves around wanting to have my person be there with me to see me graduate. To take pictures for memories that we both did this together, celebrate together with family afterwards at my favorite restaurant, and just have a final deep breath of relief with my fiance and family that I actually completed my program. I want to have every monumental accomplishments and experiences shared with him.",72

zaaxdh,Catholicism,0,Job trying to force me to work Feast of the Immaculate Conception even though I said I couldn’t,18
zaaxdh,Catholicism,1,As you all probably know December 8th is the feast of the immaculate conception. I cashier after school twice a week and weekends and the one day I said I couldn’t work in December was the 8th but they scheduled me anyways. (My work has ignored a lot of my availability but that’s besides the point.) Do I have any legal rights in this situation? Or do you have any suggestions for how I should explain to them why I can’t work that day.,84
zaaxdh,Catholicism,2,Masses are either during the school day or during my shift at all the parishes around me.,17
zaaxdh,Catholicism,3,"I'd ask your boss one more time as they could have forgot. If they say no, I'd inform them you'll be calling out that day for your religious obligation. And then do just that.",34
zaaxdh,Catholicism,4,"Could be just an oversight. Tell your boss again that you need off so you can attend church. Can you work before and after, like just take a longer lunch break or whatever? Can you get someone else to cover for you?",42
zaaxdh,Catholicism,5,> Do I have any legal rights in this situation?,10
zaaxdh,Catholicism,6,"If you are in the United States, your employer may be breaking Federal and State law by denying you a reasonable religious accommodation",23
zaaxdh,Catholicism,7,"My suggestion is to clearly state, in writing to your superior, that your religion requires you to attend a worship service on December 8th and your scheduled shift conflicts with the worship service you will be attending. Most likely they will do nothing, but if they do you have etablished evidence for a religious discrimination claim.",56
zaaxdh,Catholicism,8,Any chance of making it to a Vigil Mass on the evening of the 7th? Not optimal but meets the obligation without making too many waves at work.,28
zaaxdh,Catholicism,9,"My daughter is 17 and works 15-20 hours a week. It's at a retreat center, so weekends are busy. She's asked that if they have her work Sunday morning, they give her Saturday afternoon off so she can get to Mass. It's a Christian employer so that helps, but they still don't get the concept of ""obligation.""",57
zaaxdh,Catholicism,10,"I would just not show up. If they penalize you somehow, threaten legal action for religious discrimination.",17
zaaxdh,Catholicism,11,"Tell them you aren't asking. If they have scheduling problems they don't have enough employees and probably won't fire you. If they do, you're better off finding a different job anyway. You're way too young to put up with that kind of disrespect to your time.",46
zaaxdh,Catholicism,12,"Just be calm. ""I saw Im on the schedule next week, I need to attend mass at (offer available mass times)"" I'm happy to be flexible, I just need to be there for an hour + travel, anything you can do to help me?""",44

zaaxdh,Catholicism,16,"**Firm Approach**: Reiterate to your boss (verbally and in writing) that you need that day off for religious reasons and you refuse to work that day, period. Make him fix it himself.",32
zaaxdh,Catholicism,17,**Scorched Earth**: Call a lawyer.,5
zaaxdh,Catholicism,18,"You can always just not show up. Tell them you cannot be at work that day, you already notified them, and let them know you won’t be coming. If they fire you (they won’t) there are MANY other cashier jobs around. This is not an important job, don’t even give them an inch.",53
zaaxdh,Catholicism,19,"If I were in the situation, I would first reiterate to the boss that I would be unavailable that day, and if the boss refused to change it, I would just give the boss an ultimatum: either take me off the schedule or I quit.",45
zaaxdh,Catholicism,20,"I had to deal with this when Gamestop was putting up blasphemous images of the Sacred Heart. Tell them you are protected under the law by Title 7 of EEOA. Once they understood this, they started whistling a different tune and went out of their way to keep me away from stuff involving the offensive. These laws are for your protection in the US.",64
zaaxdh,Catholicism,21,Your school can likely function without you for an hour or two easier than your employer can. Can you miss a class or two and go during the school day?,30
zaaxdh,Catholicism,22,"Not sure where your parents fit in, but would they be open to excusing you from classes to attend Mass?",20
zaaxdh,Catholicism,23,Well I work in the evenings so they don’t give me any breaks those days. I’m the only cashier working usually too. Most of the people I work with refuse to work at night and the other people who do are usually too busy to take on another shift. I’ll definitely ask though,53
zaaxdh,Catholicism,24,I don’t think there’s any past 8pm at the parishes around me but I could double check.,17
zaaxdh,Catholicism,25,"No, you should definitely inform your employer that it is a religious holiday",13
zaaxdh,Catholicism,26,Usually people don’t switch with me but I’ll definitely try. Worst comes to worse can I actually hire a lawyer?,20
zaaxdh,Catholicism,27,"Don’t quit. If they want to fire you over a religious obligation, let them.",14
zaaxdh,Catholicism,28,That’s a terrible idea…and also illegal,6
zaaxdh,Catholicism,29,I mean i could but my mom isn’t Catholic and she wouldn’t be willing to call me out of school.,20
zaaxdh,Catholicism,30,So you can't get to a Mass during the day? I realize that you said you're a student.,18
zaaxdh,Catholicism,31,I assumed they had already done that.,7
zaaxdh,Catholicism,32,> can I actually hire a lawyer?,7
zaaxdh,Catholicism,33,You can...but you can likely kiss the job goodbye and it'll cost you a lot of money.,17
zaaxdh,Catholicism,34,"Leaving school for a couple hours is illegal? I don't know this person to be a minor, and even if they are, I don't know of anywhere that a parent can't pull a student out of school for a short period of time. Hell, we routinely pull kids out for a week at a time to go deer hunting.",59
zaaxdh,Catholicism,35,I can’t unless I skipped school,6
zaaxdh,Catholicism,36,It’s illegal for a business to have a high school kid come to work during his class time.,18
zaaxdh,Catholicism,37,OP is clearly some high schooler.,6
zaaxdh,Catholicism,38,"Well it depends on what would be the worse consequences.... missing a class or two, or possibly losing your job. 🤷🏼‍♂️",21
zaaxdh,Catholicism,39,I didn’t suggest having anyone leave school to go to work.,11
zaaxdh,Catholicism,40,"That said, when I was a senior in highschool I went to school for half of a day and worked half a day so it isn’t illegal here. I had all the credits I needed by then though.",38
zaaxdh,Catholicism,41,"If you aren’t in school at the time then it’s legal, but an employer cannot be having student workers sipping to work. OP seems imply they are in class.",29
zaaxdh,Catholicism,42,Nobody suggested that the employer would be having the student miss class to work. I suggested they miss class to attend Mass.,22

zabslv,saskatchewan,3,"If they don't qualify for legal aid, try a mediator.",10
zabslv,saskatchewan,4,Call Pro Bono Law Saskatchewan. They run a bunch of free legal clinics throughout the province. You can get an appointment with a lawyer to ask questions.,27

zacpdj,Christianity,0,Can someone explain this for me please?,7
zacpdj,Christianity,1,"I was at church, listening to the youth pastor talk. I zoned out for a second and had a vision. I was looking through the eyes of Jesus while he was on the cross. I could see and look around. I saw his feet and hands nailed to the cross and all the people staring at him. I saw the landscape around him. It was grey and cloudy, there were a lot of rocks, and they were on a cliff. I could literally see everything perfectly. I was wondering if anyone knew what it meant. This has never happened to me before so I don’t know what to think of this.",111

zacpdj,Christianity,8,"I have. When I do it’s quick, faint and I don’t really remember what I daydreamed about after a while. What I saw was so vivid and realistic. I can tell you exactly what I saw detail for detail right now, the day after. It could’ve been a daydream but if it was, I have never had anything like that before.",61
zacpdj,Christianity,9,"Do you remember every dream, everything that ever happened to you?",11
zacpdj,Christianity,10,"Memory is like that. Some things stick. This particular dream seemed unusual to you and you’ve assigned significance to it, so it’s getting priority memory space.",26

zad3s2,aircanada,0,Possibly dumb layover question,4
zad3s2,aircanada,1,"Hi there, not sure if anyone can help me with this but I’m a little worried about my layover time for an upcoming AC flight. In mid January I’m flying from Halifax to New York through Montreal. The first flight gets into YUL at around 7:40am. It’s then an hour and a half layover before the flight to New York. Am I going to be screwed for getting through customs? I know technically the airline wouldn’t offer the trip if it wasn’t enough time but I haven’t flown internationally since long before COVID so I’m panicking a little. I’m not checking any bags which I think helps my case. I’m also travelling alone if that makes a difference. If anyone has any insight on whether I should look into changing my flight please let me know!",136
zad3s2,aircanada,2,"There are flights from Montréal to NYC almost every hour in the morning. If you do miss the connection, AC will just put you in the next flight. The caveat is which NYC airport you will be put on to.",40
zad3s2,aircanada,3,"It will be tight that time of the morning, but they pulled ppl from the connections line through customs last time I was there in a long line so you should be fine. Not having a checked bag will save you hours and hours if you were to misconnect.",49
zad3s2,aircanada,4,"Should be fine. Last time I did transborder in YUL was in October and the luggage was the slow bit at US customs so if you can avoid checking a bag that will help. But as long as your departure is on time it should be fine. As someone else mentioned, there are lots of other daily flights so worst case is you get rebooked a few hours later.",69
zad898,breastcancer,0,Feeling Devastated,2
zad898,breastcancer,1,I was diagnosed with DCIS and tested positive for BRCA2. I have had to make the difficult decision of getting a double mastectomy and reconstruction. I will also get my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.,35
zad898,breastcancer,2,I am devastated that the body that I know will drastically change. I don’t want implants but I also don’t want to lose my breasts so I opted for implants. Using my own tissue is possible but it means going to a new hospital and starting the process all over again with a new care team (which I also don’t want).,61
zad898,breastcancer,3,It’s hard to accept and even harder when it’s getting closer to setting a surgery date. It’s super alienating and I don’t even feel like a person anymore.,28
zad898,breastcancer,4,"I hope it gets better but it’s hard to see anything but losses. I am a young person and just.. I feel so robbed of so many things. I feel so sad. I am also single too so there is also the worry that no one would accept me with no nipple, and scarred. Just venting…",56
zad898,breastcancer,5,"Ask if you are a candidate for nipple sparing mastectomy. I had that. I am only at the spacer stage, but am impressed how good they look and how delicate the scarring is.",33
zad898,breastcancer,6,I also had an oophrectomy at the same time as the BMx.,12
zad898,breastcancer,7,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I honestly hate breast cancer (or any kind of cancer) so much. It’s unfair and no one ever deserves this, especially women who have to sacrifice their boobs.",35
zad898,breastcancer,8,I’m amazed by those who are able to make the hard decisions (though what choice do we have?). I can’t imagine how painful and uncomfortable reconstruction will be.,28
zad898,breastcancer,9,"Though there is nothing I can do for you, I’ll be thinking of you, my fellow sister. If this helps at all, know that there are so many women in the same boat as you, and you’re not alone. Rant and vent here all you want and we will hear your voice. The world is cruel enough as it is, but this is your safe place.",66
zad898,breastcancer,10,Wishing you a speedy recovery!,5
zad898,breastcancer,11,"I’m so sorry you have to deal with this. Ask your team if you’re a candidate for a nipple sparing mastectomy. My nipples lost all sensation which is hard to adjust to, but aesthetically they look fine.",37
zad898,breastcancer,12,"One thing to consider is that implants don’t have to be permanent. I wasn’t a candidate for a tissue flap surgery, but my plastic surgeon said I can get implants right now and then get them removed and do a flap procedure in the future. It will end up being extra surgeries down the line, but it might be worth it if you want to get it over with as quickly as possible.",73
zad898,breastcancer,13,"Also, I can only have sex with a bra on now. It’s been a year and a half and it’s still super emotional for me to take my bra off around someone. Not one guy has ever complained about me wearing a bra during sex. They’re just excited to be having sex!",52
zad898,breastcancer,14,Keeping you in my thoughts <3,6
zad898,breastcancer,15,Same here! I'm only 36 and looking at double mastectomy with removal of ovaries and fallopian tunes in the future. I have an appt next Tuesday and will hopefully be setting up my surgery after that appt. I am here and going to be going through a similar experience if you wanted to chat at all! Best wishes to you.,60
zad898,breastcancer,16,Hugs to you,3
zad898,breastcancer,17,"Asking with the nipple-sparing surgeries, you also have the option of tattooing nipples on your breasts if you choose, along with nipple reconstruction surgery. I was offered the nipple reconstruction as part of the DIEP recommendation but eagerly opted to pass. I spent my entire life trying to hide my very temperature responsive nipples and was happy to never have to think about that again. I haven't yet decided what to do about nipples, I'm going the tattoo route but haven't decided if I'm going to get a regular nipple or go for something more creative. There are a lot of beautiful images if you search for mastectomy tattoos.",109
zad898,breastcancer,18,"I'm sorry that you're facing such a hard situation. It sucks. As others have said, you are not your boobs, you are a person with boobs that needs to get rid of them before they kill you. It feels like a betrayal, but it gets easier over time.

I prayed about what to do and decided it was my body and I was going to work thru this. I do not understand why they remove other female organs. There was nothing wrong with me but one breast and the cancer had gone to stage four and was in my back, abdomen, liver and right knee.",92
zad898,breastcancer,22,"I know that it is easy to panic at this being in your body but I pray that you will be able to stop and work thru this. I changed my diet, took one small chemo pill (doctor insisted that if she was going to treat me and help me to monitor my progress). It has been five years. I had four years of progress and the fifth year my immune system was weakened and the cancer went up on me. But I focused on being grateful, eating and exercising and low stress, as much as possible. I take a handful of supplements each day to keep my body healthy.",110
zad898,breastcancer,23,"I am praying for you to find the plan that will work for you. God bless you dear one. One thing that worked for me and I have seen work for others was that I didn’t let cancer define me. I am a person first, with a life and I refused to let the cancer overtake me. I am thankful for each day. I am thankful for the healing. I accept each day as valuable and look forward to what each day offers and will not live with the regret of turning myself over to someone else to make my decisions. I live each day to the fullest and try to accept that this is the NEW Me.",118

zad898,breastcancer,26,Hi. I had the same thing and opted for DCIS instead of implants. Just a thought,16
zad898,breastcancer,27,I also had a nipple and skin sparing mastectomy. I'm shocked how normal my reconstructed breasts look. The only incision is along the breast crease.,25
zad898,breastcancer,28,I will ask. I know my oncologist is not a fan of keeping it because the cancer is there. Thank you for the tip.,24
zad898,breastcancer,29,Thank you so much. I appreciate the support and kind words. We don’t have many choices except to save our lives.,21
zad898,breastcancer,30,I want to eventually replace the implants with my own tissue. My first objective is to get rid of the cancer first. Thank you for your lovely words.,28
zad898,breastcancer,31,I’m sorry you had to go through this too.,9
zad898,breastcancer,32,Are you me? I’m turning 36 this year. It’s so hard to accept all these massive changes. I hope you’re doing okay. BRCA2 is evil. I wish you all the best with your surgeries and healing.,36
zad898,breastcancer,33,Thanks! I am doing pretty well I think! I get so anxious as my appts get closer. It's hard not knowing what to expect! I am happy to read through other people's experiences! Makes me feel less alone! Brca is evil for sure! Decimated my dad's side of the family so I feel fortunate that I became aware at a younger age. I keep trying to look at the positives.,70

zad898,breastcancer,39,"Same! I had resigned myself to awful scars, but maybe they would look cool? Like war wounds? A car accident but I survived? Or maybe they wouldn’t be awful, but surely my breasts would never look good.",37
zad898,breastcancer,40,When the scabs fell off from nipples (it took *ages* on one breast) I was stunned how good they looked.,20
zad898,breastcancer,41,"I guess they will redo the incision edges when I have the spacers removed and the implants placed, and *then* they’ll be careful about the scars. Silicone coverings and such. I blurted out: “these the “bad” scars?!?”",37
zad898,breastcancer,42,"The scars are very thin, and only slightly red (which will fade). Where it is red, it perfectly matches the areola. They’re perky and even. I love them, and they aren’t even in their final form.",36
zad898,breastcancer,43,"I hope this helps. I was vain about my nipples (it’s not good to be vain, but I was) and so I was scared how things would look. I hope my (anecdotal) data helps someone.",35
zad898,breastcancer,44,"It’s easy for me to say because I was lucky enough to keep both nipples, but looking at pictures of my PS’s work, I was shocked how good the “constructed” nipples looked. Then I assumed, oh, they look good now but will deteriorate or shrink or something in 5 years. But her PA (who I trust perhaps most of all my cancer medical people) said that rarely happens. Anyway, this made me less scared at the potential mine would die or need to be removed. I mean, they looked *good*.",90

zad898,breastcancer,49,I did follow up with a PAP flap reconstruction a few weeks ago which came with a startling number of incisions. Everything is healing really well and I'm thrilled with the results. I will have some scars but nothing as disfiguring as I envisioned in my mind. My surgeon cut through a tattoo on the front of my hip and you can't even tell at 3 weeks out. It's incredible. I am already much more comfortable in my skin that I anticipated at this stage. Now if only my hair could grow back faster!,94
zadpq7,detrans,0,Our inability to discuss transitioning rationally as a society is worrisome.,11
zadpq7,detrans,1,It’s very taboo to even suggest that a 12 year old child might not be in the right mind when they come out as trans.,25
zadpq7,detrans,2,I work with mentally ill adolescents and half of them have some degree of gender dysphoria and identify as trans.,20
zadpq7,detrans,3,"It's way too politicized. This sort of thing should be science based, not ideological...",14
zadpq7,detrans,4,"Very true, trans has become rebellion, defiance, assertion for adolescents.",10
zadpq7,detrans,5,"That age is so vulnerable as they are looking for adults to admire and establish a way to be unique. Prime age for gang recruitment, sexual exploration, talking into drug experimentation. And now transgenderism has been presented to kids almost like ""here try this joint, show you're cool""",48
zadpq7,detrans,6,Yeah. It's the unfortunate result of the pendulum swinging the other way combining with social media and backlash to anti-trans persecution.,21
zadpq7,detrans,7,"I expect it will not be long until the ""groomer"" narrative and the bad PR makes it swings back and trans people are forced back to the periphery of society.",30

zadpq7,detrans,9,Right now we can’t discuss anything rationally.,7
zadpq7,detrans,10,Yup. Makes me think about who it’s benefitting,8
zadpq7,detrans,11,"There's been many studies proving that human's frontal lobes, especially where we logically weigh risks and think of the future, don't fully develop until our early twenties. On top of that, there's a lot of fantasy and support for anyone that likes to deviate from the norm, no matter how odd or strange. Got a really strange, possibly isolating or even unhealthy kink shared by maybe 10k out of 8 billion people? The internet will make it seem like you're not alone, enabling you with all illusions you could hope for.",91
zadpq7,detrans,12,"Very recently I went to a public concert where another attendee showed up in a head to toe anthropomorphic furry outfit. My spouse's immediate reaction was to exhale and say, ""Well I don't think anyone will be looking too closely at *me* tonight."" We came to learn later that night that he now lives full time as his ""fursona"", using only his fursona name. He's married, works from home full time in IT, and his spouse was with him. I would like to say his spouse supports him, but she honestly looked pretty uncomfortable and resigned anytime I dared to look. No way to know how old he was, but it had to be late 20's early 30's if it matched the age of his wife.",126
zadpq7,detrans,13,"Certainly gave me a lot to think about since then... I imagine that was an interesting conversation to have with his immediate family. Sort of puts a lot of perspective on ""coming out, being brave, living your truth."" My spouse, for all their journey's, didn't seem very supportive. I still don't know how I feel, other than... sympathy. I'm afraid to look into it more too, lest the algorithms take my curiosity for earnest interest.",75
zadpq7,detrans,14,"I will say, from what I have observed, is that *a lot* of young people simply consider transitioning ""an option"" versus an affirmation; and often with the argument that, ""people should just be allowed to do what they want, it's not hurting anyone right?""",44

zadpq7,detrans,18,"I recently read that as many as 2% of people are intersex, about the same rate as people with red hair. So if you've met someone with red hair, you've probably met someone who is intersex. In addition to my spouse I currently know a woman who is quite tall, grows a full beard (has an obvious five o'clock shadow otherwise), and visually doesn't pass for female very well. But, she IS female, genuinely FAB, and has had children. I don't remember the specifics are for her medical diagnosis, but her existence has been a valuable lesson to concepts held by others.",102
zadpq7,detrans,19,"Many people I know believe as I do, that it's entirely natural to be homosexual (or bisexual within a spectrum of homo and hetero). But many people think there is only male or female, and scientifically I know that there's a hell of a lot more variables regarding sex.",49
zadpq7,detrans,20,"After a lot of study (and I'm talking 20+ years here) I'm of the opinion that a lot of true transexuals do exist and are inherently intersex, and that depending on the medical diagnosis there's a spectrum there too, but the peer science is lacking. And that spectrum can change-- there was a case of an intersex man with Klinefelter's whom after an illness their adrenals reset and their body went with the XX instead of the XY of their natural XXY state.",83
zadpq7,detrans,21,"Thus, he grew breasts and his body began naturally feminizing. Having always felt female privately, once their body changed, that person chose to transition. Whether or not they got bottom surgery I don't know, but they were effectively a woman with working male sex organs otherwise. Again, it bothers me greatly when people argue that intersex people still must be one or the other, like there can't somehow be a spectrum there too.",73
zadpq7,detrans,22,"I think it would be very helpful if genetic and medical testing were stardard as part of transitioning, including endocrine testing and mapped neurology via MRI, but that would call into question that there's more to it than belief or that people should simply be free to do as they wish. This is further exacerbated in places like the USA where transitioning has become somewhat common but otherwise medicine in general is pretty abysmal.",74

zadpq7,detrans,24,To the question-- so are they in their fursuit now 24-7?,11
zadpq7,detrans,25,"I assume the answer is mostly? Logically I'm pretty sure they don't shower in it. We went to the concert with several friends. One of my friends had a panic attack so security took them out of the venue for a bit, another friend went with them as a support person and they were taken to a quieter area to get some air. The person in their fursuit and his wife was also there, because being around so many people in the fursuit they kept overheating.",86
zadpq7,detrans,26,"My friend who was the support person is utterly fearless and didn't waste the opportunity to chat them up, which is how we found out they're living full-time as their fursona now. They can eat in it, but my friend didn't inquire about other... functions.",45
zadpq7,detrans,27,"On the drive home that night my spouse remarked that if they're in it full time and they're overheating then it must get pretty sweaty and smelly and they must have to get it dry cleaned. They must have multiple sets of the suit too. It was a clearly custom-made high quality fursuit, I can't imagine it's having been inexpensive. Getting multiple made at the same time probably would have been somewhat cost-effective?",73
zae0ap,relationship_advice,0,What is disorganized attachment style?,5
zae0ap,relationship_advice,1,"I used to think i was on the avoidant side of attachment styles until i found myself in two different relationships ( at different times in my life btw, but each a year apart) where i leaned into anxious attachment. Growing and learning about my patterns, taking tests etc has lead me to believe I actually have disorganized attachment which is like a whole mixed up can of worms. My family can be very loving and supportive, but something i realized young is that no one in my family let’s others speak, there is very little listening that goes on and alot of talking at instead of to. This is something that deeply affected me as a child, and still now, the subject of many of my nightmares (ig i have a big fear of not being heard and or being misinterpreted) when i was in college i found myself in a physically but mostly emotionally abusive relationship that took me many years to make sense of and begin to heal from. I mention this bc it has come to my attention that experience most likely greatly affected my attachment style as well.",193
zae0ap,relationship_advice,2,"I guess now i’m just scared bc even though I go to therapy, and have improved with some of my communication skills, i’m just still confused what it means for me to have this attachment style. How can I continue to work on this issue? A lot of stuff i read online makes me worried like my attachment style makes me the most unstable/hardest to deal with of the styles. My partner assumed i was anxiously attached and up until this point I had thought this too. How does this change things now that i feel I am disorganized attached instead?",101

zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,1,TL;DR: There are quite a few traumatic (?) events from my past that involve me and my parents. Are they/were they acting emotionally abusive? Or am I reaching/overreacting? Advice + help needed and appreciated. &lt;3,35

zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,5,"For some context, I (20F), still live with my parents. I do NOT pay my own bills, but I do pay for my own gas and most of my food! I am currently going to school online, and I also have had a part-time job for over two years now.",50
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,6,Here are some events that I’ve made note of in my life (please note that I do not remember my childhood very well. The ages + events are as accurate as I can possibly get them):,36
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,7,***** Ages 4-8: *****,4
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,8,"- • - When I would throw a tantrum, my parents (mainly my mom) would tell me to go into the bathroom, shut the door, and not come out. I would scream, cry, and scratch at the walls/door. The door would never be locked, but I was told that I wasn’t allowed out so I always stayed in the bathroom until they thought I was calm enough to come out.",70
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,9,"- • - One night, after my parents had been yelling at each other (mainly my dad antagonizing my mother), my mom cuddled up to me in her bed (I slept in their bed a lot). We started to hear loud “crunching” noises, so we both got up to see what was going on. My dad was standing over a broken chair in our dining room. He had ripped the entire wooden chair into pieces with his bare hands. I remember being terrified.",83
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,10,"- • - I remember witnessing my dad physically intimidating my mother by backing her into her car door. He was chest to chest with her, and he was yelling. They both knew that I was standing there, afaik. Neither of them remember this event, so I’m not sure if it actually happened. I have brought it up to them a couple of times.",64
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,11,"- • - Around this age, my parents would fight a LOT and threaten divorces in front of me. It got to a point where I, as a small child, actually WISHED that they would get one. This lasted until about age 16 and I believe it has affected my current relationship.",52
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,12,***** Ages 9-13 *****,4
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,13,"- • - My mom decided to open a small business. This is great and I’ll always support her! However, I was ALWAYS at said business. I rarely got to just be at home. I had bad separation anxiety, too, so I never wanted to go hang out with friends. I would be put to work and/or told to go into my mom’s “office”. I was expected to occupy myself, every single day after school, for hours on end. It was frustrating and I remember being upset about it when I was a child. It still upsets me to this day.",101
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,14,"- • - Around this time, I began showing signs of depression and anxiety. I was formally diagnosed and my mom was very supportive of getting me help (getting me into the doctor, encouraging medication, etc.)! I started missing a lot of school during this time due to my mental health. My parents and I fought nearly every single day because I wouldn’t want to go to school. One night, after my parents and I had finished arguing about it, I overheard them talking about me. Being a nosy little shit, I eavesdropped and heard my dad say that my mental illnesses were not real (he has a minor in psych. So, understandably, this made me doubt myself a LOT).",120
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,15,"- • - One night, while out to dinner with my parents, we had gotten into a small argument. I can’t remember what it was about, but I remember that I told them I was “going to run away and kill myself”. My dad hit me in the face for that. (Thx u rlly made it better haha.)",58
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,16,***** Ages 14-20 *****,4
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,17,"- • - By the time I was around 14-15, I was sick of being forced to go to work with my mom at her small business (also, at this point in time, I had transferred to an online school due to mental &amp; physical health reasons). So, I would ask to stay home instead. My mom usually let me stay home every single time that I asked. I would typically be home alone from 10am-8pm during this time. My parents worked a lot, so I barely saw them. One time, I even stayed home alone all day on my birthday (I think I was turning 15 or 16). Yes, I did ask to stay home. However, I really feel like they could’ve made an effort to not neglect (?) me completely.",132
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,18,"- • - My dad and I were in the car together one day (I was driving) when we drove past a slew of protesters in our city. He asked what they were protesting, and I told him that they were “pro-lifers” protesting on the opposite street of a non-profit women’s clinic (this clinic offers free pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and doesn’t even perform abortions nor refers patients). My dad, being a pro-lifer, began going on a tangent about being pro-life and why abortion was morally wrong. Me, being pro-choice, naturally began debating him. When things got too heated, I politely asked him to stop because I was getting angry and wanted to drop it. He kept going, and I kept asking him to stop. Finally, I snapped and began yelling at him (which I knew would happen). He told me to “pull the fucking car over” and that he would “walk home”. He got out of the car, I asked him to get back in, and he refused. So, I drove home without him. I was home with my mom (who was trying to calm me down) for about 30-40 minutes. My dad finally walks in, slams the door, and starts yelling at me for not turning around and getting him. (??? What.)",213
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,19,"- • - The most recent and intense argument occurred a few weeks ago. The entire explanation is too long, but here are some of the things that they said during it:",32
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,20,“Oh we’re SUCH bad parents”,5
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,21,“Oh I’m SUCH a bad mom”,6

zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,30,"yeah, a lot of these things sound like neglect and/or emotional/verbal abuse. also the ""we must be SUCH bad parents"" thing is 100% gaslighting and manipulative",26
zaekha,emotionalneglect,0,What should I do?,4
zaekha,emotionalneglect,1,I don’t know what to do. My therapist told me I was emotionally neglected by my mum for 7 yrs. I’m mad and I want an apology but I think things will go down badly. I want to run away from home because it seems like fun but mainly because I want to show my mum how much she has affected me and to get away from her. I’m going on holiday with her for 5 weeks. Last time we went on holiday she was an A-hole. I don’t know what to do lol,94
zaekha,emotionalneglect,2,"hey friend, sorry you're going through this. feeling angry and grieving is natural and healthy as a reaction to what you've been through. I will say that it's going to be much harder for you to create a space of healing and change while still living with her, but it's possible to start. first, try writing her a letter with all the things you want to say, and then -this is critical- burn the letter. your mother is not emotionally mature or capable enough to be able to give you the closure you need and to meet you on the level you need from her, and I'm sorry about that. It's a hard thing to hear and harder still to accept, but that is part of the process. Confronting your mother won't help you right now, and may make you more unsafe.",142
zaekha,emotionalneglect,3,"There are many types of emotional neglect and many ways it presents, but I found the books Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, How to Do The Work, and It Didn't Start With You to be extremely helpful in starting to heal and understand what happened to me. as for your trip- I don't know your mother's mannerisms and behaviors, so I couldn't tell you what the best approach is, but I would suggest looking up ""Grey Rocking""- Patrick Teahan on youtube has an excellent series about grey rocking, what it looks like, how to practice, etc.",97
zaekha,emotionalneglect,4,"I don't know how nosy your mother is, but mine always read any journal I tried to keep. I ended up making a made-up script only I can read so I could journal safely until I could get out. It might be worth thinking about as a safe way to have catharsis.",52

zahemu,techsupport,0,Very odd issue with wordpress websites hosted on Hetzner - connection timeout from within the office,16
zahemu,techsupport,1,"I occassionally assist with basic IT stuff at a small office that runs a couple of wordpress websites hosted on Hetzner, along with an email server.",26
zahemu,techsupport,2,"This is a very basic setup, with a consumer grade VDSL modem/router (Fritzbox), a gigabit switch and a TP Link mesh wifi system. Most computers in the office are laptops, connecting via wifi.",33
zahemu,techsupport,3,"During the past year or so, they've faced the following very odd issue: randomly, during the day, they are unable to access said websites from their office's internet connection. All browsers report a connection timeout issue. The websites however are still up and accesible - just not through their office internet connection and by extension through their public IP, assigned to them by their ISP. When connecting via a VPN for example, the websites work.",75
zahemu,techsupport,4,"After restarting their modem/router, they are assigned a new public IP by their ISP, and the websites load once again, only to randomly stop working after a few hours.",29
zahemu,techsupport,5,"Now the guy who'd been subcontracted to built the websites and configured the apache server &amp; Plesk says that he can't see anything out of the ordinary -but he's not helpful at all, always giving excuses that he can't look into this. It's obvious to me this is a server side issue -there are at most about 5 or 6 computers on the office network, sharing its internet access, 4 are M1 Macs, 2 are PCs, with clean Windows installs -nothing suspicious running on these computers that could trigger a particularly sensitive firewall rule on Hetzner's side. The wordpress sites are edited either via WPBakery or Elementor.",107
zahemu,techsupport,6,"Are there any WP plugins that could be causing this 'blacklisting' of their public IP? I was discussing this issue with a friend who recommended that perhaps the firewall on Hetzner's side gets triggered due to too many POST requests when editing said websites, which usually happens with third party website building tools. But this connection issue occurs randomly, even when they haven't touched the websites for the entire day.",70
zahemu,techsupport,7,Does anyone have any ideas?,5
zahemu,techsupport,8,"I think you're on the right path, very likely something coming from the network is triggering a firewall/IDS rule on Hetzner server/network that's triggering this lock out behavior.",28
zahemu,techsupport,9,"It's probably easiest to ask Hetzner about it, but if they are uncooperative then you'll have to watch your outgoing traffic with some sort of tool and hope you can find something. Presumably the connection is encrypted, so this could get difficult.",42
zahemu,techsupport,10,"The plan they have with Hetzner is a very basic hosting plan. Essentially Hetzner said 'you configured the server/firewall/wordpress stuff, we just provide the VM these run on, so you are responsible for making sure it works right, we can't assist in this'.",43
zahemu,techsupport,11,"Okay, yeah, the guy that set it up is the only one that knows what he did.",17
zahemu,techsupport,12,"I guess you could have another expert look at what's configured, but this isn't some easy thing to figure out. I can think of a lot of things that could cause this. From Wordpress plugins to IDSes, Apache modules, etc.",40
zahemu,techsupport,13,One very quick workaround you could try is reconfiguring the firewall with an ACCEPT rule for the Office IP as the first rule. That way any later rules made by some sort of solution can't block the office IP.,39

zakb97,relationship_advice,2,"I’m a 28 y.o. guy and the girl i dated till recently is 23. I met her 4 months ago and since then we’ve been together, and our relationship was so nice, without any arguments, or fights or anything. We understood eachother at a deeper level. We did all things together (e.g cooking, cleaning, etc.). About a week ago or so, she said she needs time for her to solve her personal issue, and she said that she can’t do that while being with me because she doesn’t want to hurt me with her behaviour/ problems. She’s going to go through a dermatological intervention, she’ll have a 5 week exam session and has to write her bachelor’s degree as she’s in the last year of Uni. I gave her the space she needed after we talked, and since then we’ve talked a bit, but obviously the conversation is not as it was before. She said she doesn’t want for me to wait for her, because it would make her feel bad. In the meanwhile i decided to stop smoking drinking(haven’t been drinking a lot before either, but it messes with my training) and hitting the Gym to distract myself from thinking of her. My question is, should i wait for her to solve her stuff and get back together, even if that means waiting for half a year or so or should i just forget about her? I know she asked this for the right reasons, because she’s got a lot on her plate right now. Any answer would be much appreciated",262

zamony,AskConservatives,0,What do you see happening in the future. So Republicans seem to be about cutting entitlements. Yet more and more people live paycheck to paycheck. So what happens when those people go to retire?,34

My financial guy tells me that if I want to live in retirement the way I live now I need at least a million dollars in the bank. And that is with SS. IDK, I live in the same house I bought in 1990, we drive Hyundais that are 5 and 10 years old. I paid for my kids to go to college (in state) and our family income is roughly DOUBLE the average family income. I'm not going to have close to a million dollars.",96
zamony,AskConservatives,2,"Pay has been pushed down for close to a generation. Fully 1/4 of Americans make $15 or less, close to 1/3 make $18.00 or less. Even with a dual income those people aren't putting a lot of money away. My two late 20s sons one with some college the other with a degree have what they consider decent jobs and are making around $50k . Both are a major car problem from going into debt. OK, they should eventually start making more money, but if you start putting money away at 35, you aren't gong to be able to retire on the money you saved. If you cut entitlements but then cut the money you are bringing in, so people can invest by themselves how is this helping.",128

zamony,AskConservatives,30,"It's a nice theory that doesn't work in practice. Social security attackers seem to forget that SS hasn't been around forever. And before it was around, their was a lot more elderly poverty. AND the elderly weren't even living nearly as long as they do now.",46

When I got my first job in the late 1970s I got min wage of $2.10, BUT the full time people got $2.80 to start. they got holiday bonuses and yearly raises. Some people were there for 20 years, even at 5 or 10 cents a year they were making $5 an hour (over $22.00 in today's money.) Retail managers aren't making that in many stores today.",94

Raises have been averaging under 3% a year, (inflation is higher) No matching for their retirement. And those are ""good"" jobs.",50
unknown,unknown,62,"So assuming you have a 130k start, and you ll retire in 40 years (I d assume less given your new salary, but lets use it as a nice round number) you d have to have a stable 6% returns rate, and zero taxation on that income. Thats a REALLY sweet deal you got there, and I dont think people can replicate this easily. Where I live, 5% is considered the top end of low risk investment, typically real estate in safe areas. Capital income tax takes a 25% bite out of the returns, and of course you need to consider inflation, so to maintain the actual value you d need close to 8-10% depending on how the new inflation settles.",121

We're not pioneers on a largely uninhabited frontier where land is not a scarce resource. Scarcity makes it valuable and thus costly. This costliness means that there is real value to being able to utilize property WITHOUT having to devote and put at risk your own resources up front necessary to make a purchase either because you don't have such resources or because you have better uses for them. THIS is a very real value which a landlord is providing to his tenants: He invested HIS resources up-front, and is putting HIS resources at risk so YOU don't have to. And the premium he's able to charge above his own costs is set by the value of his service determined by the competition between landlords and between potential tenants in a free market for real estate and rental units.",157
unknown,unknown,200,If you think his service is of no value then you're free to not use it. Go out and buy the property rather than pay rent. If the reason you don't is because you *can't*... That just *proves* that he is contributing something of real value for his rental income.,50

zan65s,Welding,0,Can welding still damage your eyes even if you wear eye protection?,12
zan65s,Welding,1,"I'm about to go into college to start learning about how to weld. I chose it cause people say the pay is good and honestly I like doing manual work and think it'll be interesting. But I have a question, even if you wear eye protection can it still damage your eyes due to long exposure even if you're wearing it? Thank you.",63
zan65s,Welding,2,"If you're wearing the right eye protection at the proper time, and wearing it correctly, your eyes will be fine, even with long term exposure",25
zan65s,Welding,3,"Your respiratory system is much less forgiving, wear a good respirator and check your filters often",16
zan65s,Welding,4,"Put your safety first , think of the long haul …. The ones that last in this game are the ones who protect themselves and work smart . Treat your body like shit and it will break down . Yea it’s not the safest trade but there’s also a lot of idiots who skip safety and end up paying for it.",61
zan65s,Welding,5,Use the proper shade number for what you're doing.,9
zan65s,Welding,6,"I saw guys using number 8 shades while stick welding cuz ""they couldn't see the pool"" fucking blinding when I tried their hood.",23
zan65s,Welding,7,"We are also using glass. Auto seems to be ""lighter"" than glass I was 11 with glass and auto I was 12. Stick at 125amps.",25
zan65s,Welding,8,"The damage from welding comes from UV exposure. Every welding hood will block it completely and even clear polycarbonate lenses will block over 99%, so it is a good idea to ALWAYS be wearing clear safeties in a shop environment, even under a welding hood, in case you accidentally get flashed.",51
zan65s,Welding,9,"As someone else said, the much much more significant long term exposure risk is respiratory.",15
zan65s,Welding,10,"I believe that it can. I have been welding for decades, and I always use the darkest shade available, usually a 12. But at the end of a given day, I still feel eyestrain and irritation on occasion. I also have a lot of floaters, which I feel developed over time while welding.",53
zan65s,Welding,11,Also you have to be careful about the arc flash reflecting off stuff behind you and coming in from the back of the helmet. And then there are the inevitable unintentional arc strikes where you end up getting flashed by someone else.,42
zan65s,Welding,12,"If you are super careful and use the proper PPE you will likely be OK, but the potential is still there and you should be aware of that.",28
zan65s,Welding,13,[deleted],1
zan65s,Welding,14,Yes but not the way you think. Think like a lifetime of reading eye strain. Super focused on minute detailed things,21
zan65s,Welding,15,The long-term effects of welding very very close it's tough on the eyes seriously have you seen any old welders you don't have glasses on when you focus your muscles that close to your face all the time and puts a lot of strain on them so you have to be aware of that in terms of the shielding glass keeping your eyes safe yeah you'll be fine,68
zan65s,Welding,16,You have to make sure you are on the right shade,11
zan65s,Welding,17,"You’ll get arc flash… a lot. But that’s just part of the trade. However (correct me if I’m wrong), some if not most safety glasses by them selves have a slight amount of UV protection.",35
zan65s,Welding,18,"As for daily under the hood, there’s different shade levels and it’s all up to preference from there.",18
zan65s,Welding,19,Everything in life will kill you. Happy Friday!!,8
zan65s,Welding,20,Even with protection if you don’t have a full headgear you can get some exposure from other welders in the shop. Depends on how many and if there are screens available. I just weld at home so not an issue for me but an associate is a production welder and he occasionally gets some exposure from others. Also you need to set your hood setting correct or have the correct fixed lens for the process you are using. (There’s plenty on the internet to advise lens shade or equivalent for different processes) happy welding!,94
zan65s,Welding,21,The hardest thing on a welders eyes are the women. You meet Suzie Rotten Crotch in a bar at night. She is a portable beauty queen. However the next morning when you wake up and she is laying next to you your thinking what happened to the queen I left with last night. Some of these gals can be extremely hard on the eyes.,64
zan65s,Welding,22,Going to college? Where do you live? If you can find a local union and try to start an apprenticeship it will be a lot cheaper school. They will give you a job and work conditions are better than non union jobs,42
zan65s,Welding,23,"Not really, but yes. Any exposure to UV light is damaging. Using the proper shade will just delay the inevitable. The real question is if you want to be blind at 60 or 90.",34
zan65s,Welding,24,Depends on the eye protection,5
zan65s,Welding,25,Get UV protection glasses and use at least a 12 shade in your mask.,14
zan65s,Welding,26,"I feel like I have been pretty careful with my eyes during my career, but still developed night blindness a few years in. Not sure I could have done more to protect them.",33
zan65s,Welding,27,"Hello! Just keep in mind, the light you are protecting from, is uv light, so it is invisible, is not the glare you can see when welding.",27
zan65s,Welding,28,"That being said, if your are next to other people welding, let's say in a classroom, even if you are not welding remember that that light still bounces in the walls of the room, so if you think that as long you are not staring at the visible glare your are ok, you'd be wrong, all the people in the room will be the same exposed to a light that behaves like light but you cannot see.",77
zan65s,Welding,29,Enjoy your journey!!!,3
zan65s,Welding,30,Jeez! Reading some replies here is making me glad I'm just a hobby welder.,14
zan65s,Welding,31,"I use shade 12 (with blue eyes) at all times, unless using Flux core, then it's shade 13. My eyes are fine, after 17 years, even though my whole family wears glasses. My breathing was always bad because of asthma, but since I started wearing a respirator at ALL TIMES it's been much better! Always care about your lungs! Eyes have an easy crutch (glasses).....you lungs not so much.",69

zan65s,Welding,35,Noted. Thank ya friend :),5
zan65s,Welding,36,My throat and nose feels kind of soar after working at the factory for 12h. We have air filtered welding masks.. it's all the anti spatter spray fumes saturating the air.. the ventilation system can't keep up. Feels like I need to wear a respirator in there even when I'm not welding.,52
zan65s,Welding,37,After 20 years in the industry my eye are fine. I have only had arc flash 3 times. It's from when someone welds to close behind you. The light will reflect off the inside of your glasses and into your eye.,41
zan65s,Welding,38,"Yeah, every shop has that guy who practically abuses himself on behalf of the boss. ""I don't have a choice, I just gotta get it done"" he says before returning to cutting steel without gloves or glasses on. It takes him a moment to do anything near the floor because his knees are so fucked he can't bend or squat and it's always questionable if he's gonna make it back up...",71
zan65s,Welding,39,That guy keeps me reminded that the boss is less important to me than myself. Fuck anyone who wants me to become disabled to meet some bottom line figure written by some asshat who doesn't even know what his employees do.,41
zan65s,Welding,40,Shade 8 and stick welding shouldn’t be in the same sentence,11
zan65s,Welding,41,Everyone's eyes process light differently. So its possible that he was just less sensitive to light than most people.,19
zan65s,Welding,42,Not to mention in case some grinding wheel explodes or some other thing sends fragments of stuff at your eyes!,20
zan65s,Welding,43,"I feel like the eye strain might be caused from focusing on one point for too long, and possibly using too dark of a shade making it harder to see. Though that depends on what you’re doing of course.",39

zan65s,Welding,61,My apologies to you maam.,5
zan65s,Welding,62,But what kind of welding are they teaching? If you get in pipefitting/ welding local you can go to school through them for free or next to nothing.

zankl3,zoloft,3,2 to 6 weeks,4

zankl3,zoloft,7,9 weeks before first improvements.,5
zankl3,zoloft,8,About 3-4 weeks for me. I moved up doses to 100mg within 3 weeks though because I was dealing with severe panic disorder. Most people don’t up their dose as quickly as I did.,34

zankl3,zoloft,15,That’s so rough. I relate. I had awful insomnia for a while too but for me it was because of my panic disorder and OCD flare up since I was having insomnia before getting on Zoloft. Once Zoloft started kicking in it got better. I know insomnia is a common side effect with starting so I’m sure it’ll clear up for you soon!,63

zao2nz,AutisticAdults,0,Just a vent about today.,5
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,1,I had s meltdown today and I feel like ass because of it. I’m home alone all day with no one to talk to but 4 animals who all love to make noise and demand attention. My parents’ dog follows me around and woofs at me if I try to sit alone in my room. My cat can’t be around the other cats and always wants the window open and thumps her tail repetitively against the glass if I don’t open it. My parents’ cat cries if I’m not with him (he doesn’t get along with my cat). I’m constantly overloaded by these animals and I have no energy or patience left to give them what they want. I feel terrible and sad about it but in thr moment I’m always just pissed because I’m so overwhelmed.,137
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,2,Today was already bad. I was trying to work on my social skills but it only made me feel guilty because I was doing well before everything happened and now it feels like I’m at square one. I’ve been trying to spend more time with my parents but I feel like they don’t enjoy my company very much.,58
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,3,I’ve never hit myself or anything during a meltdown but today was bad. My cat kept hitting the window with a very specific and repetitive noise and the dog wanted in my room and the other cats wanted in too and they were crying at my door and I just lost it.

zao9j3,mbti,7,"I studied cognitive functions during the summer, why?",8
zao9j3,mbti,8,How much and how do you know you’re te ni?,10
zao9j3,mbti,9,"Are you doubting me?? Jk I doubted myself too for some time. Not for te-fi because I think that’s very obvious to everyone, but I couldn’t decide between estj/entj. 90% of the time I really see the Ni-Se but then I’ll read something about Si to which I can relate to (rarely ever Ne but ig it makes sense cuz it would be tert?). However every time I read estj vs entj descriptions I always relate to the entj and rarely ever anything about the estj. I also have a dad with pretty high Si so I can really see how different we are. I try to study and understand better cognitive functions and stacks every day if I can, whenever I watch movies/read books I always try to notice what functions characters use, then check online and read the comments as a way of ”training the eye”. I have yet a lot to learn, though I believe I know enough to type myself (I have been called overconfident a few times tho so idk lmao). That doesn’t really answer your question but I don’t suppose you want me to describe everything I know about each cognitive function, right?",199
zao9j3,mbti,10,Yes maybe I do hahaha! Also tell me about si blindness I have studied this and very seriously for 3 years.,21
zao9j3,mbti,11,Well if you have then you should explain better what you mean bc I had never heard of it until you mentioned it just now. Are you talking about PoLR?,30
zao9j3,mbti,12,I am. I want you to explain it that confirms things more.,12
zao9j3,mbti,13,Right.. well like I said I don’t know anything about it yet so ig I can’t do that,18
zao9j3,mbti,14,"So maybe I should just type you afresh. It will help you out and you’d learn a lot. If you’re really what you think it will not hert you, if you’re not that will completely retype you.",37
zao9j3,mbti,15,"Sure I have no problem with that, but I am wondering why you’re having such a hard time answering my question. Also why are you so interested in helping me?",30
zao9j3,mbti,16,Because I want to help people find their type also type is much more complex then you have it there.,20
zao9j3,mbti,17,What are your hobbies and why? Please explain each as thoroughly as possible.,13
zao9j3,mbti,18,Also what do you do study or work? If you work what do you do for a living? Do you enjoy it and why? If you study instead what do you study and why do you study this? What is your favorite aspect of your studies? Why? Do you enjoy what you’re studying and why?,55

zaodev,relationship_advice,0,"My(26m) friends (23m 24m 27m) invited me to live with them, but changed up plans after I agreed",18
zaodev,relationship_advice,1,"Back in July I was last minute invited to come live with a group of friends, 5 people in a 4 bedroom because rent was too high. I agreed being told I would have a ground level room and since I have a parrot the sunlight is MUCH needed. Well the week before I moved my belongings one of the original housemates decided she (26f) was moving out and they filled the spot same day. Problem is the new person E (25m) got the room I was supposed to have and I was assigned the corner basement room. Apparently E and one of the housemates (D) are exes and D's current partner (F) does not want them on the same floor (But same house is ok?)",126
zaodev,relationship_advice,2,I have 3 massive artificial lights now for my bird because this room is so far underground there is no sunlight at all :(. I have to play bird videos instead of the birdfeeder I wanted to set up and I just feel so bad for him because he's in this dark basement alone.,54
zaodev,relationship_advice,3,"The group doesn't really seem to care and have explained to me that it's basically tough shit and drop it. I have, but the whole reason I chose to move here was because I was under the impression that I would have a good set up for my parrot.",49
zaodev,relationship_advice,4,"Now I feel that I sound unreasonable and ungrateful yea? Well E is never even home. 80% of the time the room is empty, he spends a lot of time at work and at his partners house and stays there overnight often. I get to look at this beautifully bright empty room every day.",54
zaodev,relationship_advice,5,I am really appreciative about being asked to move in but I am kinda mad that I was tossed aside like that. How should I proceed? I know I should just drop it but I keep feeling slighted about it.,40

zapbs4,NoFap,2,Keep going mann 70days you're a legend i just fapped now and i totally regret it so don't fell for porn it's a life killerrrr,25
zapbs4,NoFap,3,"Your balls hurting is called having blue balls. That happens when fluids (not semen, that's not stored in the balls) accumulate in your balls from being aroused and not releasing. It creates a pressure that hurts. Probably happened because you watched porn. Now you know why you shouldn't do that. The pain might go away on its own but I heard that applying cold helps, or doing squats with a lot of weight (warm your legs up first). Hope you manage. Also, motivation is great and makes things easier but real strength comes from discipline, i.e. being able to do the right thing even if you don't feel like it. So even if you release and don't feel motivated don't take that as an excuse to not do the work. Accept the fact that it just won't be as easy. Hope you manage to hang on and pass your exams!",150

zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,0,Was physically assaulted after being falsely accused by a bar of stealing a bag,14
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,1,Hiya so idk if it’s too late for me to take action but a few months ago I attended a friends birthday party at a bar/club.,26
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,2,"an incident occurred in which my friend (who I was living with at the time) had lost her bag in the bar after becoming incredibly intoxicated, because at the beginning of the night there was cctv footage of me carrying my friends bag for her to our table and I was the only coloured individual with the group the bouncers had assumed that I was a thief and proceeded to hold be in their back rooms for an hour and a half where 3 large men proceeded to intimate me insisting that it was not a racially profiled incident because the manager was black, as I didn’t know what was going on and couldn’t provide them with any information since I hadn’t stolen anything they proceeded to calm that they had thirty cctv footage of me looking through my friends bags and taking things however when I asked to be shown the footage it could not be provided I was eventually let go",163
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,3,"Unbeknownst to me while I was being held by security, there was another bouncer who had gone to my friend (who had lost her bag) and told her that he thought that I had mental health issues, that I was lying to her and that she should find better friends. So when I was eventually released and we all got in our lift to go home she brutally attacked me in the car ripping out clumps of my hair",79
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,4,"In the aftermath the next day she threw all of my things outside into the rain and filled my bags with her dogs poop before spitting on my things resulting in damages to various expensive pieces of technology and I had most of my clothing ruined by the damp, She made various TikTok’s that she eventually took down boasting about the way she had attacked me and she has crippled my social life as she has told anyone that will listen that I’m not a good person and that I’m a thief despite the fact that i was all a misunderstanding and her bad was found in the end with everything still in it",114
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,5,"My life now is a shell of what I used to be, I rally go out because In my small town I am almost always met with dirty looks of comments from individuals who believe the false accusations made against me and I was just hoping that someone on this platform might know of something I can do to Clear my name and get the justice I deserved 🙏🏾",69
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,6,Also sorry if there’s lots of spelling mistakes my phone is playing up today ☺️,15

zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,27,So you’ve had numerous crimes committed against you here that you should go to the police about.,17
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,28,The first is false imprisonment. The line between citizens arrest and false imprisonment is that obviously debatable but they’ve gone far over it in this case because:,27
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,29,- The crime is not serious.,6
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,30,- There is little evidence you did it. You didn’t have the bag on you.,15
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,31,"- They held you for an hour and a half. You’re only supposed to hold someone until the police arrive. Obviously the police would have arrived much sooner than that or the police would have told them to let you go. Clearly they didn’t even ring the police which means it doesn’t count as a citizens arrest, just false imprisonment.",60
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,32,You should go to the police over this.,8
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,33,You can also put in a civil claim for damages against the company which could give you significant compensation. You’ll probably need a lawyer to pursue a civil claim but may be able to get no win no fee.,39
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,34,You can also get their security licences taken away.,9
unknown,unknown,0,Secondly assault. You roommate physically assaulted you. This is a crime. Go to the police and present whatever evidence you have. If you saved her TikToks admitting it it will be an open and shut case (though will still take a long time.),43
unknown,unknown,1,"Thirdly, damaging your stuff. This is criminal damage. Again go to the police with your evidence.",16
unknown,unknown,2,"Lastly the reputational damage. You do have a case that you’ve been lied about and had your reputation damage however pursing such a case through the Courts would be very expensive for you and may be very difficult. My advice would be that once you go to the police you go on social media and tell your side of the story publicly. As long as you tell the truth there should be no legal problems for you in doing this. Name the people involved, name and shame the companies. Lots of people will believe you and sympathise with you. I instantly believed you. The higher ups at the company will probably investigate. Your roommate may attack you again but you will have defenders on your side now and she’s actually likely to say something that incriminates her again.",138
unknown,unknown,3,Hope that helps.,3
zappoq,petco,0,Dog Training Area,3
zappoq,petco,1,People always get mad when I move stuff out of my way or away from my DT Kiosk and idk if its happened to anyone else. We are a small store and the donation bin we use is right next to my kiosk and I wanted to decorate but it was in the way and i had gotten the OK from my GM to move it but one of the other managers got mad? Im talking with my gm about it but does anyone have any similar experiences / what did you do?,93
zappoq,petco,2,You have a donation bin? We were told to get rid of ours due to the unions (weird),18
zappoq,petco,3,"But in response to your question- if your GM is fine with it what the other managers say really doesn’t matter in the long run (coming from the CAL/SEL) It’s not like you got rid of the donation bin, only moved it. If it’s still within sight and reach you didn’t do anything wrong",54
zappoq,petco,4,Yea move that shit,4
zappoq,petco,5,"My DT's training area is their personal space and they are free to do whatever they want to it to make it appealing to them, the pet parents and of course the pets.",33
zappoq,petco,6,The other managers keep putting shut in front of my ring and my display and I literally just move it out of the way and spitefully put it all in front of the register so that way they HAVE to deal with it.,43
zappoq,petco,7,"It was a certain thing that didnt fit in the donation bin, our manager fights our dgm for it (lol) but it was a stand for a cockatiel cage that was literally rught under the kiosk. The people who showcase the cats here didn't take it so i just wanted it out of the way and they were saying its fine there but it's literally my only spot where i can put the kiosk",74
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,0,Current state of wrestling magazines (Pro Wrestling Illustrated etc.)?,9
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,1,"As a kid I was a big fan of PWI and their family of magazines, and would also occasionally end up with one from the George Napolitano publications (theirs were kind of a sloppier, pulpier version of the Apter mags). It was really common to see them at grocery store or drugstore newsstands, all-ages bookstores, etc. back in the late '80s and early '90s.",64
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,2,"I know that Pro Wrestling Illustrated still exists, because the PWI 500 gets talked up on social media every year (if nothing else) but it's been a few years since I've actually seen one at a store (I think Walgreens was the last one?) I know it's not novel to say that print media's been in steep decline for awhile, so it's impressive that PWI is still around at all, but I was curious and figured someone on here probably still bought/read them semi-regularly.",84
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,3,I guess my main questions are:,6
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,4,"1. Is PWI the last one standing, or do they still publish other titles? As mentioned, I've seen PWI for sale at stores a few times in recent years, but I can't remember the last time I saw any other wrestling magazine. From the ""Apter mags"" family or otherwise.",49
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,5,"2. Do they still more or less try to keep kayfabe in their stories? I know on one hand that might seem foolish in the internet age, when there's probably no full-on ""marks"" left of any age, but if they can't compete with the internet (online dirtsheets included) in terms of news and up-to-the-minute commentary, I can see how they might decide to just pick a lane and keep up a winking suspension of disbelief.",75

zapwhj,SquaredCircle,8,So I recently got the PWI 500 magazine and I was rather happy with my purchase. I don’t know of other magazines really. But I liked the product enough that I bought a subscription.,34
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,9,I live with my 68 year old Great uncle who was following wrestling with his dad my great grandfather as kid reading the magazines and stuff. It did still present itself as a kayfabe magazine.,35
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,10,But the big reason for me I got it to connect with an old school fan. And it worked. We’re looking forward to the next issues.,26

zaqm2o,legaladvice,1,"Hi,",1
zaqm2o,legaladvice,2,"I lived in Missouri some time ago and made my internet payments directly through the landlord included in Rent since the internet was a bundle they had with ATT. Though the online account had my email and name, it always showed $0 and no usage as that was reported to my landlord. When I moved out, I asked my landlord if I was responsible for returning the equipment, or I leave it in the apartment for the next person, and they told me to leave it and they'll take care of it. I got notification months later from ATT saying that I didn't return my equipment. I called the landlord, they were going to return. Never did, so I got ATT sent the debt to a debt collection agency.",129

zaruvo,relationship_advice,0,How do I help my fiancé understand the importance of his personal brand/communication during interviews without over-stepping?,17
zaruvo,relationship_advice,1,"Alright, friends--this is a doozy! My fiancé has been trying to break into a new field at nearly 40 years old after 2 decades in the service industry. He's so smart and creative and great, but he really doesn't have any professional career experience at all.",46
zaruvo,relationship_advice,2,"I overheard him talking to a interview panel and I'm starting to understand why he has been having trouble. He says ""um"" almost an awkward amount, but he doesn't even talk like that in real life. He also sounds incredibly stern and serious with none of his great and funny personality shining through. And, the worst part is that he is constantly smacking his lips! Like, where did that even come from?! It's like he becomes a different person when he's being interviewed. The hiring manager asked him what he's looking to do and what his goals are and he didn't have an answer prepared.",105
zaruvo,relationship_advice,3,"My fiancé is genuinely one of the smartest people I've ever met. I really don't get this. I don't want to overstep and I don't want to be overbearing or knock his confidence, but I have several years experience hiring and managing people and I wouldn't hire someone who came across like that in an interview. He's getting in his own way and I don't know what to do or how to bring it up to him without making him feel bad. Help!",83

zaruvo,relationship_advice,14,"Looking for a job is almost a skill set in and of itself. When I went through an agency's course about five years ago, one of things they had us do was write down the questions that might normally be expected on an interview. Then we did practices with one another so that in a real interview we would be comfortable with our answers. Do you think he might be receptive to do something like this with you or a close friend?",82
zaruvo,relationship_advice,15,"Hi. I’m like your fiancé when it comes to being interviewed. I can write a killer resume and cover letter, so I usually land an interview, but the don’t get offered the job. I am always SO NERVOUS when it comes time for the interview. I haven’t gone job hunting in years because of this fear and I don’t like my current job. I just don’t believe I can appear capable. Maybe this helps as a different perspective",78
zaruvo,relationship_advice,16,Offer to give him practice interviews,6
zaruvo,relationship_advice,17,"Since you have expertise in the hiring process, I would casually offer him help practicing and/or tips. But I wouldn't mention ""because I saw your interview and you are terrible"", more like ""since you are going through something I am knowledgeable in"".",42
zaruvo,relationship_advice,18,It sounds like he has not asked for help.,9
zaruvo,relationship_advice,19,"First of all does he think he has a problem? Second does he want help/get feedback so he recognizes he has a problem? Third, does he want help from you?",30
zaruvo,relationship_advice,20,Get the first question answered first.,6
zaruvo,relationship_advice,21,It sounds like he has anxiety. Lip smacking/mouth wetting is a sign of nervousness. Offer to do mock interviews with him.,21
zaruvo,relationship_advice,22,"Interviewing is a skill that needs to be practiced to get good at it, just like any skill. There’s this interview technique called STAR that he needs to look up. It’s basically like, hey here’s an example of a situation I faced, how I faced it, and what the results were. If he has 10 examples like this and practices/memorizes them, that will help a lot with his confidence. Also, he can look up the most common STAR interview questions and make sure he has examples for each one. I created a spreadsheet and read over it before any interview, just to center myself. For the non stop Ums, you might try recording him during an interview so he can actually hear himself. If you think this would backfire, he can put a little note next to his camera that says No Ums! I did this and it actually helps. The best thing you can do for him is help him with these different tricks so he gains confidence. See if he’ll do mock interviews with you that can can record so he can hear himself and work on fixing issues.",191
zaruvo,relationship_advice,23,"I swear I could have written this post. My fiancé has been job hunting for months and has great experience in his field and a nice resume and he lands multiple interviews a week. But he has yet to be offered a position and I’m almost 100% positive it’s because of how he comes across in interviews. He has a lot of interview anxiety but he tries too hard to play it cool and comes off as disinterested. I’ve tried to encourage him to show his personality and make an attempt to make a personal connection with the interviewer, but he says he likes his method. I’m trying so hard to not damage his confidence but he is also his own biggest problem",123
zaruvo,relationship_advice,24,"I don't see a way for you to bring this up with your fiancé without knocking his confidence, and I think you should leave the overall topic alone until he potentially comes to you for feedback on his own initiative.",40
zaruvo,relationship_advice,25,"If he does come to you by himself, even if only to just vent about unsuccessful interviews, you can remind him of your hiring and managing experience and offer to go over his CV with him and give him some pointers for future interviews.",44
zaruvo,relationship_advice,26,"However, even then, I think you should keep your observations to yourself and just offer good tips based on your own experience. I'm sure you mean well, but I don't think the rest is really for you to judge. You overheard him talking to an interview panel, but you probably weren't supposed to. You're not his hiring agent or manager. You're his girlfriend; your role in this constellation is different and your criticism would likely have an entirely different impact than you intend it.",84
zaruvo,relationship_advice,27,Offer to practice interviews with him. I failed at my first interview because no one told me how to interview and I was way too casual and familiar and nervous,30
zaruvo,relationship_advice,28,"I’d say hey I saw a really great YouTube or TikTok about interviewing it made me think about your job hunt. Then 1 give him some external resources, there a ton of great ones on YouTube. Then 2 say they suggest roleplaying an interview and ask if he’d be interested in doing that with you. If he says no leave it alone if he says yes I’d role-play some of the open ended questions that are most typical and at the end ask if he’d like your feedback or constructive criticism then bring up the things you notice.",98
zaruvo,relationship_advice,29,"I don’t think there’s anything wrong with helping your partner or wanting them to have their best qualities shine. My partner and I have always helped each other study, done flash cards, role-played for interviews. It’s so helpful to get out the nervous energy.",44
zaruvo,relationship_advice,30,Wait. You have experience in recruitment and didn’t even help him practice!? Wha?,13
zaruvo,relationship_advice,31,"Help him practice. For my last job, I put in the work for the interview: googled common interview questions, and researched the company, and practiced the interview over the phone with friends and on camera. That’s what it takes. It isn’t that he lacks the skills as to why he isn’t getting hired it’s that he sounds really unprepared.",59
zaruvo,relationship_advice,32,He is your fiancé. Eventually he'll be your husband. Just talk straight with him. It's not what you say. It's how you say it. Keep it positive and constructive. Be supportive and understanding.,33
zaruvo,relationship_advice,33,"Let him try and fail on his own. If he vents about it or expresses that it’s not going how he wants, then you can offer to help without letting him know how bad he was when you listened in.",40
zaruvo,relationship_advice,34,Tell him it's from a place of love then be honest; it'll be hard to hear but necessary.,18
zaruvo,relationship_advice,35,I say this for someone who has had countless career jumps and needs slapping down more.,16
zaruvo,relationship_advice,36,Practice during sexy time. If he fails the question then you show him how to answer it. It's a great way to help him build confidence.,26
zaruvo,relationship_advice,37,He's trying to not get a job.,7
zaruvo,relationship_advice,38,Jk. Idk.. But hope you figure it out because that's a delicate issue to try and address.,17
zaruvo,relationship_advice,39,"Yeah, it's tough because I think most people get really nervous for interviews. To be honest, I have even taken a beta blocker beforehand because I was so jittery. Over the years, I've developed a running list of questions I've either been asked or anticipated being asked and the responses to gonwith them. I usually go over those about 5 times, so I have them in my head but am not over rehearsed. I've even recorded myself asking the questions and filmed myself answering them to get used to it. I think you should go for it if you want to apply to other jobs! Each interview is practice so that even if you don't get a job, you're prepared when the right one comes along!",126
zaruvo,relationship_advice,40,"It definitely takes practice to do, I usually have to rehearse my answers for it to come out smoothly. I have to do it every time otherwise I become awkward again lol! It definitely doesn't come naturally.",37
zaruvo,relationship_advice,41,"If you can get someone to do practice interviews with you, they can be loads of help. (Though it always feels cringy lmao)",23
zaruvo,relationship_advice,42,There is a website called UNIVERSAL CLASS (free through public libraries) that has a course about job interviews. One whole lesson is about practicing for a job interview.,28
zaruvo,relationship_advice,43,This! You don't have to tell him that you actually saw/heard him. When he tells you that he wasn't hired after the interview give some general advice how to handle a job interview. And without him knowing address the problems he seems to be having,45
zaruvo,relationship_advice,44,"Propanolol is actually being marketed on FB as a ""performance "" medication for interviews and public speaking. It's a beta blocker. I take it for tachycardia/rapid heartbeat. I mean it does lower your racing heart and that calms you. I think in his case it's a matter of being out of practice in ""selling himself."" My exhusband had similar trouble decades ago when trying to switch fields. Years later after our divorce he YouTube researched ""how to"" interviews and common questions asked. He has now nailed several very very important awesome jobs. He's a pro at interviews cuz we're roommates now and I hear him on zooms.",107
zaruvo,relationship_advice,45,I hate rehearsing them too 🤣 but you’re right,9
zasei9,autism,0,Are there any polite ways to ask/tell neurotypicals to not sit next to you?,14
zasei9,autism,1,"So I’m a college student and find a nice quiet spot to sit alone, and there are plenty of other empty seats, but the neurotypicals always choose to sit in the spot next to me for whatever reason.

zasei9,autism,2,My experience has been that most university students are pretty chill about it.,13
zasei9,autism,3,"I usually say something along the lines of ""uh, I'm sorry could you please sit somewhere else I'm having a much harder time focusing if there's someone next to me"" at that point they usually at least freeze and I follow up with ""thank you I really appreciate it :) "" and now they'd need to be a major dick to still sit next to you but mostly they just say no problem and move on.",76
zasei9,autism,4,I'm very much a people pleaser so this was hard for me but beeing a people pleaser I'm also super nice and grateful about it automatically so people rarely mind.,30
zasei9,autism,5,"""Hi, I'm hoping a friend might be able to drop by, do you mind leaving that seat free?""",18
zasei9,autism,6,Put some stuff there and say “sorry I need extra space for my stuff could you sit in the next table” (usually they will leave just a seat).,28
zasei9,autism,7,An alternative “one of my friend may come can you leave it”.,12
zasei9,autism,8,"Even “I would prefer to have some space since there are free spot, I don’t like crow place” it is fine.",21
zasei9,autism,9,"Of course only if there are other free place left in the room. Also it depends on the place, I would advise to leave the first/second line. Many people who do not ear or see well seat there so if the only spot available is the one near you in those row they may not move.",56
zasei9,autism,10,I stopped being polite. I pick my stuff up and move. They were kind of rude to crowd me in the first place honestly.,24
zasei9,autism,11,"My problem is that I don’t want to upset people or make them feel bad, so I haven’t said anything to them about it yet.",25
zasei9,autism,12,sprawl out and put your feet up on one chair and then your bag on the chair next to you,20
zasei9,autism,13,"The old classic ""Sorry, that seats reserved for my bag"" trick should work. Especially if you don't like lying... most of the time...",23

zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,0,Any advice on the dog that pulls?,7
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,1,"I'm watching a dog that I've watched for a year and a 1/2 now, on and off. She always pulls, because her owners don't do anything about it. They just let her go wherever she wants, and they follow. I hate it. And I have talked to them about it multiple times, they just say thank you and they'll try but it's obvious that haven't.",65
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,2,"I shorten the leash so she's next to me, I give her a treat when she sits next to me, I do everything I've read about, and she doesn't stop. It's gotten to the point where she will pull so hard, that I have to yank on the leash to bring her back. And that seems to make her defiant and do it even more.",65
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,3,"Among other training errors, this is making me seriously consider not wanting to continue our relationship. But the owners are nice, and they treat me well. It's just the dog that is starting to wear on my nerves",38
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,4,[deleted],1
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,5,"I carry my own training harnesses to manage dogs who have leash issues, including pulling. Just check with the owner that it’s ok to use your own harness - I use a PetSafe 3-in-1 in three sizes.",37
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,6,Get a harness with a front clip or a gentle leader (head collar.) You have to get owners approval. That will curb the bad habits quickly,26
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,7,You got yourself and the dog into a feed back loop. You both are pulling each other more and more because you're both not getting what you need in the walk. The dog is pulling more and darting/lunging quicker because to them that's the only way to get more freedom. Less freedom for the dog doesn't mean less pulling and often it just means whoever is stronger pulls harder.,69
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,8,"Walking right next to another entity, dog or human, isn't really natural for dogs. Roaming, zigzagging, and sniffing it how dogs naturally walk. And all thought those are often connected to pulling, pulling is not required for a dog to do those things. A dog can learn or be trained to walk in a heel position but that requires consistent association to reinforcement. Reinforcement can be many things, treats, access for, praise, removal of unpleasant stimuli, and or play (pre-mac principal.) There are benefits and downsides to different reinforcement methods. And it really depends what the dog cares about the most in the moment. If squirrels and smelling is way more important than treats using treats during walks is going to be inefficient.",123
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,9,"Additionally dogs don't generalize training to different handlers easily. Even if the pet parents started training and were diligent, you would not see an effect for some time.",28
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,10,"My recommendation and suggestion for you is to either decline walking them, or work on better walking communication between you and the dog. Not every dog works well with every persons walking style and vice versa. I would recommend looking into loose leash walking methods. I walk many dogs that just need a little more space to roam, safely, to then start actually paying attention to where I wanted to walk.",71
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,11,I have a doggo like this and unfortunately has a pace maker so cannot use anything around his neck so he wears a harness.,24
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,12,"I use a lead that has a little pull elastic in it, I think it’s a no pull lead. When we’re out walking I usually figure if 8 back and forth up and down my garden. He is much better with me but because of his pace maker I’ve had to put in the work as I’m not as confident to let him pull.",64
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,13,Patience is a virtue unfortunately but perhaps make the owners aware of the harm it does to you physically also and how you don’t know if you can continue without some co operation.,33
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,14,"Like previous people have said try a harness with the owner's approval. Use treats. Get her attention on you before you go on the walk. Have her sit, look at you. Maybe do a few recalls, anything to kind of get her calmed down and more focused on you than the walk. Even if it's just for a moment it will help during the walk.",65

zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,18,"*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/RoverPetSitting) if you have any questions or concerns.*",24
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,19,"Not sure how quickly the dog will learn, but with my clients who do this, as soon as they pull too hard I stop walking completely. Usually the dog is like ??? When there's slack we keep going. Most dogs figure it out enough that walking with me specifically + pulling = not going anywhere. It's not a long term solution but it'll save you some pulled muscles.",68
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,20,Get the lead that pulls from the front of the dog as others have mentioned.,15
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,21,"Training takes a lot of repetition. Every time the dog pulls on the lead I stop. I walk forward when they are calm and praise them. If they pull again I stop. And again and again. You have to continue this even if it takes a long time and they start to realise they don't go anywhere unless they stop pulling. But for the time restrictions of walking on Rover and your main purpose being to exercise the dog not train it, I would opt for the lead if the owners approve.",92
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,22,"I swear by Weiss walkie leashes. My own dogs are horrible pullers on walks and they still pull, but it does lessen it a lot more than any other leash we've tried. I use it on one of my regulars too (with permission) and she pulls so much less!",49
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,23,"Unfortunately, there's not a lot else you can do without the owner's approval. I would recommend having another very serious conversation with the owners where you essentially say, ""Look, if you don't do something about this - such as hiring a trainer or purchasing tools like a prong collar - I will be terminating this relationship as it has gotten completely out of hand."" And if they don't do anything, follow through on it and terminate the relationship.",78
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,24,See if owners would be interested in getting a prong or gentle leader. I've seen the gentle leaders work magic with pullers!,22
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,25,"My dog used to pull and the only thing that helped was lots and lots of leash corrections. What I do is slightly tug the leash or just allow the dog to catch the end of the leash and then head in the opposite direction. Eventually she got the idea that the only way to actually move forward on the walk is to stay by me. I had to accept the fact that I might not get very far physically during the walk, but my dog is usually still pretty worn out from having to pay attention to what she is doing. Overall it can take a lot of effort to break a pulling habit, but might be worth it in the long run if you plan to see the dog on a continual basis.",135
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,26,"I can handle her since she's a smaller dog, it's just the biggest issue for me is walking. One time, we passed by someone, and they said, ""Who's walking who?"" which was embarrassing.",33
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,27,"She also sometimes doesn't listen, which is weird bc she used to be good abt it before. I'm not sure what's happened, maybe bc she's almost 3, and these behaviors have set in with her owners, and I handle it differently. Our she doesn't like my style.",47
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,28,"I told them she's not listening to me as much, and they just said it was weird since she listens to them. Maybe it's a respect thing?",27
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,29,But i see your point. I wonder if charging more would make it worth it.,15
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,30,"Thank you for the recommendation, I will see what they say. Her harness now has no front clip, so I think that also contributes. I always use the front clip with other dogs who pull or are leash aggressive.",39
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,31,"Thank you, I will talk to them.",7
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,32,"Thank you for the suggestion, I hadn't heard of loose leash walking. I will research and try it.",18
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,33,"I see the dog almost every month for housesitting. These ppl got a dog in covid, hadn't had a dog since they were young, and they'd only had cats. And it'd been like 10 years since they had any pets.",40
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,34,"Now that everything's been lifted, they travel as often as they used to before the dog. Once or twice a month, for at least 5 days. I'm currently almost done with a 3-week stay. And they leave for another trip next week 🙃",43
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,35,They canceled two long trips next year bc they're realizing they don't want to leave their dog so often... it's the classic covid dog issues that we all hear and read abt.,32
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,36,"And the jumping when on walks omg. I've walked other dogs in their neighborhood, and when I come across them, sue jumps to see me, and the owners barely stop it. I always try, and they get the hint to stop her.",42
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,37,[deleted],1
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,38,>I wonder if charging more would make it worth it.,10
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,39,Know your worth girl. I think we have all gone through a phase of really horrible dogs for the sake of building up clientele lol. Growing your business also means making hard choices that will put you ahead not behind.,40
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,40,What if that really well trained Labrador down the street needs walking while you're waisting time with Little Miss Yanks My Arm Off? It's hard to let go of bad relationships but you would be making way for better business opportunities. It's that or up the rate to make it worth your while. The whole point of Rover is the ability to do what you love. Good luck!,68
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,41,"Omg I walk a dog with a front clip harness and he will use it to drag me *backward*. He’s not obese since I’ve been walking him almost daily for a few months, so he’s not as bad now, but trust me when I say: any lead can suck with the wrong dog! 😂",54
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,42,"I’m currently doing drop ins with a 9 month old puppy who wasn’t trained (so much biting and jumping and pulling at the meet and greet) and after the first drop-in, I brought my dog’s extra Halti (like a gentle leader), because this puppy’s normal collar fits weird (it slides down her neck and gives her a lot of leverage to choke herself 😞). She clearly hated it at first, but wow, so much less pulling, because it’s easier to get her to notice with even a little tension at the top of her neck (that’s the most important thing), and she’ll let up on the leash. If I had a slip lead, I’d prefer that for her (the portion around her muzzle annoys her, and she is very easy to train, so she really just needs biofeedback—even a martingale collar would do wonders), but I don’t recommend slip leads to everyone, because there’s a steep learning curve (though I really like them as a general use training leash).",169
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,43,"The best advice I have that isn’t tool-based (because imo, people do expect too much from the tool vs how you use it): pull up, not back, on the leash for pullers. You want better biofeedback for pullers, and that means higher on the neck—both safer for them and less annoying for you.",53
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,44,Or you can just say you’re more comfortable using a harness and just make sure it has a front clip. A gentle leader will require way more training bc the dogs hate wearing it on their head in the beginning and most owners will think the head collar is hurting their pet(from my experience.),54
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,45,Yep I am very familiar with Covid puppies! Loose leash walking is a broad term and there are different styles. But the main factor is the leash is not what's controlling the dog. The leash is just a secondary safety.,40
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,46,"Covid puppies are prone to overstimulation or over arousal that causes zoomies and over excitement behavior. Doing a snaifari, decompression, or mental exercise is really good for them. Here is a video of a sniffari. (I am not familiar with this company/group. Literally just did a search for sniffari example.)",50
unknown,unknown,0,You don't have to have a long leash it just has to be long enough that it doesn't get tight when they are roaming.,24
unknown,unknown,1,Additionally if you see them do these signs,8
unknown,unknown,0,"and or shakeouts, their behavior maybe from stress, or over stimulation.",11
unknown,unknown,1,"Oh, completely agree. They likely wouldn't even get a herm-springer or a properly fitted prong.",15
unknown,unknown,2,Thanks. I appreciate the comment. My sister said the same thing lol.,12
unknown,unknown,3,"It's surprising bc she's been good before, so I assume it's the owners that have either encouraged whatever behavior (their neighbor said hi but she didn't want the dog to come to her bc [owner] can't control her when she jumps), or the dog just doesn't like me as kuch as before.",52
unknown,unknown,4,"You're right tho, I have been picking up more business that is closer to where I live, and these ppl are further away. It sucks driving more than I'd like.",30
unknown,unknown,5,"The video you posted is, at the very least, from an certified fear-free trainer and behavior consultant. Her information is right in line with other such accredited professionals.",28
unknown,unknown,6,"My most regular client was a puller. In addition to loose leash walking training I also got permission from her owner to use a long line for her walks. Now that she gets to spend 50-75% of her walks making her own choices and smelling just about anything she wants her owner has told me she's become a loose leash champ when being walked by her family (this is still a relative term, she still pulls sometimes, but far less than she used to). She's still on a front-clip harness unless we're in a big open area, otherwise I do a lot of active management of the long line. My gear is a 15' biothane long line by Viper, which stays stink-free and has durable brass hardware.",127
unknown,unknown,7,"As someone who has had to educate clients on prongs, they definitely won't. I worked with a trainer using one for my husky mix who was a notorious puller so I know my way around them. Had one lab drag its owner across my front yard when getting dropped off the first time, the prong was a necklace. Loose and down around the base of the neck, not doing a damn thing. Thankfully he was receptive on pick-up when I offered to show him how to properly fit it, and where it should rest, etc. When she was dropped off the next time it was still correctly fitted! Though she still dragged him across the yard....because he had switched to using a flexi-lead ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) There's only so much I'm willing to put the energy into fixing and since this dog was happy with just yard time I let it go.",150

zax6j5,mentalhealth,0,"I’m a really dependent person, and I hate myself for it.",11
zax6j5,mentalhealth,1,"I feel like I’m the most dependent person in the world, I can’t function by myself anymore. Sometimes when I lie awake at night I sit in my head, and wonder if everything I’ve told myself is a lie. Has orange always been my favorite color, or is it because it was my dad’s favorite color. Have I always hated pink starbursts or is it because it was your favorite and I was happy to give it to you. Did I never tell anyone for years what happened, or is it because I never wanted to believe you did it and would rather think I made it up in my head. Was my favorite flavor lemon, or was it because you never wanted the lemon flavored candy. My hobbies depended on whatever you liked, and I’d research it for hours, just to talk to you about it. Everything I did depended on who I was closest to. If they were happy I was content. But when they were upset I couldn’t give them space, I felt like if they were away I’d lose them forever. I couldn’t stop talking and saying sorry even when I wasn’t wrong, because I just can’t go without talking. I can’t go without hearing an I love you or an I’m not mad at you, just please don’t be mad at me. My mom accidentally texted me and said I was being a bitch, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe, and I couldn’t stop the tears. I got homeschooled because I felt like everyone hated me, because one person didn’t like me. I couldn’t deal with not having at least one person constantly with me. I couldn’t be alone, why can’t I ever just be content alone. I have to have someone all the time, I don’t need them to take care of me, I just need someone to feel like I exist. When I’m alone I can’t exist as a person, I feel lost. I put everything into one person, I just have to have one person. I put everything on hold for them, I live and breathe for them. I know it isn’t right, I can admit it but I just can’t fix it no matter how hard I try. I don’t know how I feel, someone has to feel for me. I wonder if I’m crazy, or if others feel this way too. I just can’t be alone, and I don’t mean I have to be dating someone, it can be my mother, my sibling, or a friend even, it’s not in a romantic way, I just have to have someone. Am I crazy?",443

zax6j5,mentalhealth,4,"I have experienced this. The word for it is codependency if you are willing to accept that label. I've often wondered the same about my preferences, but it goes deeper than that. It's looking for feedback and emotional healing from those around you rather than trusting yourself. Could have a lot to do with self-esteem, trauma and emotional abuse like in my case or you could have completely different causes. My point is, find out what those things are and address them. This is not an easy thing to work on, but you can do it. There are a lot of materials, books, and groups around these issues. If you need direct links, just ask. Hoping everything works out for you.",121

zax6j5,mentalhealth,7,"But I think that's just a part of being human, we grow up depending on one another to figure things out, we end up mimicking things others do and pouring hours into similar hobbies that they like.

I think who we are as individuals is a mix of all the people were close to and attach ourselves to.",87
zax6j5,mentalhealth,8,"I don't think you're crazy, I can relate to the anxiety of people not liking you and the paranoia of the world hating you. It sucks, but there are people around you who are obviously supporting you (like your mom and siblings,) and if you want to start a journey of being less dependant then I think you can talk to them about it and let them guide you (counterintuitive bc you need to depend on them to help you be more independent but I think it's okay)",88
zax6j5,mentalhealth,9,"Whilst there's a lot to say, perhaps this may help most. You say you put everything into one person, make that person yourself. It's your life and you're living with yourself until the end, no one else will be doing that. Be single and learn to love yourself",48

I feel like this comes with the fact that my emotins are so tied to thise around me and IÍm dependent upon their happiness. I hate it but <I also donńt know how to change.,89
zax6j5,mentalhealth,12,Try do figure out what you like. You have to learn to like being around your self more somehow. Play a video game you are interested in or explore something you may like,33
zax6j5,mentalhealth,13,"I have cptsd from sexual and emotional abuse, and I thought maybe it stemmed from it. I went to an advocacy center as a kid and they told me it was minor DID symptoms, but people I’ve talked to who have DID experience symptoms completely different than me. I feel misdiagnosed.

zax6j5,mentalhealth,14,Thank you❤️❤️,2
zax6j5,mentalhealth,15,"Awesome! Same! I think DID is unlikely just statistically. I definitely qualify for a dissociative diagnosis though, which maybe you have experienced. That includes flashbacks and out of body experiences or a state of complete confusion where you can't center yourself in your identity and whether reality is present or you're in a dream. For me that part can be really scary. I'm saying all this because working on my codependency has really helped with the anxiety that causes a cascading effect of other symptoms.

zaxht7,AskDocs,1,"My son had a strep and double ear infection one month ago. Had him on amoxicillin for 2 days before he lost it and refused to take it anymore (ADHD)- his symptoms improved so we regrettably let it slide. He came home yesterday not feeling well, had a temp of 101.7 and there was swelling near the back of his right jaw and under his right ear. This morning, still had a temp of 101, swelling, and complained of ear pain- started him back on amoxicillin last night (new script from an NP I work with). Gave him Tylenol around 7am today, no fever or pain as of now (3pm), but that area is swollen, red l, and warm to the touch. He said his teeth don't hurt at all and he just had a dental check up 3 weeks ago. Was going to wait until tomorrow to see how it is before we rank up more bills at urgent care, but I'm worried about the swelling. Could this be caused by an ear infection or more serious, like something residual from strep? He is fully vaccinated, was panicking about mumps when I first saw him yesterday.

1000qw9,whiskey,1,I have been mostly quiet for the year but for the last quarter i have spent almost $700 on whiskies. I think that is a bit too much if you ask me and it is only for my personal consumption. Although this would probably last me for a good while. Happy New Year everybody!,54
1000qw9,whiskey,2,"This sounds like a set up. Ii think you might be my wife. The gig is up honey, I know its you. Like I told you before, all these bottles are really hard to find and they were only like $100 for all of them.",45

1000qw9,whiskey,15,I am pleading the fifth on this one,8
1000qw9,whiskey,16,About 3k. But half of that is because I buy for my neighborhood cigar and bourbon group which spends about $150 a month on cigars and $150 on cigars.,29

Like full on Dale Gribble conspiracy theorist levels of insane, but I could not let this sweet girl get taken advantage of.",117

You can't figure that out unless the workers talk to each other and find the pattern.",74

1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,19,"We had good chuckle about the ""sexism"" in my office the other day. Every male who works for the company has a company truck. None of the females have any kind of company vehicle at all. Seems sexist on the surface. But we are an industrial service company and every technician is male (literally never had a female apply for a tech position). Every office support person is female, with the exception of the president of the company.",78
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,20,"Just because you uncover a ""pattern"" doesn't mean there isn't a legitimate reason for it. There may be illegitimate reasons, and those should be addressed. But don't be too quick to jump to conclusions.",34
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,21,"If they only hire men as technicians, and only hire women as office workers, that is most definitely a strong sign of a sexist hiring pattern. What legitimate reason is there for that? There are strong gender biases in both professions but an unbiased hiring process would reflect the actual gender percentages of the professions, not an absolute monolith. For both professions it's about 75% dominated by one gender, so what happened to the 25% of applicants that are the ""wrong"" gender? Why do they not make up 25% of your workforce?",92
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,22,"Now, I once flunked algebra in high school… but how do you hire women when 100% of your applicants are male?",21
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,23,"You don't, but again, 25% of technicians are women. If you get zero female applicants for a technician position rather than 25% that indicates a bias in the hiring/application process or perhaps some kind of external factor like a poor company reputation. This isn't so bad in its own and might just be random coincidence but not when it happens twice in one workplace. That's pushing the bounds of believability. Note also that he only specifies that for the technician position- men *do* apply for office positions, but don't ever get hired. Why could that be? When this is a company-wide problem rather than a departmental one that points to a problem with the company culture, likely sexism.",118
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,24,"Overall, just weird to notice the issue but laugh it off instead of pursuing it further.",16
1001lb0,WorkersStrikeBack,25,"Yeah.... If I had one female applicant for a tech position, she would be given the same consideration as a male applicant. This isn't a phenomenon isolated to one company. I've been in the industrial service industry my entire adult life (I'm 41, so that's about 23 years in the industry) and have worked for a number of different companies, in different parts of the country. It's the same everywhere. Females tend not to apply for Technician positions. The strange this is (or maybe not so stramge) that this disparity doesn't seem to bother the female support staff we have. They are not in the least bit concerned with the lack of female representation amongst the service techs. The only people concerned are outside the industry, which really baffles me.",130

1001q6c,FanFiction,0,How to Promote a fanfic without coming off as annoying,10
1001q6c,FanFiction,1,"So I've been writing my fic for over a year now and while I don't post constantly I make sure to post once a month or so, maybe sooner. I've made it to the front page of my relatively small FFN crossover list and I've essentially hit a wall of readers.",51
1001q6c,FanFiction,2,"While I enjoy the story that I'm writing, my motivation usually waxes and wanes based on how much attention my story gets (also, is that normal?) I also want to get more readers and people to view the story.",39
1001q6c,FanFiction,3,"At the same time, I don't want to spread my story around like a struggle rapper with his mixtapes; how would I gain more readers in a natural, acceptable and tolerable way without being annoying?",35
1001q6c,FanFiction,4,"You can join Discord servers, subreddits or other communities for fanfic readers and writers in the fandom. Pay attention to any requests people might make (i.e. ""I want to read about X character""), and share your work if it fits the request. Talk about what you're writing if it's appropriate to the conversation. However, you should obviously engage with other people in the community for purposes other than self-promotion.",69
1001q6c,FanFiction,5,I think it's normal for your motivation to fluctuate with your engagement levels. It doesn't make you weak or inferior to writers who don't care as much about external validation.,30
1001q6c,FanFiction,6,There are a couple of things you can do that aren't super in your face.,15
1001q6c,FanFiction,7,first the more sites you post on the more folks can read your work but it can bug you if your wanting all your readers centralized in one spot.,29
1001q6c,FanFiction,8,"Second talk about your fic in appropriate context, fandom discussions about fanfic, on your social media and participate in review exchanges and other things designed for drumming up interest on this and other subs.",34
1001q6c,FanFiction,9,Three be active in your fandom by reviewing and interacting with others fics. Don't shill your own fic that's just irritating but the fact you interacted will often lead to folks clicking your user name to see what you have written and some of them will probably be interested.,49
1001q6c,FanFiction,10,"Best way is to interact with other people in your fandom, and to share your stories in spaces that are yours, or where advertising is allowed.",26
1001q6c,FanFiction,11,"Post about it on your social media and tag correctly based on the rules for whatever platform you're using. That isn't seen as annoying, because you are allowed to post whatever content to your own blog, as long as you're doing it within reason. If you're reblogging other people's works and commenting on them and just being active in the community, then advertising your stuff will be seen as adding to the community too, rather than shilling. Remember that within your fandom there is going to be a market for your stuff. You just have to put your stuff out there naturally and let *them* find it, rather than shoving it under everyone's noses.",114
1001q6c,FanFiction,12,"Do you cross-post to AO3, and any fandom-specific archives (assuming there are any)? Cross-posting can get more eyes on your page.",21
1001q6c,FanFiction,13,"Promote in the places where it's appropriate. On this subreddit, that would be Friday's Weekly Fic Showcase. Some threads let you post excerpts (""Show me your funniest scene,"" ""What's your most romantic line?"" etc.) A snippet of your writing may get someone interested. If you put your FFN and/or AO3 username in your flair, an intrigued reader can go look up your work directly.",64
1001q6c,FanFiction,14,"Other fanfiction subreddits like r/AO3 also have designated self-promo threads, although that sub is probably for AO3 users. (Another reason to cross-post.)",22
1001q6c,FanFiction,15,"With the caveats that a) it's hard to tell where your readers are coming from and b) you'll never fully know whether your promotion of your fic = more readers, as others have said: post links to the fic in the appropriate places of fannish spaces in your fandom, wherever they are. Be matter-of-fact about it and don't beg. I usually do something like, ""Hey, I posted a new fic, here's the link, go read!"" and then leave it and let it go.",83
1001q6c,FanFiction,16,"The thing about AO3 is that I really just don't like it. Nothing against those who post there, I just prefer FFN.",22
1001q6c,FanFiction,17,But yeah I'll post on threads like that and I'll promote on the weekly showcase. Thanks for the advice.,19
1001q6c,FanFiction,18,"What makes this difficult is that my story is a crossover, so it can be hard to market it to people since many of them are only interested in one fandom or the other. That, along with the crossovers being separated from the main stories means that my fix is essentially hidden from readers who don't go out of their way to look for that specific crossover category. It's frustrating.",70
1001q6c,FanFiction,19,"I write crossovers. I agree it’s twice as difficult than if you stick to a single fandom, but only in the sense you have to do twice the work. People read crossovers, especially this time of year when holiday challenges often incorporate them. Don’t let your perceived lack of audience stop you from promoting your fic. Someone will read it, trust me. It may not be two minutes from now, but speaking as someone who has been posting fanfic since 1998: someone will.",83

1002372,dating_advice,23,So that probably meant she's materialistic. You dodged a bullet,10
1002372,dating_advice,24,Oh you dodged a bullet. She should have just been happy that you remembered to wish her a happy birthday. We're y'all even exclusive when her birthday rolled around or just still in the getting to knew each other phase?,40
1002372,dating_advice,25,"Nope, this broad sounds awful. You need to date other women and show what she missed. You need to delete everything you have of this woman and never talk to her again. She missed her chance.",36
1002372,dating_advice,26,"I know you're bad at dating since you stated it. But you need to date more and more and you will learn how to get women to respect you. For one thing, how in the hell would this awful woman expect a gift from you when you're not even dating her. Don't ever buy women any gifts unless you're in a relationship. If it was me, I wouldn't have even said happy birthday to her. If she mentioned it later, I would have just said happy belated birthday and left it at that making her wonder if I cared at all for her.",103
1002372,dating_advice,27,Let me tell you my experience as a girl..my relationship was just a month old when my long distance boyfriend’s birthday came up and I sent him a surprise gift a branded shirt..unfortunately it wasn’t the right fit but after a few months I bought him another which was more expensive…I just wanted it to be special and moreover its our first year in relationship. Then my birthday came up he didn’t give me anything. I mean I felt bad…like really bad. I mean the fact that he didn’t make the smallest effort did upset me. It doesn’t mean I’m a materialistic person. It’s just the way to show someone that you mean a lot to them…I always treat people the way I want to be treated…,127
1002372,dating_advice,28,Just to mention I’m a student and saved my pocket money to buy him something. He has a nice job and salary.,22
1002372,dating_advice,29,Anyways I didn’t leave my boyfriend but I will never ever gift him anything in future that’s for sure …,20
1002372,dating_advice,30,"She clearly didn't like you that much don't relay on presents, you did it right now you see what kinda person she is",23
1002372,dating_advice,31,I'm convinced some of these posts are a joke.,9
1002372,dating_advice,32,"If a chick starts spouting astronomy bullshit, run. That's likely not the completley irrational thing about her.",17
1002372,dating_advice,33,"It sounds like you guys might be a bit young and the connection wasn’t strong enough to continue on. I doubt her feelings completely shut down because of the gift thing, but maybe it was a small factor, like a straw that broke the camels back sort of thing. Who knows what she’s looking for in a partner. You’ll experience this at least a few times through your life. It’s best to mourn the loss but not dwell too much and move on when you’re ready. You’ll find someone else.",90
1002372,dating_advice,34,"I can see how it might have been hurtful from her perspective, as us girls analyze EVERYTHING, but that does not mean she should expect a gift. And she knows you’re not experienced—if I was in her position, I would be honored that someone trusts me enough to be their first SO. Also, if she just moved on to another guy, there’s a good chance she is lacking self-confidence and believes having a BF means she is “good enough” for someone else. I’m sorry that happened :((",87
1002372,dating_advice,35,Truly though. OP dodged a bullet on this one,9
1002372,dating_advice,36,"Indeed; OP could have been classy and bought a little inexpensive and cute token, with a nice card with something silly / funny written, like ""Happy birthday and 10E6 returns"" (if you are in some kind of science). Girls love these little things. Nobody, however, would buy an expensive gift after so little time and commitment ... if she's really so venal, OP would be better without her.",68
1002372,dating_advice,37,She went cold right after the incident that's why I'm guessing she's upset.,13
1002372,dating_advice,38,So true. The astrology shit alone is a big red flag lol,12
1002372,dating_advice,39,I don't know why it hurts tho I guess it's my first time dealing with these emotions,17

1002372,dating_advice,43,Yeah she probably just wanted an expensive present,8
1002372,dating_advice,44,"Too many red flags. Brush yourself off, and ask more women out",12
1002372,dating_advice,45,Just date a ton of other girls in your school. You have to look at it in a mature way like the rest of us do. That's the whole point of dating is to find who you connect with. She'll start noticing you with other girls anyways not that that's the goal but she will probably regret. In the beginning the power of the relationship goes to who cares less. Whoever is more chill and layed back wins.,78
1002372,dating_advice,46,"It hurts because you’re in your head wondering what’s not good enough about you, what you didn’t to do right. Instead get a little realistic and think about her flaws. Was she really that great or was she just a cute girl that showed some interest in you.",48

1002382,ChineseLanguage,0,Im self teaching myself to learn chinese. Ive learned pinyin so far. Im not sure where to go from there? Grammar? Radicals? Words? Something else? A list of the order would be appreciated.,33
1002382,ChineseLanguage,1,nan,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,2,There might be links to textbooks in the sidebar. Actually you could work on characters and grammar along both lines.,20
1002382,ChineseLanguage,3,ok so you've learnt Pinyin. First of all congratulations! I'm slightly ahead of you. I apparently know 650 words and 479 characters but i still feel like I barely know anything but I have a solid routine in place. Now we can go a bit deeper:,46
1002382,ChineseLanguage,4,**Listening**,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,5,"Imo this is the core skill, especially with Chinese and it's very different sounds. The problem is that listening is very frustrating at this level. Luckily there's a good podcast in ChinesePod. They have 3 podcasts on Spotify. Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. Within each podcast the levels are split even further. [See here for more details](https://support.chinesepod.com/hc/en-us/articles/203689510-Lesson-Levels-Explained). Basically, go to the beginner podcast and start with the Newbie podcasts. Slowly work your way up the levels once you're comfortable with that level. Note, they cover grammar and vocab in these lessons but obviously no Characters.",94
1002382,ChineseLanguage,6,I recommend doing 1/2 per day. Or more if you have tons of time.,14
1002382,ChineseLanguage,7,**Characters**,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,8,"Reading is a pain in the ass because of the writing system. And if you want to do any serious reading you need to learn the characters. My recommendation is to download an SRS/Flashcard (Spaced Repetition System) App to slowly learn Hanzi. There's Anki, Pleco and Skritter. I personally use Skritter and have found great use from it. Note that to get the most out of it, you will need to pay. There are courses within it that teach you basic characters,radicals, etc and also lists from different books, textbooks and HSK Levels. If you go down this route, I recommend going through the courses in the following order: The Skritter Character Course -> Skritter Chinese 101 -> 100 Common Radicals -> HSK 1.",124
1002382,ChineseLanguage,9,I recommend learning 5 new characters/radicals per day. No more than 15/20 otherwise the reviews become overbearing,17
1002382,ChineseLanguage,10,**Reading**,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,11,"To be honest you can start before this, but I think it becomes a lot more palatable after getting through the HSK 1 skritter deck. There are a ton of HSK 1 graded readers. They are boring but with 150 words there's only so much you can do. It will allow you to combine your character knowledge with reading actual texts and really solidify your knowledge. Past this I recommend the Mandarin Companion Series, Chinese Breeze Series and Rainbow Bridge Series. You can get these as physical copies, ebooks or on the app Pleco. There's also the app DU Chinese. Du Chinese has a ton of content which you have to pay for. There's a still some free content to get through so you can hold off paying until you exhaust the free content.",134
1002382,ChineseLanguage,12,**More Structured Content/ Textbooks**,4
1002382,ChineseLanguage,13,"The above is all very unstructured learning. If you want more structure then a textbook like Integrate Chinese (IC) or New Practical Chinese Reader (NPCR) may be for you (although i still recommend doing some separate listening, reading and character learning). I personally use NPCR but I don't think you can go wrong with either. Also worth knowing that the word lists for both text books can be found in Skritter. So you can add them on Skritter before or during when you go through them.",86
1002382,ChineseLanguage,14,&#x200B;,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,15,**Summary**,1
1002382,ChineseLanguage,16,In summary my routine looks like the following:,8
1002382,ChineseLanguage,17,* **Minimum - This is the minimum I force myself to do:**,12
1002382,ChineseLanguage,18,* Review all due cards for the day in Skritter,10
1002382,ChineseLanguage,19,* Go through a bit of NPCR and add all new learnt words to Skritter (20 tops! but usually around 5),21
1002382,ChineseLanguage,20,* If I have time to myself while driving/walking I will listen to a few episodes of ChinesePod,18
1002382,ChineseLanguage,21,"* If I have time to myself and I'm sitting around, I will read some graded readers and maybe add some new words to Skritter from here",27
1002382,ChineseLanguage,22,"Mobile apps are a convenient way to at least start out with a directed experience. My personal preference is SuperChinese, HelloChinese is similar. There are a number of other apps people sometimes recommend. Most of them should have at least some free content. I know both SuperChinese and HelloChinese have a pretty generous amount so you can evaluate them and see how you feel.",64
1002382,ChineseLanguage,23,"Who are you learning with? This is so crucial, because the environment you learn the language in will largely imprint on you as the “personality” of the language. Please find people you really like and are excited to learn with.",40
1002382,ChineseLanguage,24,Characters to supplement your Pinyin and grammar to teach you the structure. At the same time.,16
1002382,ChineseLanguage,25,"You don’t have to learn one after the other. Why not learn everything at the same time? Words, characters, radicals, grammar. Basically I would say focus on whichever one you are most interested in and switch when you get bored. Like for example, learning just radicals is boring. Constantly seeing them and recognizing them helps them stick",57
1002382,ChineseLanguage,26,I'm Chinese. We can communicate and learn. I'm learning English.,10

10027zm,weed,8,I struggle with this.... find a nutrition shake or something decent you can make yourself eat/ drink when you wake up.... for me this causes my metabolism to start and often my stomach will growl in about 2 hours. Without that I'll go days sometimes without food. I have adhd among other things that affect it as well though.... also chronic pain from a spinal injury so weight change for me can worsen the chronic pain.... just the best thing I've found to make yourself hungry is getting the metabolism going in the morning.,94
10027zm,weed,9,Good luck.,2

10029wu,offmychest,1,"I turned 21 a few weeks ago, and since then, everyone has been treating me like I'm an alcoholic.",19

10029wu,offmychest,3,"Every time I watch my younger siblings while my parents are away, I'm told that there are to be no drinks in the house.",24
10029wu,offmychest,4,"After arranging a New Year Party (as my family is leaving my brother alone for New Year and I feel bad for him) with me, my friend, her husband and my siblings, I have my mother messaging me, begging for me not to get drunk and my father telling me that if he finds more than one bottle of champagne in the house, I'll be in trouble.",67
10029wu,offmychest,5,"I would understand their reaction if I had gone crazy during my birthday, proving that I couldn't handle myself. But I had three beers and four shots spread out over the course of six hours.",35
10029wu,offmychest,6,I haven't drunk anything alcoholic beyond that.,7
10029wu,offmychest,7,"This is a frustrating trend I've noticed in my family. I'm never given trust. I'm meant to *earn* trust- trust that I haven't earned after 21 years of being the ideal child (straight a's and b's in school, never dating in school, going to a decent college, never drinking below 21, never even being out past curfew...)",57

10029wu,offmychest,10,I'd so much rather they just tell me how to earn that trust that they allot to everyone else than treat me like I'm a timebomb waiting to go off- like they had for my entire life.,37
10029wu,offmychest,11,"Ahhh champagne, every classic raging alcoholics choice! 🥂🍾🥂",8
10029wu,offmychest,12,Are you and American? Americans have a notorious reputation in the UK for your drinking. Specifically how absolutely terrible you are at it. My first year at university we had a number of American exchange students over and it was embarrassing to go to the pub with any of them apart from the one lass from Boston.,57

10029wu,offmychest,19,"A lot of the frustration comes from the fact that I've done the best I can to earn their trust, and yet when I ask for it, I'm denied it. It's made even more frustrating by the fact that my siblings are given that trust when I'm not.",48
10029wu,offmychest,20,Like a normal week tbh :/,6
10029wu,offmychest,21,Your family is going about it the wrong way but it comes from a place of love. They’ve seen the terrible damage that alcoholism has done to their family members and want to protect you from that. They’re coming from a place of trauma and it us understandable that they may be overly sensitive to alcohol use.,57
10029wu,offmychest,22,Ideally they would have an open and honest discussion with you about their fears and experiences while respecting your choices as an adult.,23
10029wu,offmychest,23,But given their trauma I’d try to just let it be and not resent them for it.,17
10029wu,offmychest,24,What other trust are you not given aside from alcohol?,10
10029wu,offmychest,25,Just fr a few:,4
10029wu,offmychest,26,I wasn't trusted to have my door closed to my room until I was 10.,15

1002krj,Sjogrens,0,Anyone else experience changes in body odor on hydroxychloroquine?,9
1002krj,Sjogrens,1,I’ve been on hydroxychloroquine for about 6 weeks and have noticed a worse and different BO than I’ve ever experienced. In both my armpits and genitalia pits. And I still smell like used trainers right out of the shower.,39
1002krj,Sjogrens,2,So interesting. I've been on Plaquinel for a year but only in the last couple months I've been telling my husband I really stink way more than I ever did. Like if I was just working from home and not working out I could usually skip a full shower now and then but now I better shower every single day and I'm kinda funky by the days end.,68
1002krj,Sjogrens,3,I assumed it was menopause creeping in but maybe it's plaquinel?,11
1002krj,Sjogrens,4,"I'm sorry you're going through that. I haven't had that, but if it keeps up Lume is a good deodorant and you can get it in a stick or a tube so you can use it near (not on) genitals. I can get away with using no deo during the winter but when summer humidity hits, my body would reject even prescription-strength of other brands, but Lume works! I hope this passes quickly for you!",75
1002krj,Sjogrens,5,It's pricey but worth it. Fingers crossed this is a temporary thing that will go away soon!,17
1002krj,Sjogrens,6,OMG I'm not crazy! YES! I had a break off it and then started back on it and COULD NOT figure out where this smell was coming from! Husband could never smell it. I was convinced I was going nuts.,40
1002krj,Sjogrens,7,I stopped cold turkey 3 months ago. No difference whatsoever excep I have no more muscle leg pain since I stopped. I read plaquenil does nothing for Sjogren ( expect joint pain which I don’t have),36
1002krj,Sjogrens,8,"I've been on Plaquenil for over a decade now. I have very dry skin so in the winter I shower every other day only, and I still never noticed any bad smell. I also ask my partner regularly because I'm self-conscious about body odours and he honestly tells me I smell good or ""nothing"". For reference I'm in my thirties (I noticed you commented about menopause).",66
1002krj,Sjogrens,9,"I'd say a bit yes, but before I started it I was also dealing with a LOT of sensitivity in my armpits that made using any products impossible. It was really frustrating and stressful and for awhile I couldn't put anything on my armpits at all without them getting irritated immediately, I could only gently wash them with water and use my hands to apply a gentle soap.",68
1002krj,Sjogrens,10,After leaving them alone for what felt like forever I started using Lume for awhile and that worked really well for me. Now I've been on Plaquenil and I do feel like I smell more and I've tried to experiment again with other deodorants and antiperspirants but the only ones that are non irritating are Lume products. It's a bit expensive compared to what I could buy in stores but it's been the only solution I've found that helps at all.,81
1002krj,Sjogrens,11,"Interesting. I have thought that I may be peri-menopausal, but with all my new diagnoses that has fallen to the side for now. I’ll bring my stink up to my doctor and see what she has to say.",38
1002krj,Sjogrens,12,"Ty for your reply. I have heard of Lume, I probably will give it a try!",16
1002krj,Sjogrens,13,Ty for replying!,3
1002krj,Sjogrens,14,"It works for me. But I also have RA. I need both for saliva production… And diet, of course.",19
1002krj,Sjogrens,15,Ty for replying. I’ve been dx’d with SLE and Sjögren’s recently so am just now starting any treatments.,18
1002krj,Sjogrens,16,Ty for replying!,3
1002krj,Sjogrens,17,Ty for replying! Someone else has recommended Lume so that sounds like a good option to me. I also have sensitive skin so it’s positive to hear that it works well for your sensitivities.,34

But mostly confused on all the paperwork needed and what the EXACT steps are. I’d most likely be buying from a private seller. What documents should I be asking to see? How would I register the car is that before or after you buy it and how? When do I look for insurance, before or after buying? What about getting it safetied? I just feel lost and I’ve tried googling it but it’s just vague answers and I just want a detailed simple to understand explanation in the correct order of what I’m supposed to do. I live in Ontario for reference.",127
1002yfo,Adulting,2,(Note: I'm American),3
1002yfo,Adulting,3,"The easiest way to buy a car is with cash through a dealership. They handle all the paperwork, and their used vehicles are certified (you're not gonna get a shit car--which is a gamble if you go through a private seller).",41

1002yfo,Adulting,5,"The very first thing is to get referrals for an honest mechanic (they do exist!). Insist upon a purchase check. If someone doesn’t want their vehicle checked out by a professional it’s a huge red flag. Also get referrals for an independent insurance agent. They will shop the carriers for you to locate the best deal. You can get coverage online pretty quickly these days, don’t drive the car for a block without it. It’s easy to switch policies then once your agent finds the best deal. We always buy from dealerships and take them to our guy for a purchase check.",102

1003lor,relationship_advice,1,"My boyfriend and I of 3 years broke up at the beginning of November. Was kind of dragged on because we lived together for two weeks while going to a couple's therapist to see if we could make things work, but he ultimately didn't want to, while I was still wanting to work on things. After moving back in with my parents for the time being, I moved the rest of my stuff out of his house at the beginning of this month. I found out he was already on Hinge, and had on his Hinge that he was looking for a long-term relationship, before all of my stuff was even out of his house.",115
1003lor,relationship_advice,2,"On a mutual friend's Instagram story from last night, I saw that a group of his friends all went out. My ex's ex girlfriend from college was there, who he didn't speak with during our relationship to my knowledge, other than when she texted him ""happy holidays"" during the holidays. They dated briefly again at the end of 2018, which was about 7 months before he and I got together. He told me that they wanted different things and just didn't work out as romantic partners. He was hung up on her throughout his entire young adult life and couldn't forget about her, until he dated her again. Just the fact that he went out with her and that she's hanging around friends that I thought were my friends is bad enough, but in one specific video where they were singing at the concert they went to, their faces were *really* close. Almost like they were about to kiss, or were brushing noses or something.",165
1003lor,relationship_advice,3,"I am wildly hurt. I already feel like I'm being left out of a group that I hung out with for three years, but now that he's hanging out with her, I feel like I'm being replaced. Throughout our entire relationship he always told me that he'd never had a connection as strong with anyone as he had with me, and I thought he really loved me. He seemed genuine, and I believed him. I really loved him too. Now, it feels like he's just scrambling to replace me. I had a panic attack when I saw the video, and now I just have intense anxiety that won't go away. He's having an NYE party tonight, one that I obviously wasn't invited to, but I'm heartbroken because I know that his ex will probably be there, and we used to throw an NYE party together every year when we lived together.",151
1003lor,relationship_advice,4,"It should also be said that he never deleted pictures of him with his ex, but he deleted pictures of us from his Instagram. Even after we had an argument about the pictures still being up while we were dating, and he told me ""She was a big part of my life for a while. I'm not just going to delete the pictures."" But then he took pictures of us off of his Instagram. On his Facebook they're still up, just not his instagram.",84
1003lor,relationship_advice,5,"I'm just needing insight and advice. I'm not sure how to handle this information or process it. I struggle with anxiety, and this is just too much to handle right now.

1004n19,GriefSupport,26,"I did my laundry on Christmas and plan to do more today, kind of helps take away the 'special day' and makes it more like any other day. Which honestly, it is. Just trying to hold onto that idea helps a bit.",42

1004n19,GriefSupport,28,"I lost my brother to suicide in July of this year. He was only 30, and although taller than me, my little brother. My grief is overwhelming. I was only 15 months older than him...we used to be so close then drifted apart. My heart is beyond broken. It has caused me to set relationships ablaze in my pursuit for happiness. Therapy is only a bit helpful. I understand what they are saying but my feelings, my grief, they just have me on autopilot. So, tonight I drink, and I'll likely text my brother another emotional and heavy hearted text...that will never be read...but Happy New Year everyone. May our loss just be a reminder of the love we had and still have. 💙",124

1004n19,GriefSupport,33,We celebrated basically like we always did. Minus my father who passed in November. My father wanted us to continue. He didn't want us to be sad. Obviously this is easier said than done. But we kept the tradition and celebrated.,41

1004n19,GriefSupport,46,I’ll be doing the same with occasional visits upstairs and cleaning.,11

I even sometimes dream about ordinary things. People call me ""Ma'am"" whenever, even with no makeup on. I'm not a beautiful woman, but I don't care, that's not why I was there in the first place.

I'm not saying this to be mean, but the 5 years we've been together, she gets ""heartbroken"" over anything that has negative context on her life.

I can promise you this will affect them more and more as they get older. It feels like you’re constantly in a no-win situation and it puts the kids (and you) in the position of trying to keep your wife on an even keel. That’s not their responsibility and it’s not something they will ever be successful at. That constant push and pull of being damned if they do and damned if they don’t will shape them in all the wrong ways and teach them to put up with things they shouldn’t in their relationships.

And how can she be a great mother if your children are watching her constantly freak out all the time? Children feel responsible for their parents’ behavior and if they see her crying and unable to be consoled, they will think they have done something to make her behave that way. Convince her to get help and tell her how she is damaging your kids. Instead of trying to fix her, make sure your children are supported and feel secure. Your job as a father is more important than your job as a husband.",121

1005sp9,relationship_advice,50,"My advice is to wait for a quiet and calm time and then sit down with your wife and SERIOUSLY tell her that you aren't willing to be her punching bag anymore and that she needs to seek help by therapy. If she starts to lose it, repeat that you are no longer going to participate in her unreasonable and overboard responses and will wait until she get herself under control. Then get up and walk away.",77
1005sp9,relationship_advice,51,"Honestly, OP, this is not something you can fix. All you can do is to start protecting yourself from her behavior. She has to fix this. Or not. And then you will have to decide if this is how you want to spend your life.",45

1005sp9,relationship_advice,53,"Clinical depression sufferers who never developed effective coping skills often exhibit behaviors like you wife's. She needs an evaluation by a GP then a Psychiatrist, possibly medication to get her up to a point where she can learn and implement coping skills and long term behavioral counseling by a Psychologist or an experienced Licensed Clinical Social Worker to learn to recognize when she is going down the wrong path and apply effective coping skills. This stuff is a SKILL just like how to repair a house, change a baby or negotiate for a new car. It can be learned.",99
1005sp9,relationship_advice,54,"Her symptoms sound very much like mine when I was younger. Once I saw a doctor, I started antidepressants, discovered I had extremely low Vitamin D levels in my blood, got a referral to a sleep clinic and was diagnosed with sleep apnea from being overweight from eating for comfort and figured out I had Seasonal Affective Disorder (ironically called SAD) by examining my patterns of depression (I always got REALLY depressed in the winter). I learned how to recognize poor thought patterns and behaviors, how to change those behaviors and my life improved greatly over the next few years. Now I don't want to kill myself every day, I've learned when and how to assert myself, my career has taken off and I have developed good long term friendships and relationships. She needs help to get there and you need help to learn how to support her effectively.",149
1005sp9,relationship_advice,55,"Don't waste a day. Talk to her. Get her friends and family to encourage her to take action. It may be the hardest thing she ever does (it was for me) but its worth it in the end. If she doesn't understand or believe its the right thing to do, have an intervention (learn how by googling ""How to have an intervention"") and talk to to her about your concerns. Tell her you are worried about her. Tell her the situation isn't sustainable and is deeply effecting your relationship. Listen to her then ask her to trust you and get help. Once she is comfortable enough with the idea (this may take time), then both of you talk to a General Practitioner to get a referral to a Psychiatrist and to evaluate her physical condition.",135
1005sp9,relationship_advice,56,"There are all kinds of medical issues like thyroid, hormonal and adrenal problems, anemia, vitamin imbalances and other conditions that can be linked to depression but doctors have to run tests to identify or eliminate them. After those causes have been confirmed and treated or eliminated, the Psychiatrist can step in to help her with meds and find a qualified behavioral therapist but start the process right away. This is no different than if she felt a lump on her breast or had extreme knee pain that kept her from walking. Problems have solutions but only if you face them and seek help. Facing things may not be her strength right now but if she trusts you she can still get help.",122
1005sp9,relationship_advice,57,"Illnesses have to be treated to have improvement and there is no shame in treating any illness. My illnesses bundled together almost killed me but now I'm so glad I took action. I learned that some were genetic/medical (neurotransmitter regulation problems and vitamin deficiency), some were weight & sleep related and others required I just learn better ways of dealing with my problems.

1005sp9,relationship_advice,72,Just bear in mind that you cannot make someone help themselves or even acknowledge that they have a problem.,19
1005sp9,relationship_advice,73,"What you can do is understand that this can be a pattern or habit that she has and is unaware of. It isn't personal as you are the safe person, as you said you are the emotional baggage handler.",39
1005sp9,relationship_advice,74,"Part of the issue can be that as the Karpman Drama Triangle explains that she shifts roles for you, sometimes you are the persecutor and other times the rescuer. And sometimes people just want someone to listen and do nothing which I feel is just as hard a role.",49
1005sp9,relationship_advice,75,Research the Victim Mentality and Drama Triangle and you will be able to see what is happening objectively and that might help you through this.,25
1005sp9,relationship_advice,76,"She sounds exhausting. And she should look at getting therapy, a constant need for unnecessary drama and distress in your life isn't normal.",23
1005sp9,relationship_advice,77,You tell her no.,4
1005sp9,relationship_advice,78,"Next time she wants to vent, you tell her no. That she is a grown woman, an adult. She needs to deal with her own inflated sense of being a victim, without dragging you into it.",36
1005sp9,relationship_advice,79,"Tell her that you help her find a therapist, but until she stops being so melodramatic, you will no longer be her emotional punching bag.",25
1005sp9,relationship_advice,80,"Tell her that her actions and behaviour have damaged your relationship with her, and while you don’t want to leave, if she continues on it will be the only option left for you.",33
1005sp9,relationship_advice,81,How did you marry a child?,6
1005sp9,relationship_advice,82,I don’t know how some women can go through life without developing adult skills.,14
1005sp9,relationship_advice,83,Ask her to seek a therapy. And become unavailable when she vents. You are not her punching bag!,18
1005sp9,relationship_advice,84,[It's not about the nail](https://youtu.be/-4EDhdAHrOg).,5
1005sp9,relationship_advice,85,"Women want you to listen, not problem-solve.",7
1005sp9,relationship_advice,86,"Maybe it would help you both if you asked ""Am I listening or am I helping for this one?""",19
1005sp9,relationship_advice,87,I'm not kidding.,3
1005sp9,relationship_advice,88,Before she vents maybe ask her if she wants you to just listen and be supportive or problem-solve it. Sometimes I just want hubby to be supportive and listen.,29
1005sp9,relationship_advice,89,Just listen to her,4
1005sp9,relationship_advice,90,Counselling and couples therapy might help.,6
1005sp9,relationship_advice,91,I just wanted to pick up on this point,9
1005sp9,relationship_advice,92,">I try to console her and I'll say things like ""**you shouldn't let people walk all over you**"". Then she gets mad at me because now I'm ""lecturing"" her. She further breaks down telling me how sh!ty she feels and I make it worse by telling her she ""needs to do better""... Which is what she got out of my comment.",61
1005sp9,relationship_advice,93,"Saying ""don't let people walk all over you"" isn't consoling here. You are lecturing her at this point and it seems she wants comfort, not solutions here.",27
1005sp9,relationship_advice,94,I would suggest that you have a clear conversation with her when she is calm and explain that you're not going to intervene with any situation unless she directly asks you to.,32
1005sp9,relationship_advice,95,"She needs to fix her problems. Everytime she tells you about them to “vent,” she is dumping it on you and is being rewarded for not fixing it, unfortunately.",29
1005sp9,relationship_advice,96,"As a SO I would reasonable support, but cut her off once it’s too much for you.",17
1005sp9,relationship_advice,97,"Unfortunately, hate to say it, you would be enabling her further if you keep empathizing with her -> she never fixes her issues by herself.",25
1005sp9,relationship_advice,98,"I’m not sure how to fix this, I would probably listen to 4-5 sentences, then change activity/subject. Gradually lessen how much you listen. Ask her questions and leave the answers hanging. Do not propose solutions and do not step in. It’s going to be a process, if you want to do this.",52
1005sp9,relationship_advice,99,My wife has a similar though not quite as bad behaviour. She interprets everything as a personal attack. She's been in a bunch of therapy and gotten prescribed medicines lots of times that she doesnt want to take. Thing continue to go poorly.,43
1005sp9,relationship_advice,100,This is not something that fixes itself. It's likely a medical or personality disorder that needs treatment. Please see if you can have her seek out therapy so she'll have a chance to feel better.,35
1005sp9,relationship_advice,101,If that doesnt work give some thought to if this is how you want to live the rest of your life.,21
1005sp9,relationship_advice,102,"If she doesn't choose consciously to go to therapy and make the most out of it, you two are getting a divorce at some point.",25
1005sp9,relationship_advice,103,"I have no clue how you can convince her, though maybe you should attend therapy yourself and recommend she joins you. But yeah, a person in poor mental health who refuses to deal with problems like an adult is not someone you'll be able to stay happy with. Don't let her run your life like you're caring for a toddler, she needs to commit to working on her problems healthily.",70
1005sp9,relationship_advice,104,"This is a complex woman. So are her feelings, and she is immature and probably spoiled. Some of that is good, but her behavior is like living with a time bomb....",31
1005sp9,relationship_advice,105,"Therapy, that's what it is for.",6
1005sp9,relationship_advice,106,"Your wife is an emotional black hole. She needs therapy or something, I would not be able to deal with this for long.",23
1005sp9,relationship_advice,107,If she's such hard work I've got to wonder why you married her.,13
1005sp9,relationship_advice,108,Is your wife bipolar? Because I know someone like that who's bipolar when she doesn't take her meds.,18
1005sp9,relationship_advice,109,Sounds like your wife is pretty abusive,7
1005sp9,relationship_advice,110,This lady sounds like someone I used to work with. Played the victim always “cried” over everything. Yuck I hated her,21
1005sp9,relationship_advice,111,It sounds exhausting,3
1005sp9,relationship_advice,112,Ah Prince Harry. I feel your pain.,7
1005sp9,relationship_advice,113,She needs DBT therapy if she’s borderline. It can be incredibly effective,12
1005sp9,relationship_advice,114,This opens another can of worms 😨,7
1005sp9,relationship_advice,115,"that would drive me crazy. I couldn't do it. I love politics, but when one of my friends starts in about some political thing that I have already heard, I want to shut it down. And politics are one of my favorite subjects, but I need original thought.",48
1005sp9,relationship_advice,116,Can I vent to you some more?,7
1005sp9,relationship_advice,117,This is the most direct and concise answer so far.,10
1005sp9,relationship_advice,118,There's asking someone to listen and there's asking someone to constantly take on their emotional baggage without remotely trying to be proactive about their own mental health.,27
1005sp9,relationship_advice,119,"I've tried asking, she ""doesn't know"". She's not one to make decisions especially when in an altered state of mind",20
1005sp9,relationship_advice,120,"I always want problem solving. But then again, I always want to problem solve as well.",16
1005sp9,relationship_advice,121,And frankly all my female friends are the same. I guess we are anomalies.,14
1005sp9,relationship_advice,122,I won't bring up a problem unless I want someone else's perspective.,12
1005sp9,relationship_advice,123,I literally just posted a similar comment 😂,8
1005sp9,relationship_advice,124,"But how many hours a week does OP have to listen? For example is it okay for OP to say they will listen for say, one hour one time per week?",31
1005sp9,relationship_advice,125,"She’s histrionic. What she wants is to be the victim, and having to take responsibility for her behavior interferes with that.",21
1005sp9,relationship_advice,126,"I agree he shouldn’t say that, but for the reason that he is doing these third parties a disfavor since the circumstances are never as dire as she represents.",29
1005sp9,relationship_advice,127,She absolutely needs counseling. This is not normal behavior and is harming her and her relationships.,16
1005sp9,relationship_advice,128,"I second DBT. Maybe she would benefit from an intensive outpatient program, if you have one nearby.",17
1005sp9,relationship_advice,129,"This is exactly it. She's a drama queen, and a bit of an emotional vampire.",15
1005sp9,relationship_advice,130,"So when she starts talking about something bad happening to her, ask her if she wants anything from you. She will likely say no. Then take EVERYTHING she says about the situation and divide it by 2? or 3 or 10? You know your wife, so you know the denominator.",50
1005sp9,relationship_advice,131,"If her drama is boring you, tell her that you are starting to be drained by all of this, so perhaps she can limit her outbursts/emotional dumping to once a week, and she can tell you all the times she's been a victim for that week.",46
1005sp9,relationship_advice,132,This...,1
1005sp9,relationship_advice,133,It's every other day it seems. It's almost predictable.,9
1005sp9,relationship_advice,134,"She's high functioning and is a chiropractor. She doesn't own her own business, so she's a slave to her schedule. Outpatient services aren't conducive to her schedule and they are strict with attendance.",33
1005sp9,relationship_advice,135,"My friend, I was married to one of these emotional vampires, it’s going to continue to get worse until she gets professional help. At some point YOU will become her target. You will say or do something “wrong” and she will turn on you, telling people you are a horrible husband. Abusive. Lazy. Unsupportive. A cheater. Whatever. Insist she get therapy ASAP before this happens.",65
1005sp9,relationship_advice,136,Honestly… let her call go to voicemail once in a while. She can tell you about it at dinner that night,21
1005sp9,relationship_advice,137,She needs to prioritize her mental health over her career at this point.,13
10069bp,lowgradegliomas,0,I was just diagnosed today with a low grade glioma at about 44mm. I’m only 35. Even with surgery will I even make it to 50 years old?,28

unknown,unknown,1,There’s a chance depending on type grade mutations how much they take out. They generally always come back but people can go 30 years and maybe even longer and even when you figure out the type and stuff they base it on statistics and there are outliers but I would say there’s a good chance you’ll make it to fifty at the same time I am being hopeful low grade is good that’s generally a grade 2 but they won’t truly know until they open you up. I’m 34 I have Oligodendroglioma grade 2 and had my operation back in sept 27th I have an idh1 mutant so all those are in my favor but I do believe it’s possible for it to start growing even a year after treatment as I’ve seen someone else in this subreddit have that happen but odds are I’ll probably make it to fifty or even sixty,153
unknown,unknown,2,Yes - you will.,4
unknown,unknown,3,Keep funding research,3
unknown,unknown,4,Thank you for sharing!,4
unknown,unknown,5,No I literally got diagnosed via MRI this afternoon,9
unknown,unknown,6,Surgery went well but I found out I have a grade 3 astrocytoma so I will need radiation and chemo. Have a little trouble speaking but it’s getting better.,29
unknown,unknown,7,Thank you!,2
unknown,unknown,8,Listen to your doctors. Seek second opinions. You don’t get a diagnosis until you have had surgery to send brain tissue to a pathologist. Then starts the process of understanding your diagnosis and what further steps you’d take to have as normal a life as possible.,46
unknown,unknown,9,"I responded to your question on my post. It’s rollercoaster. I was a basket case for like 2 weeks after I was told I had a LGG, so was my husband. It’s impossible not to Google things when you have a complete void of info. My neurosurgeon said that the studies that are available seem dismal, but technology/treatment has come unbelievably far even in the past 5 years. Future studies are proving much more hopeful. Do you have a neurosurgery referral or appointment yet?",84
unknown,unknown,10,Type of tumour cannot be diagnosed by MRI only. Lab analysis of biopsy sample is needed.,16
unknown,unknown,11,From MRI only they can give a differential diagnosis listing some possibilities.,12

unknown,unknown,30,"A high grade glioma? Only genetic testing can know for sure so have hope, but my doctors are optimistic and the treatment plan is in place just gotta take it one step at a time. There are good days and bad now that Ive processed what’s really going on but again like I said, the doctors seem optimistic, so I’m going to hold onto hope. surgery was rough for the first few days because of the swelling so I really couldn’t speak but after getting home it got a lot better and the pain went away to for the most part.

unknown,unknown,3,"Siiighh. I hate that so much. I almost died when I was 15 because every doctor I saw thought I was either depressed, anxious, or had an eating disorder. It’s honestly so harmful when you really need answers.",38

unknown,unknown,6,Thank you. I got a laugh out of this.,9
unknown,unknown,7,True. There is so many things it could be. But I'm told it's anxiety and depression at the doctor so I figured what harm could an online quiz be. I'm not going to take it seriously. I thought at least an online quiz won't call me depressed. It was a slap in the face I didn't see coming.,58
unknown,unknown,8,In truth I got more help from support groups than doctors. (dont worry I still see the doctor) :),19

1006dn1,CrestedGecko,3,"I freaked out and put him back in his enclosure. I’ve had him since we was very small, and he’s never done this before. I think he was angry or stressed, but he was eating happily just moments before.",39

1006dn1,CrestedGecko,6,It’s a mating call.,4
1006dn1,CrestedGecko,7,It didn’t sound like the videos online though. It sounded more like a squeak that devolved into a hiss.,19
1006dn1,CrestedGecko,8,"Ok, just checking. Squeak then hiss is very displeased indeed.",10
1006dn1,CrestedGecko,9,why would he be mad? He was eating peacefully on my hand moments before.,14
1006dn1,CrestedGecko,10,"Existential angst? I don’t know, but they make noises with purpose. It’s risky for prey animals like cresties to draw attention to themselves, so when they make noises, they are trying to communicate something. They especially don’t hiss for fun.",40
1006dn1,CrestedGecko,11,"maybe something spooked him?? im doing something similar with my juvie (god he loves croaking at everything, i've seen him croak at a cricket then devour it 😭😭😭) but one time i had some mango and i coaxed him out, he started eating, then squeaking so i put him back as to not stress him. i had my fan going and so i turned it off just to see, but the little shit apparently got scared of the fan blade/shadows. i agree with your statement but god they can be temperamental",91
1006dn1,CrestedGecko,12,"Our crestie that we owned till he was 25 used to croak a lot! He was verbal when he was alone, when he was handled or when he was just vibin at night.

1006pzg,depression,2,"Do something fun for yourself. I had something similar last Christmas and cooked my favorite meal, watched my favorite movie and had a great time",25
1006pzg,depression,3,"Anything that you can do to get out of your head is a coping mechanism. If it has negative effects it is considered unhealthy. Listening to music, watching tv or a movie, playing video games, counting, focus objects, etc are all good coping mechanisms as long as they don't interfere with your day to day functioning.",56
1006pzg,depression,4,"Music is a big one for me. I'm basically always listening to music so I can get out of my head. If I'm having a really hard time, I switch to dubstep/industrial/metal.",32
1006pzg,depression,5,"Consider your role in not being invited. Picky, loud, moody, ....? Did you express interest? Do they have ESP? Be honest with yourself....and change that shit up! Be well, friend. Introspect, don't blame and resent.",35
1006pzg,depression,6,Thanks for the help. I done that and just felt empty. As my family have a group chat in fb and they have been sending pics of them all being happy without me,33
1006pzg,depression,7,Thanks for the advice bud 👍. Not going to lie but I've been drinking to numb the pain but I will try listening to music instead 😀,27
1006pzg,depression,8,Fuck that's just mean. I'm sorry you have such a shitty family,12
1006pzg,depression,9,"Alcohol is definitely a powerful anxiolytic/antipsychotic, but it is generally not considered a healthy coping mechanism, even in moderation. I understand the draw though, being 12 years sober myself",29
1006pzg,depression,10,I definitely support listening to music as a coping mechanism. I find it helpful to listen to music that I can relate to in how I'm feeling because it makes me feel validated and understood/less alone. Listening to happy/pop music just makes me feel worse,45
1006wk8,DogAdvice,0,Dog doesn't like the blinker being on...,7
1006wk8,DogAdvice,1,"We have a 5 year old male GSD. We've had him for 2 1/2 years and he absolutely loves going for rides every chance he gets. Within the past couple months he has started whining every time the blinker is on. He has never had this issue before and as soon as the blinker is turned off, he is fine. Just wondering if anyone else has had this issue with their fur babies and what you've done to get them more accustomed to it (besides not using the blinkers 😂)",90
1006wk8,DogAdvice,2,"Do training in your drive way. Turn blinker on, distract w treat, if no whine he gets it. Over and over and over again. Once non reactive to it whilst stationery, get a helper to drive while u repeat training on the move. Over and over and over.",48

z97w6e,Clothing,0,Brands similar to Unfinished Legacy???,5
z97w6e,Clothing,1,Looking for a smaller company similar to UL that sells original pieces of clothing. Preferably of a similar graphic art style as UL. I really love this brand but find myself purchasing a little too much from them.,38

z98394,TravelNursing,0,Anyone have trouble negotiating contracts?,5
z98394,TravelNursing,1,Hey all! I have been traveling for about 1.5 years and have gotten relatively decent contracts but I have come to realize that my agency does not really let me negotiate much and usually tells me to talk to the manager after I sign.,44
z98394,TravelNursing,2,"For example, I am being offered a contract now with the pay range at the absolute lowest of the bracket given. I brought this up and was basically shot down immediately saying the contract listing stated the pay range before I said I was interested and that the quoted offer falls in this range (by $5).",56
z98394,TravelNursing,3,"I asked if I could have a clause that included block scheduling as my plan is to get a long term AirBnB with the option of being able to drive home some days that I am not working, having recently bought a house and having house projects to do (about 7 hours one way). My agency basically said they cannot guarantee that and I would have to talk to the manager, but go ahead and sign because I only have 24 hours.",82
z98394,TravelNursing,4,"I was then further told that I really should not be declining offers based on pay, location, or shift as all of that is laid out upfront. My issue being that the pay is a broad range and the shift just stating like 3x12 but no guarantee if it is one off, one on or what.",56
z98394,TravelNursing,5,"So all that being said, does anyone have any experience with the same or tips regarding this? I actually do not mind the location of this contract offer, it is a smaller hospital so could be an interesting change from my normal. I am just more worried that I want to ask for a block-style schedule and my recruiter is basically saying sign now, ask later, and then what if “later” comes along and the manager says they cannot offer that.",81
z98394,TravelNursing,6,Give yourself an emergency fund so you can afford to be patient and picky.,14
z98394,TravelNursing,7,Find another recruiter and leverage them against each other. Especially bigger agencies will try to lower your rates because they’re usually still higher than smaller agencies.,26
z98394,TravelNursing,8,But go to the second recruiter anyway and be like if they can just match and give me xyz you’d be surprised what you can get out of it.,29
z98394,TravelNursing,9,I feel like its been a lot more difficult to get things added into contracts like block scheduling or patient limits when floated etc. They don't budge on their pay either. Things are changing I guess.,36
z98394,TravelNursing,10,"So, the block scheduling thing, you should discuss that with the manager prior to an offer even being made (unless it's an auto offer). The manager should either agree or disagree. If they agree, then it should be written into the contract, as it's a pre-approved stipulation.",47
z98394,TravelNursing,11,"The only way I've negotiated was by waking away from an offer for a better one. Tried asking nicely, tried showing what other travelers were making, tried to initiate a back and forth with recruiter/hospital but nope.",37
z98394,TravelNursing,12,The negotiation should happen before an offer letter is signed...even before you send them credentialing - that’s when you have the power. If your agency really seems averse to negotiation; I would reconsider if that’s the best relationship for you.. Many nurses have multiple agencies they’re in contact with; could be a great route for you.,56
z98394,TravelNursing,13,"it has been harder...more of a 'take it or leave it' attitude from the agencies it seems. Unfortunately, they want loyalty on the back-side but don't really seem to do anything to earn it. My recruiter from previous gig liked to say stuff like 'I fight for you' and 'always here for you' but was getting crap offers from dumpster fires. She's sorta given me the cold shoulder since I took a better offer from a different agency. However, current agency gives all the 'corporate' responses when ever try to negotiate... even tho the hospital says their rates haven't changed. Extension has a slight bump in hourly but OT rate dropped a good bit. Next contract gonna be up for grabs!",121
z98394,TravelNursing,14,I did have a decent emergency fund built up but recently put a bit into buying a house so slowly building it back up.,24
z98394,TravelNursing,15,"I do think getting a second recruiter could be beneficial though! My last 2 contracts have been in the lower half of the pay range, so having some leverage in regards to that and helping with scheduling could be beneficial!",40
z98394,TravelNursing,16,"I’m just having a harder time with this contract especially since the rate is actually lower than I was making as staff, without accounting for stipend of course.",28
z98394,TravelNursing,17,"Yeah it seems like a lot is changing! I’ve normally been very open about my schedule, usually tell them I’ll do my best to work what they need. I just normally ask if they can to try to block them for me as it helps with arrangements with classes and stuff, but I am flexible in that I will work with them as much as I can. This is the first time I specifically requested to add it into my contract.",81
z98394,TravelNursing,18,"Good to know! So of the contracts I’ve done, I think I have spoken to a manager twice before the offer. Most of the time, I guess they are auto offers (at least in my case)? I definitely didn’t speak with anyone this go around.",45
z98394,TravelNursing,19,"Don’t loot at the rate, look at the whole weekly pay. If that’s enough, take it. I always have an amount in mind that I won’t go under.",28
z98394,TravelNursing,20,"There are not as many contracts out there now, which means you have less room to negotiate.",17
z98394,TravelNursing,21,Hourly rates being lower than staff rates are common. The stipend is where the real money is made,18
z98394,TravelNursing,22,"You can still ask your agency for a contact number to discuss these things prior. Unless the listing specifies that it's an auto offer, you have no way of knowing if you'll talk to someone before signing. So if that's the case, then you're well within rights to turn things down.",51
z98394,TravelNursing,23,Thanks again! I may see if I can get a contact number! I would definitely love to speak with someone about their scheduling before signing.,25

z98xrd,personalfinance,0,"I’m a college student who’s looking into purchasing my first car this summer, any advice?",15
z98xrd,personalfinance,1,Hi y’all.,2
z98xrd,personalfinance,2,"A little background: My first car broke down last year and it was just too expensive for my family to fix, it was kind of a lemon car and my Dad has been in the oil and gas industry for years, and ever since COVID, the industry hasn’t been doing too well and now he’s switched careers. Been a rough time for the family honestly but we’re on our feet. I grew up in a pretty good stable household, my dad pays for my college but I can tell it’s a struggle for him to do so, and I’m 21 years old so I know it’s time for me to pull my own weight and purchase my own. It’s something I really want to do because I hate relying on others. My siblings also are going to need my parents’ help getting a car so I need to buy my own regardless.",152
z98xrd,personalfinance,3,I have 2 lines of credit and a 689 credit score. I opened my first card this last summer with Capital One and my second one just recently with Discover. My total line is only $1000 though ($500 + $500). I’ve never missed a payment and the student loans my dad covered have helped my credit score jump.,58
z98xrd,personalfinance,4,"With that being said, I’d like to finance or purchase a car but the market is just so ridiculous so I might need to finance if I want a reliable vehicle.",31
z98xrd,personalfinance,5,I make ~$1100 a month on my own as a videographer with a guaranteed source of income from employment and I just need some advice and what steps to take so I can purchase a vehicle on my own and not get scammed but also don’t make myself broke.,49
z98xrd,personalfinance,6,I would look for a second hand japanese car like Toyota. Low or mid mileage with 5 to 8!years of use and I would try to get it from a dealer that offers some type of warranty,37
z98xrd,personalfinance,7,>I make ~$1100 a month on my own as a videographer with a guaranteed source of income from employment and I just need some advice and what steps to take so I can purchase a vehicle on my own and not get scammed but also don’t make myself broke.,49
z98xrd,personalfinance,8,"Making that little (and your family encountering potential financial harship), you should buy a cheap beater.",16
z98xrd,personalfinance,9,"That means probably an early 2000s civic, elantra, or corolla (preferably with a mismatched color fender or door so you can get it for cheap)",25
z98xrd,personalfinance,10,Start saving your pennies for an old Honda or Toyota.,10
z98xrd,personalfinance,11,You make 13k a year. You can't afford to finance any car really. Start saving money for a beater,19
z98xrd,personalfinance,12,"You probably considered this already, but if not- any thoughts or possibility of public transportation or an e-bike maybe?",19
z98xrd,personalfinance,13,"- its not only the cost of the car, its the maintenance AND insurance cost as well",17
z98xrd,personalfinance,14,Thanks for the response. I indeed have looked into public transit but I live in Phoenix so the public transit is next to nothing here honestly.,26
z998dc,subaru,0,Remote Starter Kits?,3
z998dc,subaru,1,"Hello everyone, I'm looking to purchase a remote start kit for my girlfriends 2020 STI for the holidays. I'm not too familiar with foreign cars, and I know subies can be kind of picky with modifications so I want to make sure I get her the right one.",48
z998dc,subaru,2,Anybody know the best to use for Subarus? Are they universal with any kit?,14
z998dc,subaru,3,Thanks in advance for your responses! I'll reply to further questions if needed.,13
z998dc,subaru,4,"Although it isn’t recommended to put a remote start on a manual vehicle, compustar has a system you might want to look into.",23
z998dc,subaru,5,\+1 for the compustar system. the way theirs works is actually pretty failsafe for stick cars in general. getting their pro T13 installed on monday myself on my 17 wrx,30
z998dc,subaru,6,Can I ask why manuals aren't recommended for Remote startups? Is it something to do with the clutch not being pressed down?,22
z998dc,subaru,7,Correct! All cars are equipped with a neutral safety switch and all modern manual vehicles have a safety feature which requires the clutch to be pressed in to be started. Also a good rule of thumb for manual vehicles is to put your car into 1st gear with the park brake enabled.,52
z999ap,Bend,0,Car needs to move,4
z999ap,Bend,1,"My mom's car got a notice and I need to move it, but it won't jump and we don't have the money to repair it. Am I allowed to push it up the street or will Bend Police department be dicks about it.",43
z999ap,Bend,2,"Notices about towing are complaint driven. According to the cop who I talked to when ours was given a notice after 12 hours of sitting there. New neighbors apparently call on anyone in front of their house. So if some one does call again, they will probably enforce it. If you park it in the other direction you could argue it was moved but that will only buy you a few days.",72
z999ap,Bend,3,"You're taking a big chance just moving it a few feet. I had a car tagged once and when I called Bend PD saying that I was concerned about driving and then parking it back in the same space, I was told that as long as I had driven it ""a few miles"" they would be able to determine that and I would be fine. How they determine how far it is driven, I don't know.",76
z999ap,Bend,4,"I don't know how you see this as Bend PD being ""dicks"". Folks were fed up with people storing nonoperational cars on the street and the city did something about it by passing the ordinance saying that you can't stay parked in the same place for more than 72 hours.",50
z999ap,Bend,5,"You can also remove the battery and take to Autozone or whatever for a charge, if it will take one. I believe no cost.",24
z999ap,Bend,6,"Also might see if there is a shop that has a tender with repair mode. I own one that has revived a few different “permanently dead” batteries. Not sure if that’s a thing, but also kind of a plug for the NOCO 10. I love that thing.",47
z999ap,Bend,7,Just pull it with another car. Seen people doing that last week down a busy street,16
z999ap,Bend,8,City's Traffic Code does not allow a vehicle to be parked on a city street for longer than **72 hours.**,20
z999ap,Bend,9,If it has no Registration or already cited the tow companies will impound it. Other neighbors will file complaints etc,20
z999ap,Bend,10,I started mine once by pouring Dr. Pepper on the battery connections. Then replacing said connections after driving to the O.O.O...O'Reilly.,21
z999ap,Bend,11,"Edit to add: this is totally true story but actually probably the worst advice on this thread, other than to check / clean / or replace the connections and get down to an auto parts store for some diagnostics of the battery and maybe some repair parts as others have mentioned.",51
z999ap,Bend,12,Check and clean the battery connections. If the car has been sitting and you can’t turn it over with a full battery or a jump start corrosion might be the issue.,31
z999ap,Bend,13,"If that doesn’t work, tap on the starter motor while cranking with a piece of wood or a rubber mallet. Sometimes they get stuck and just need a little jostle to turn over.",33
z999ap,Bend,14,"Sounds like you have a dick/ Karen neighbors that is a cop caller. Yes you can push the car but you also need figure what neighbor is the spineless cop caller that is afraid to talk to their own neighbors, and would rather waste police resources on vehicles parked in front of your house.",54
z999ap,Bend,15,"You'll want to look up the specific city parking code to determine how far it needs to go. I haven't looked at Bend's but most cities will say something like ""cannot be parked on the same block"". Non-operational vehicles usually have their own constraints. Instead of 72 hours you may only be able to park it in one place for 24.",61
z999ap,Bend,16,"Ahh, bringing back memories for my first car. Crawling under the front and whacking the starter hoping it fires up.",20
z999ap,Bend,17,or Rodent damaged wiring and worse,6
z999ap,Bend,18,The beaters I grew up with were powerful motivators to buy a dependable car.,14
z999ap,Bend,19,"That seems beyond OP’s abilities, I just wanted to share some of the easy troubleshooting. You’re right though and it starts once it gets cold. My old man’s ranch truck gets torn up every winter.",35

z99f9l,GoldandBlack,2,"I've looked at the Crash Course history playlists, but they somehow manage to find a way to always add a leftist slant to almost every topic. Things like discussing how much ""more egalitarian"" hunter-gathered societies were, or the typical takes on industrialization.",42

When I was being trained by the leaving teacher I noticed how all the kids seemed to know she was leaving and said goodbye to her on the last day. I just took mental stock of that and said in my head its normal for teachers to tell kids they're leaving before they go. So as my Contract comes to an end i tell my everyday kids im leaving. Some parents called in and asked about it so my boss got annoyed and told me to not say anything anymore and she would tell the rest of the kids when i was leaving. That never happened so the younger kids probably don't know what happened but it did eventually spread around so that most of the older kids new.",176
z99wqq,relationship_advice,2,"Those older kids asker when I was going back to America and I was confused and just told them im not as i planned to be in this country for many years, maybe my whole life. After that they kept asking again and again for my number and I would brush it off. At that time i was brushing it off i also met with a friend native to that country and he mentioned how he was having lunch with his grade school teacher the next day. I was surprised and asked if it was common for people to do that here (since it's not really a thing in america) and he said it's not ""common"" but not ""uncommon"" either. After that I asked a teacher native to this country if it's not allowed to give out my number to students. She said it's uncommon but not ""not allowed' so i just kind of sat on that for a while.",160
z99wqq,relationship_advice,3,"So after my kids kept asking eventually I told them we can make a deal. Ask your parents and If its OK then you can have my number. Some kids came back and said their parents said its OK with a note, some didnt and I didnt want to call them liars so I gave the ones with notes my number as I promised. Today (my contract has ended atleast a week now) my boss called and asked why I did that and I told her the truth of why. She told me it was stressing her out and kept asking why I did it and I just kept repeating why. She then told me not to pick up if any parents call and to never do that again as it causes stress for the teachers left behind. I really didn't imagine it was a big deal because of the responses I got from friend and coworker but now I wonder if I was wrong or if this comes off in a bad way. Maybe the kids did lie in the end to get my number so now I feel bad about what's happened. does anyone have any insight?",199

z99xdc,transgenderUK,0,Private Gender Clinic application,4
z99xdc,transgenderUK,1,Hi so I'm going to sign up to a private gender clinic (I'm thinking Gender Doctors).,16
z99xdc,transgenderUK,2,When filling out the form what are the Do's and Don'ts?,11
z99xdc,transgenderUK,3,"What do I mention, what don't I mention? What is most likely to get me an appointment. Do I mention that my gender dysphoria is distracting me from things I enjoy and need to do, because that's the truth. I'm sure this is me just over thinking (as I normally do) I just fear rejection and wanted to make sure I don't make any mistakes before I submit the form. Anything specific about Gender Doctors/ Dr Kirpal Sahota would be helpful too.",82
z99xdc,transgenderUK,4,"Be honest, but don't stress too much, one of the upsides of private care is they are a business at the end of the day so they will look for reasons to accept you as a patient rather than reasons to turn you away.",44
z99xdc,transgenderUK,5,"Just tell the truth. If the clinic is competent, they will understand and know you’re trans based on your honest experiences. There’s not really a way to make a mistake in it as long as you’re being truthful that’s all they want to see",44
z99xdc,transgenderUK,6,"I was worried before my private appointment after hearing all the horror stories from people who went the NHS route, but the doctor I saw at Gender Care was really nice. There are questions they have to ask to tick boxes but they're not trying to catch you out.",49
z99xdc,transgenderUK,7,When you're paying hundreds of pounds for an hour long consultation there's a lot more incentive for the doctor to actually help you so you're more likely to recommend them to other people.,33
z99xdc,transgenderUK,8,I hope this helps and wish you the best!,9
z99xdc,transgenderUK,9,don't look suicidal...,3
z99xdc,transgenderUK,10,are you going to get a diagnosis via this? I am with LTC so got my diagnosis seperately:,18
z99xdc,transgenderUK,11,"I looked at a combination of the diagnosis i was going for, and the WPATH SOC so i could play up the parts of my life that fitted the diagnosis and things that could be seen as *signs* from earlier on. could be useful for people who didn't necesserilly '*know*' as kids or whatever to find something to talk about",60
z99xdc,transgenderUK,12,"i also made sure to avoid any of the things that the WPATH SOC suggested could prevent transition - principly make sure that my mental health issues looked well managed, or however they put it.",35
z99xdc,transgenderUK,13,"the rest was a couple of general mental health multi-part quizes I think. they are generic, so could be researched and again, just look stable.",25
z99xdc,transgenderUK,14,LTC forms were mostly factual so that was just entered as is. including them having a copy of my records sent from the GP i think...,26
z99xdc,transgenderUK,15,"Yeah Gender Care is my back up, just in case I don't get an appointment with Gender Doctors but I've had a search around reddit and it seems that I will likely get an appointment with them since I've not seen a single post from someone who hasn't (it may take a few tries though). That put me at ease but still very nervous and the wait times for endocrinologist are going to be painful (though less so than waiting for NHS)",82
z99xdc,transgenderUK,16,"Yeah, lucky for me most my mental health has gotten better. Less anxious, less depressed. Nothing really that couldn't be linked to gender dysphoria.",24
z99xdc,transgenderUK,17,"Gender Doctors seems a lot more simpler than LTC I feel. I have seen done more research and think I'll be fine, just over thinking again as I do.",29
z99xdc,transgenderUK,18,"My wiat for the 1st appointment was about a month, but about 10 weeks for the endo. That was after I approached another endo who said they could fit me in around March 2023 🙃",35
z99xdc,transgenderUK,19,Everyone be busy. So many eggs cracked during the pandemic. I realised I was trans 2 years ago apparently... didn't even realise it was that long ago.,27
z99zub,trans,0,Anyone have experience transitioning in quebec montreal?,7
z99zub,trans,1,I want to start transitioning but im not sure where so was wondering if anyone who already has started can help me,22
z99zub,trans,2,"Yes! I began transitioning in June of 2021. You're in luck, because Montreal is probably one of the best places to be trans in the world.",26
z99zub,trans,3,"When I finally came out to myself, I first reached out to a therapist who had experience with trans issues and the Montreal queer community, and she was able to give me some great advice. If you're not seeing a therapist, I do recommend it - it helped me immensely. They can be really good resources.",56
z99zub,trans,4,The below is primarily relevant if you are over 18.,10
z99zub,trans,5,"If you are considering medically transitioning, know that Quebec is an informed consent province, which means that you do not require therapy prior to being prescribed hormones, so long as you are not a minor. Nor do you require an endocrinologist, specifically, to prescribe HRT. You'll go in for a consultation and they'll go over the basics. I do recommend doing research into HRT first, just so you can go in somewhat prepared with any questions/concerns. (Note that, unlike HRT, surgeries, you will typically require letters from therapists.)",88
z99zub,trans,6,"I initially started at Clinique l'Actuel, which is public, but unfortunately, my doctor migrated to a private clinic (Clinique A/Centre DGL Hormonotherapie). You may have to face some wait times, so it's worth reaching out to a few places.",39

I've never had any trouble at any CLSC, hospital, SAAQ outlet, store or anything. I've even taught classes, and nobody raises an eyebrow.",64

unknown,unknown,6,[deleted],1
unknown,unknown,7,"So they aren't going to pry into your financial situation. You'll just meet up with a doctor and go over the process. Explain to them that you're trans and that you want to start HRT. They'll go over the details, and you can ask any questions you have. You might want to look into benefits, risks, timelines, and administration methods beforehand. They'll send you off for some initial blood work, which you can get done at a CLSC (it won't cost you anything). The appointment at the clinic shouldn't' cost anything, or if it does, it'll be a small administrative fee (I think I had to pay $10).",108
unknown,unknown,8,"If you do end up opting for HRT and get a prescription, you will have to pay for the hormones, though fortunately, a chunk of the cost is covered by RAMQ. In my case, I started off with estradiol (estrogen) and spironolactone (anti-androgen). I've since added progesterone, and my pharmacy bill is between $35 and $38 per month for the three drugs.",62
unknown,unknown,9,"I don't know how long the waiting list is for either clinic, so I would advise reaching out to both of them. If you do get an appointment with one of them, you can always let the other clinic know that you no longer need their services, but at least this way you'll be seen the soonest possible.",58

z9aek2,AskDocs,3,"When I got home, i presumed it was a migraine since I had one earlier the week prior and found soaking my feet in hot water helped. I ended up puking into the tub and just laying on the floor crying and continuously vomiting from the pain which made the pain throb in the back of my neck worse. The pain would radiate back and forth between the back of my neck to my front temples, throbbing pain and no relief from tylenol.",83
z9aek2,AskDocs,4,"My partner concerned tried to help me into our bedroom and I was fighting him since I knew the pain would be unbearable if I got up, but he helped me up, got me ice, and gave me unisom.

z9aek2,AskDocs,5,"We wait 4 hours to be seen, the entire time I have my neck cranked on the back of the chair because having it forward alone caused pain. They do labs, give me a lidocaine patch, some tylenol, and an IV with zofran added, and while I didn't feel great, the pain was bearable. I go home, take a nap, wake up to the same pain I had prior. I just wanted to cry.",74
z9aek2,AskDocs,6,"It took 4 days for the pain to complete subside. I took 3 off of work to rest and use a heating pad, but every time I turned my head I felt the same pulsation of pain that makes me wince and feel like I will pass out.",48

My sister excused him by saying that he's a ""caffeine addict"" and that he gets ""cranky"" without his coffee like that makes it all right. And she's angry at me for saying he's not welcome at my house now. I can't believe he thinks it is acceptable to do that.

z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,24,"Use the correct words. Its not clear whether it hit or not, so he either assaulted you, or attempted to assault you. Ask your sister why you'd ever welcome back into your home someone who thinks its acceptable to assault you because they're cranky.",44
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,25,"Wait wait wait… he threw a plate at your head?! I’m sorry, but this **sounds** really funny, but are you ok?! A plate can really freakin hurt, can cut you, etc.",31
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,26,"You know, things I read on the internet everyday gets me to a point when nothing really should surprise me, but this… this is like wtf?!! He throw a plate at your head for not having Coffee. COFFEE!! This is not heroine or crystal meth. It’s f$&kin coffee.",48
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,27,You should tell your sister that he assaulted you and is not welcome to be around you ever again.,19
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,28,I mean who the hell throws a plate??? And over coffee??? A douche bag of a human. I hope your head is ok and the plate did not break.,29
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,29,"He is an abuser!! FFS, they sell coffee at many places, his lazy ass could go out and buy one, not throw a plate!!",24
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,30,OP tell me you threw him out immediately. This is assault.,11
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,31,Who the hell throws a plate to the person who hosted him for the night over something said host has no control over. God some peeps would need a good beating. Thats a piece of trash.,36
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,32,Emergency instant coffee (Starbucks Via) is a permanent fixture in my travel bag.,13
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,33,Shame on him (and her) for not sorting it out the night before. Or ordering something.,16
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,34,"If I wake up without access to coffee, that just gets me up earlier because I know I need to leave the house or hotel to find it elsewhere.",29
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,35,"Maintain your boundaries. ""Addiction"" is no excuse.",7
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,36,"I would have told him he has 5 min to get his shit and leave or i call the cops. Also there is no way he isn't abusing your sister, i'm so sorry OP.",34
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,37,You should report the matter to the police and get a restraining order.,13
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,38,I am thrilled you’re not injured OP! And very proud of you for banning him from your home!!,18
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,39,Have you reported him?,4
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,40,"Hmmm, he strikes me as the type that wouldn't behave this way with another man around. Not a good look.",20
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,41,Time to go no contact for both of them. Sorry this happened.,12
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,42,So he threw a plate at your head for not having a coffee maker. I’d be even more on earned at what he’s doing to her behind closed doors when he doesn’t get his way.,35
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,43,The dude sounds like a piece of shit and your sister sounds like an enabler. I'm glad it was just one night.,22
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,44,I like how she was the one to use the word “abuser” when you asked if his behavior was consistent. And then she was mad that you cared about what she would label as abuse if it happened to her.,40
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,45,"I wish I cared more about her outcomes, but you can’t fix this sort of thinking for her, and it’s probably not going to happen of her own volition for years, likely once there are children involved. I hope he’s impotent, I guess. It would be best to let her know that you’ll be around if she leaves and then focus on other things until that day.",67
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,46,If he hadn't done that he will. That is never ok.,11
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,47,Don’t let him in your house. Don’t go near him again.,11
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,48,I’m so sorry but your sister is definitely in an abusive relationship. She is just not ready to see it. But now you do so maybe that will help.,29
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,49,Rememer that SHE called him an abuser not you. Projection fo sho and she may be asking for help without asking for help. Keep an eye on it!,28
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,50,Congratulations your sister is shit. You don't need her,9
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,51,He’s clearly unhinged and your sister sounds like a fucking mop,11
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,52,WHAT THE FUCKKK😭😭😭😭😭,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,53,You're place your rules. An if he can't be an adult he can get the fuck out. And he most definitely dose the same with your sister.,27
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,54,"My mom, my dad and I are all caffeine addicts and none of us have thrown objects at each other because we were ""cranky for coffee"". The man's behaviour is ludicrous and so is your sisters justification of it. I'd give her an ultimatum since she clearly loves living in denial.",51
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,55,"Yea I drink caffeine every day and I’ve never assaulted someone because I didn’t have it, he isn’t an addict he’s just a piece of shit. I’m really tired of people using addictions as an excuse to act shitty",39
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,56,"If that's his reaction over something as petty as coffee, imagine what he's like with things that actually matter. Dude sounds like a ticking time bomb.",26
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,57,Clearly he has. Out on his ass he goes.,9
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,58,Make sure you tell the rest of the family!,9
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,59,"I’m a caffeine addict, but all I do is grumble, drink some water, and plot how to get the sweet nectar of the gods.",24
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,60,I don’t turn into an overgrown toddler mad because someone took away my favorite toy.,15
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,61,"If, for some bizarre reason I did throw a temper tantrum, my husband would be gone faster than a cat at a dog show.",24
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,62,Yes. He has done stuff like that to her.,9
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,63,"If my.gf threw a plate at my sisters head, I definitely wouldn't be defending her behaviour",16
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,64,Uh.... I'd of cracked the fucker in the face with a frying pan.,13
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,65,Neither my sister or her asshole would be allowed in my house after that.,14
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,66,What the fuck.,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,67,The fact that your sister got defensive when you asked if he had ever done that to her means yes he has 100% done that to her and she's normalized it.,31
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,68,>She knows my main account so this is a throwaway account.,11
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,69,"Ah yes, very clever, she'll never find out now",9
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,70,She's totally being abused.,4
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,71,Coffee and meth are not the same,7
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,72,Wow imagine what he does to your sister. You need to get your parents if you can and get her outta there,22
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,73,Should have punched him,4
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,74,"that's the definition of an abuser. consult with your parents, she definitely needs your help.",15
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,75,"He’s already proven he’s an abuser. If your sister thinks this is acceptable behavior, she’s a willing victim.",18
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,76,"Sounds like someone is protecting an abuser. I'm guessing they've been together for a while, and she doesn't want to leave a long term relationship? What do your parents/siblings have to say on the matter? I'm kind of surprised you didn't call police on him, that's vandalism, destruction of private property, and assault (at least in my state)",58
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,77,"Oh, she is being abused!!! Maybe not physically, yet, but surely some emotional or psychological abuse. Her quick defense of his actions without a true apology, and her anger at the mention of it are telltale signs.",37
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,78,"Blunt force trauma to the head is considered deadly force, same level as shooting someone in many states.",18
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,79,"While you might not able to get that charge, you certainly can at least get an assault charge on that asshole.",21
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,80,"I’m literally a coffee roaster who’s been a barista since I was 15, that guy is unhinged and his behavior is bullshit.",22
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,81,"I LOVE coffee. I can go on and on about how it was used for religious purposes at one point or how first-wave coffee culture helped us recover from the Great Depression in the US, how Starbucks contributed to second-wave coffee culture, and why I choose a third-wave approach to both roasting and brewing. I like going to coffee shops and sampling their coffee and guessing which country the beans came from. Like. I’m hardcore into coffee.",77
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,82,This isn’t someone being a caffeine addict. This is just someone being an asshole.,14
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,83,As a man who loves coffee (only drink it black) and has multiple cups in the morning.,17
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,84,"He's not a caffeine addict, he's a giant man-child asshole who I wouldn't ever help again.",16
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,85,caffeine is not cocaine. its not that addicting. the guy is just a violent piece of shit.,17
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,86,i drink coffee. its not very addicting. I drink cause i like the warmth in the morning. i can easily got weeks without having it.,25
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,87,Yup she's abused,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,88,"Wow, This is about coffee, But that idiot guy is going on like he's a heroine addict, Also make sure he isn't abusing your sister, And if he shouts alot, Get a bigger guy to go have a chat with that little boy.",43
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,89,"He is an abuser throwing a plate at someone bc they don’t own a coffee maker is deranged and abusive. You need to tell your family, your sister is most likely in an abusive relationship based on how she excused his horrid behavior",43
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,90,What a fucking man child I'm sure he's done shit like that to your sister and that is ridiculous. you are in the right to not have him over at your home anymore.,33
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,91,What is with all of these crybaby men who flip out and start throwing stuff when they get angry? The situation you described is really concerning. I hope your sister will come to her senses and realize this type of thing could and likely will increasingly escalate. I applaud you for being as calm and level headed as you were.,60
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,92,He probably hits her as well. ☹️,7
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,93,You need to check that dude. There’s disagreements and then there’s just being disrespectful. If you don’t take care of it now it will get worse.,26
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,94,"Honestly, I’d press charges if you can. Though I imagine your sister, the only witness, would lie to the cops when interrogated. Post this to your main account bc she needs to see that no, this isn’t him being “cranky” (is he a fucking toddler?!?!), it’s abuse.",47
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,95,>I asked my sister if he's ever done anything like that to her and she asked if I was calling him an abuser and got angry at me.,28
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,96,"Ok, so atleast your sister is not 100% delusional and realizes that plate throwing falls under abusive behavior.",18
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,97,">My sister excused him by saying that he's a ""caffeine addict"" and that he gets ""cranky"" without his coffee",19
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,98,So he's so much of an addict that he has no control over his own actions?? And your sister is ok with that.,23
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,99,"I would advise you to be kind to your sister and provide her with a safe place should she want to leave him. He may not have thrown things at her but he is definitely abusive to her in other ways, and she can't leave.",45
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,100,Hed be out on the street the same minute he threw my property to my head inside my own house.,20
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,101,Insane stuff.,2
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,102,"Well, if it throws a plate like an abuser...",9
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,103,Don't even talk to the prick at family events what a garbage person,13
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,104,That's messed up. I am a caffeine addict myself but I have never thrown any objects because I couldn't get a fix.,22
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,105,And there should be plenty of ways for him to get coffee without resorting to violence.,16
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,106,Fuck that guy!,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,107,He might be abusive and your sister is still in denial. Do not let him back in your house again. Remain firm. And keep an eye on your sister for bruises or anything else that could indicate he’s hurting her.,40
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,108,"Damn, he’s normalized this behavior that he was comfortable enough to do it to you, in your own house. Tell other family members and help her get iut of there",30
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,109,Yeah he's kicking her azz. You did the right thing. If sis is pissed she should stay the hell away too. What sister allows her immature boy toy to act so aggressively towards her own sister ?,37
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,110,Your sister is 100% being abused and she's in the idiot phase of it now - which is denial. Tell your family ASAP. I would also report him.,28
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,111,Your sister is regarded,4
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,112,Yeah that right there is assault. A crime. Tell your sister neither of them are ever allowed back there and should be more grateful you didn't press charges because I would have,32
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,113,"She's probably being abused herself, and in denial about it (thus the question of ""are you calling him an abuser?""). You're absolutely justified in not allowing him around you any more - that was in no way acceptable.",38
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,114,"I'm sorry that you're going through that - I hope you can stay in contact with your sister. She'll probably need it. If he's comfortable enough to do something like that around you, imagine how he acts around her. It might be worth it to ask her who else is calling him an abuser - but make sure she knows that you love her and are going to be there for HER, just not HIM. He may already be trying to isolate her from her support network. After all, that's what abusers do.",93
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,115,"Stay safe, OP.",3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,116,"""I'm withdrawing from my socially accepted addiction so I have a pass yo assault you.""",15
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,117,Fuck. That.,2
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,118,"If the sister is rationalizing that type of behavior… eek. She’s either as bad as him or is desensitized because he always is like this/abuses her (the latter feels more likely). That is a level ten reaction to a non-infraction. I hope you’re okay, OP.",45
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,119,"Holy shit if he has the gumption to do this to you, imagine what he’s doing to your sister behind closed doors. This is not cranky. This is abusive and batshit crazy.",32
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,120,Thays beyond being cranky about not getting caffeine. That was a tantrum how big a deal would it be to just go get some at a gas station or something?,30
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,121,Call it what it is. He's physically abusive.,8
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,122,He’s an abuser,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,123,Dude...,1
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,124,I mean you're so in the right I don't have much to add except I'm worried about your sister,19
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,125,"Get a fucking coffee maker, not rocket science",8
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,126,"This was my first thought too. There are plenty of places to grab coffee. Hell, the airport will have it if you don't pass one of the other dozen places you can buy a cup on the way.",38
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,127,Should have called the police for assault.,7
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,128,That definetly is abusive behaviours.,5
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,129,I also get cranky when I don\`t get coffee in the morning. You know what I do? I would look if I could get one somewhere else and if not I sulk inside myself for like 5 minutes and then I get over it and move on.,47
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,130,Yup she got Stockholm,4
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,131,"Yup. She didn’t answer the question with “No, never!”, she answered it with another question. Way to dance around the obvious.",21
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,132,"OP, you need to make yourself available to sister if ever she needs help getting away.",16
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,133,Exactly. The bf is an abusive idiot and there is a big chance the sister is in denial of being abused. Could help to open her eyes.,27
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,134,She's an abuse victim a d I'd be surprised if he doesn't already beat her,15
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,135,"Me too, except privately...no coffee means I have a legitimate excuse to go out for expresso. Out of milk? Guess I'll need to pop out and grab a cappuccino!",29
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,136,"My first thought, too. Like how many people’s sister’s boyfriends have thrown plates at their heads for the lack of a coffeemaker? Can’t be more than half a dozen. I think sister may make the connection here…",37
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,137,Missing the point here,4
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,138,Damn bro completely over your head huh 🤔,8
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,139,Possibly assault with deadly force. A lot of states consider blunt force trauma to the head the same level of deadly force as shooting someone.,25
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,140,I thought the exact same thing.,6
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,141,100% this make them late for the flight,8
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,142,"Sulk inside myself - hilarious, I’m taking it",8
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,143,I sulk when I run out of coffee too.,9
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,144,"Nah, that was the plate that got thrown at her for NOT HAVING A COFFEE MACHINE",16
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,145,Yeah it sucks..,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,146,Happy cake day!,3
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,147,Lol but why would she have one if she doesn’t drink coffee?,12
z9afef,TrueOffMyChest,148,To avoid getting plates thrown at her head.,8

z9ajyp,stepparents,2,"I (f 28) have established a life, career, and bought a house in a small community. I'm a bit tired of it but I have a great job. I started dating my partner (m 31) 2 years ago. We've had our troubles but we love each other and have a pretty great partnership.",53
z9ajyp,stepparents,3,"Issues: we are both pretty emotional, dominate people. We are busy. We sometimes struggle to communicate. We both struggle with anxiety and depression. HCBM. SD is kind of annoying to me but we get along great. I'm struggling with my attraction to him and sometimes feel like I could do better. Ie partner without kids and a psycho ex wife, someone that is less emotional, things like that. He can be snappy. He used to yell at me but he's made the adjustment. I feel like he works hard for me but we've also had trouble and I've been uncertain many times. It's created some tumultuousness but we keep growing and getting better. We both have trauma. There's a lot.",120
z9ajyp,stepparents,4,"Decision: per the updated CO, we are all to move and be within the same school district then share the kids every other week. Pro, it's near our families so I can be close to my sisters again. The kids (m 5 and d 7) have been separated for 3 years. We are FT with my SS and EOWE with SD. They have the same mom she, by her own admission, could not emotionally handle SS when he was 2 so he moved with dad.",85

z9ajyp,stepparents,6,HCBM is just.... HCBM. She's a raging jerk and tries to control our household and tell me what I should/shouldn't do. My partner is typically supportive. He empowers me and encourages me to parent. HCBM doesn't like that and I honestly get it but it's our home.,47

z9ajyp,stepparents,17,Personally.... at your age and under these circumstances I'd leave this situation,12
z9ajyp,stepparents,18,"It’s quite cute that at 28, you say you are young, but getting old. I assure you, 28 is still young, young! This is the time to live your life. If there’s a little dream in your heart to have the trendy condo in the big city (been there, done that, forever grateful I did), then do that! I moved to London, UK when I was 24, worked for a fashion photographer, dated foreign men, weekends in Paris, etc. Glad I did it, and it also made me more comfortable now with a slower pace of life, having that out of the system. I believe you have a desire for exploration of yourself for a reason. If you want to take emotions out of, statistically, majority of people end up married, and most with a family, so that dream is, in a sense, almost inevitable, unless it’s something you choose not to partake in. However, the dream of the big city is not something that will happen unless you actively seek it out. Much easier (and way more fun) to do in your late 20’s, then never have done it, and truly to re-live it later in life. Not to say it can’t happen, but it will likely be harder. Neither choice is “wrong” but think of which one might be easier to pivot from, should you wish to. Best wishes",231
z9ajyp,stepparents,19,"I always advise people to run. Even though my partner is the best partner I’ve ever had, the package deal blows.",21
z9ajyp,stepparents,20,If you want more perspective try reading the book StepMonster. It takes years for blended families to be fully integrated and there’s still problems in most. And the phrase “in a blended family someone always gets creamed” has been true for most I know (and it’s usually the stepmoms).,49
z9ajyp,stepparents,21,"People on this subreddit often ask if people would still chose step life knowing what they know now, and most seem to agree they wouldn’t. Or some say it’s only worth it because they have such a good partner, but it’s not a good life.",45
z9ajyp,stepparents,22,I would walk away.,4

z9ajyp,stepparents,25,"From a different, more practical standpoint: what’s the plan with your house? Are you expected to sell it? Is the expectation that you’d use that money on a down payment on a joint place? I 100% recommend against commingling long term investments in your future, like real estate, with someone you are not married to. This could become a real nightmare if you were to separate. You’re a homeowner at 28, have given yourself a big financial advantage, and I’m not really seeing how leaving that puts you ahead any.",90

z9ajyp,stepparents,27,Sounds like you are already considering the move as having more Pros than Cons listed. I would really recommend evaluating your reasons and not move for him or SK.

He really wants me to keep it in our portfolio as he has some properties too. He also helped with home improvement, financially. He's a very supportive partner.

z9ajyp,stepparents,36,You have your whole life ahead of you. If you're thinking you can do better - you can. At your age there are still plenty of other child free people on the market who you can start fresh with...without the baggage of SKs or a BM. And be able to enjoy some child free years before starting your own family. (If that's what you want),65
z9ajyp,stepparents,37,"I married my DH(51) at 41 and I wouldn't trade him for the world. His youngest is 14 so just a few short years of being free from BM, child support, etc. No way I could have coped with this with young kids where theres no light at the end of the tunnel. When I was your age I would have never dated someone with kids. Really, it's all those child free years I lived before my DH doing whatever I wanted that keeps me sane in my current situation dealing with SKs and BM....just knowing that having minor SKs is almost over.",103

I have absolutely zero energy after school. I don’t go to the gym anymore, I don’t have energy to cook so dinner is usually microwaved or cereal. Tonight I burst into tears when I realized I haven’t played with my cat for a few days. My home is neglected. Clothes are on the floor because I’m too exhausted to fold them and put them away. I have grad school classes two nights a week and then the rest of the week I get home, and essentially just wait until I think it’s acceptable to go to bed. I feel like I am putting 100% of myself into school and I have nothing left. I sleep for 8-9 hours every night. I know my diet affects my energy levels, but I can’t seem to find the energy (or the funds $) to buy and make myself healthy meals. I’ve never cried from exhaustion before now.

z9cvc1,teaching,24,Don't reinvent the wheel. Reach out to other teachers in your school or district and ask if they have resources or lesson plans that they are willing to share. Sure a lesson might not be perfect but if you're already overwhelmed it's better than burning out. The kids will not suffer because you don't have a perfect lesson plan every time.,61

They're just bitter fucks trying to assuage their own anxiety. **The fact that you are here at all means you've gone above and beyond**. There's absolutely no obligation to be an award-winning teacher, a ""transformative educator,"" or any of that other highfalutin bullshit. If you just do your job consistently at a minimal level, you're contributing more to society than most other members of the workforce.

z9cvc1,teaching,47,"I think teaching is different, now. The workload is astronomical, and the schools operate like cults that demand every minute of your time, including unpaid time. While grad school is difficult to do while you're teaching (I did this early on in my career.), something strange and concerning is happening in education. The role I once held has become so untenable, I resigned from my district recently due to multiple instances of toxic work environment. It seems my role now includes being bullied, and Idk if it is falling down the stairs at work, being evaluated by admin with no teaching experience, getting covid and subsequent struggles with cognition, fatigue, mood regulation, and joint pain, lock down drills, being falsely accused of abuse, being underpaid commensurate with my experience by administration, but it hardly seems worth all this effort, anymore. I am searching for the next thing, as this teaching business doesn't seem like something I want to participate in, anymore...it seems like post-pandemic, the expectations are outrageous on the part of school officials. I don't care for this trend of hiring bullies and retaining bullies into high positions, either.

z9cvc1,teaching,54,"Almost no one ever becomes a ""good"" teacher. What is asked of us, especially in this country, is essentially impossible to do well. So be realistic and accept that you are just learning to become the best teacher you can be. Don't try to be perfect and certainly don't worry too much about what the staff and faculty think of you as a ""teacher"". If you do this, you will work yourself into the ground (likely with little to no reward). Stick to your core values as a person and as a teacher.

Over time, probably after several years, you will see things come together.",129
z9cvc1,teaching,55,"As a first year, you will probably fuck up a lot. Observe your coworkers when you can (even if it's just hearing them out at staff meetings or checking out how/what they've decorated their classrooms with).

z9cvc1,teaching,61,Your first year is impossible. It is hell. I can’t imagine what it would be like with grad school on top of it.

With that being said, your struggle is real. It’s not easy. As a teacher, you are mentally engaged for 8 hours a day. Most workers have maybe 4 hours of real mental engagement.

You will always have a huge backlog of things which need to get done, and that's okay. And if you're a perfectionist, you're gonna need to get over that, too.

z9cvc1,teaching,78,"First off, I’m so sorry; honestly, just like everyone has said, the first year is so hard. I definitely remember feeling everything you’re saying (especially in the time between thanksgiving and Christmas). There were a few things that really helped me my first year (and continue to help me when I have really rough weeks). First, I’ve always been a runner, and I really stopped running the first couple months of my first year. I started making myself go run for 15 minutes (I live in the city and made my run part of my commute). Almost immediately, I felt like I got a little of myself back; it’s kind of wild what 15 minutes of fresh air and exercise can do. I also got really into meal prepping on the weekends; I tried to incentivize it (watching shows/movies I was looking forward to), and it turned into something I really look forward to even years later. The last thing that I think practically made a big difference was scheduling things during the week that I knew I wanted to do and then sticking with them. It can feel SO hard and isolating, but having something on a Tuesday evening that meant I literally couldn’t stay at work until 6 made a huge difference for me. Hope some of that helps! Mostly, you’re doing great, you can do this, AND you don’t have to do this. Give yourself grace and know that if you want to keep doing this, it will get better!",253
z9cvc1,teaching,79,17 years in..It doesn’t change.,5
z9cvc1,teaching,80,It will get better. You will build up your resources and not have to spend as much time on that. You should figure out the best way for you to be as organized as possible and that will help. As you get more comfortable in lesson planning you’ll get time back.

z9cvc1,teaching,82,"Something that has helped me is to find things that help me mentally reset on the weekend. If I can feel like I used my weekend to do something I enjoyed, was restful, or fun, or worthwhile but most importantly for myself I can make it through Wednesday on that feeling. After that I hang in there until the weekend again. Also this is just me but relaxing games that I can spend hours in without thinking about anything else such as Stardew Valley or Pokemon really help with the burnout when I get home. That said, everything is still a mess at home and I'm still not eating well but at least I'm not miserable all the time.",119

z9cvc1,teaching,88,"I am also in the process of getting masters. 4th year teaching Art (first year was COVID year). It honestly does get better .. but it is still always going to be exhausting. What has helped me greatly is setting strict boundaries. I do not do work after I get out unless it’s some sort of urgent matter like grades being due. Use your time efficiently while at work and most importantly, let go of having everything be perfect. If it doesn’t get done, then it doesn’t get done. Oh well. Also for food I find that buying pre prepared/seasoned meats and pre chopped vegetables makes cooking easy. Just stick it in the air fryer. As for working out, aim for only 2 days a week. As long as you are moving a lot at work (which I know we are a lot as teachers), and eating within your calorie range for the day, you will be more than fine. I know exactly how you feel. I still feel this way sometimes but then I just tell myself to stop caring as much and it helps tremendously.",187

unknown,unknown,4,To be fair with how terrible education has been in the last decade only those that are gullible enough are left teaching.,22
unknown,unknown,5,Welcome to the gullibility group.,5
unknown,unknown,6,I got some ideas/hypotheses that I think apply to two root factors of your problem,15
unknown,unknown,7,**Conclusions**,1
unknown,unknown,8,"One conclusion strongly guides thinking, planning and decisions. For example, if one concludes ""I hate broccoli"", he/she will reject broccoli and any food make with it. It the hated thing is a person, he/she will not want to interact with or maybe even stay near the person.",47
unknown,unknown,9,"So, when you conclude ""I am exhausted"", this has an effect in your thinking, planning and decisions. The point is: is it fully true? Consider a scenario that you're feeling extremely exhausted and your house catches fire; you will certainly have energy to do something.",45
unknown,unknown,10,"The simplest way I know to question such conclusions is to make a question out of it: ""Do I hate broccoli?"", ""Am I exhausted?"" Some emphasis may help: ""Am I *really, completely* exhausted??"". This opens the conclusion and makes it easier or less difficult to do something.",47
unknown,unknown,11,**Connections**,1
unknown,unknown,12,"The best days I use to have at work is when I *complete* tasks. When something remains pendent and I ""take it home"", that's when I get more tired. The days with several pendencies are the worst.",37
unknown,unknown,13,"We have *connections* to things, persons, problems, tasks. A connection is associated with some *feeling*. When we complete something, we can disconnect from it; we don't feel it anymore. To ""take a task home"" means that we keep the connection with the task active. In the ideal scenario, we keep a connection active only when we dedicate to it; an active connection with something else is a distraction, an interference.",70
unknown,unknown,14,"I think that you are ""taking the problems home""; technically, you keep active whatever you felt something about. In other words, and as you have undesirable feelings about your experiences, you keep feeding the connections and this becomes a cycle.",40
unknown,unknown,15,"So, what to do? To fight such connections is a lost battle, they are reinforced by the attention they receive. Tire the body works for me, but sometimes a get into a state similar to yours and have to find another option. The simplest and best solution to me is to connect to another thing, for example some activity that you love do do. In fact, anything that deviates your attention from the problem will work; so, simply *start the search for a solution* is a step in the right direction.",91
unknown,unknown,16,"Hope this helps, I'd appreciate honest and pitiless feedback.",9
unknown,unknown,17,>Take a personal/sick day once a month and do nothing. Work only your contract hours. Leave work at work.,19

unknown,unknown,21,That first year of teaching AND grad work is beyond exhausting. The bit about not going to the gym was esp. relatable. By the end of that first year I looked like a skeleton.,34
unknown,unknown,22,"Remember the minimum passing grade for your classes and work to be a svelt but safe margin above that. You are learning so much, and practicing so many skills, that it is almost impossible for you to be a """"""""""good teacher"""""""""" and meet ALL the expectations put on you.",49
unknown,unknown,23,"If you stick with it and survive the year, all this will be a laughable memory when you get to your second year. Because then you're able to implement all the classroom strategies you've been working on, ON DAY 1, BABY!! That's the good shit! It makes a world of difference, and I'm stoked for you to experience it.",59
unknown,unknown,24,"I cannot describe how much better your second year of teaching will be. So long as you focus on this year being your chance to learn, practice, and make mistakes! & don't you fucking LOOK at that work email before or after work hours, so help me Dewey.",48

unknown,unknown,27,"I am not sure that working to contract is the best advice in a teachers first year. In general, it takes a while to hit the learning curve and sometimes overwork is just part of the deal early on. Having said that, you need to take care of yourself. Stress and the accompanying depression/anxiety that comes with it cannot be slept off like a flu. You just have to move. Walk around the block a few times. But don’t just give in to gravity. Gravity is not your friend. Even moderate exercise is better than any medication. And I oughta know.",101
unknown,unknown,28,On the subject of mental health days: it sometimes helps to get signed off for intermittent FMLA. You will wanna reach out to your Primary Care Provider or a therapist to help with this documentation. It ensures that you are protected from administrative action for the absences.,47

unknown,unknown,51,"I totally get what you’re saying. And I’ve thought about it a lot. But what makes a first year teacher different from any other teacher? How many first year teachers suffer so badly that they quit? If teacher programs aren’t preparing teachers to teach, something has to change. It shouldn’t just have to be, welp everyone had a really shitty first year, good luck and do your best. What would it look like if first year teachers worked to contract like anyone else? My teacher mentor when I was in grad school, stayed after school until at least 6pm every day. I had a principal who said teachers should stay until the work is finished. This mentality needs to change. My argument is that teachers would learn time management even sooner and they letting go of things is ok if they left on time.",144

I figure if I’m responsible for educating the next generation, I’d better hold myself to the appropriate standard I’d hold them to.",73

I used to sit there at various restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, etc staring out the window for hours on slow days miserable out of my mind, dreaming of being anywhere else. I would do it all again. I have gotten better at many things, and other things are a work in progress. My biggest advice is be a fair, kind, funny hardass as soon as you can in the year. Drink water. Eat well. Don't take things personally. Know that you will lose sleep, lose weight, and feel overwhelmed, and be prepared for that. My administration and colleagues are supportive enough and my coach is AMAZING but doesn't know my content area. Lesson planning and grading are huge learning curves but admin will look more at classroom management in my experience. Drink whatever Kool aid your school is pushing, for us it's PBIS and relevancy statements, but be realistic about your abilities. And above all remember that you have to teach the kids you have. No amount of complaining will transform your students into what you expect of them. They are who they are. You can't teach students who aren't there--so don't try. Best of luck to you <3",216
unknown,unknown,56,Just because you aren't at work or doing work tasks doesn't mean that your body is at rest.,18
unknown,unknown,57,"Make a list of things that make you feel truly rejuvenated and require little energy and try to do at least one or two of those things each night. Then, on your days off, seriously dive into those fulfilling passions. It can be easy to fall into a spiral of low-input dopamine seeking tasks (like reddit lmao) but those rarely allow our minds rest and rejuvenation.",66
unknown,unknown,58,"Another thing that took time for me to master: Feel justified in saying no to as many invitations/obligations as you need to in order to thrive mentally/emotionally. This is a marathon, not a sprint.",34
unknown,unknown,59,"Meditation and yoga helped tremendously. I never was too rigorous, but it focused me to be present in the moment, which helped me recognize the work stuff I was bringing home.",31
unknown,unknown,60,"I did a post on another sub about “educational martyrs“. Many teachers had something to say about this. I got close to 1000 comments, most like me, had very little patience for the type of teacher who puts in 12 hours a day without any compensation. The pay they get is the right to humble brag. It’s not just that they work hard and long hours. It’s they work harder and longer than YOU do. And of course, they have to let you know or else all that work they did was in vain. Because I don’t believe for a minute that they are doing it for all “the kids“. We’re all fucking doing it for the kids! These people undermined their peers at contract negotiations. The administration puts them on a pedestal wrap some shiny wrapping paper and put some ribbon on therefore head. See! If these people can work all these extra hours without pay that you should be able to do it too. Aren’t you in it for the kids?",173

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,1,"I (25f) am getting married to my fiance next month. The wedding planning has been a smooth process and we've had no issues until late last week. I invited a friend (N) from school, we've been friends for 12 years and have drifted apart due to life. She has always been quiet and not one to open up much, but Ive witnessed her unwavering support for the lgbtq+ community numerous times. N got into a relationship about 4 years ago and had a baby with the man (L) last year. I met L at her baby shower and he seemed decent until I noticed some things, such as complaining that his son will not be using a pink colored teething ring and that the gender neutral clothing looked too 'girly', and that he answered quite a few questions for N, stared her down and would white knuckle her knee every time she tried to give a different answer. I wholeheartedly believe she is being abused, because she is so quiet and doesnt stand up for herself.",176
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,2,"The main issue is that my gay sister and a few of my gay/bisexual cousins and friends are in my wedding party, and L does not like that. They (mostly L) called me last week to let me know how disrespectful it was to god that Ive allowed ""the homos to infiltrate a sacred god ordained union"". I laughed and hung up. N called me some hours later when she was alone and apologized for L's behavior, but told me she cant do anything about that. I asked her if she truly felt the way about my wedding that L claimed she did, and she sat quiet for about a minute before she laughed a bit and let an I dont know slip out of her mouth. I let her know that because of recent events regarding the lgbtq community here in Colorado I will be protecting my family and friends by not taking any chances, and therefore she and L are uninvited from my wedding. If anyone is wondering how they found out about my family being lgbtq+, me and fiance started a large group chat of friends/family to get to know eachother, and a few relatives have shocked me by their vitriolic contempt for the lgbt community, so they have been uninvited as well for safety, and fiance agrees.",221

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,25,Absolutely NTA. Protect your family.,5
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,26,THANK YOU FRIEND FOR PROTECTING THE BRETHERIN IN COLORADO. As a proud member of the lgbtq community I thank you for supporting your family. Protect them and when you get the chance. Kick that sorry sack of false Christian shit in the nuts. As a Christian (I know right two in one crazy) I find it horrible he claims god gives a dam. Quite frankly people are murdering and raping each other and destroying the planet. I don't think god gives a fuck who you have sex with. Or if you don't have sex. Not the point. I just don't believe god cares that much. If he is truly loves us all. He won't care who we love or who we are. So again thank you and kick L in the nuts.,132
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,27,"NTA - but if you care about your friend at all, I would strongly suggest that you make it very clear to her that uninviting her from the wedding does not mean that you want to break the friendship with her, and that if she ever needs help your door will always remain a crack open.",56
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,28,"If you are right, and if she is in a DV relationship, then isolating her from her friends, family and basically support system is a big portion of abusers strategy; and sadly often the support system helps with that by cutting them both out for the abusers shitty behavior - and that then over time creates an even bigger hurdle for the victim to get over, if she decides to leave but thinks that then she will be all on her own.",82
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,29,"Also, if you can, try to get some information to her (if it’s safe), like a copy of “Why does he do that” and the number of the National DV hotline just in case.",34

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,31,"NTA, you could call her up acknowledging that she may be going through a hard time herself (assuming she's forced to say what she said), but you can't do anything about it and her husband is unwelcome to your wedding, period. And for safety reasons (that she should know about) her invitation is also revoked. She probably can't come alone anyways.",61
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,32,The other friends calling you AH are potential uninvitees as well,11
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,33,"NTA. Unwavering support which collapses as soon as the person faces any conflict or potential consequence for it isn't unwavering, it's just untested.",23

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,35,"Maybe message your mutual friends: ""L gave me homophobic rant saying he spoke for them as a couple. I spoke to N one-on-one and asked her if she truly shared L's views and she said 'I don't know'. You all know that N goes nowhere without L. As N is no longer strongly against being associated with homophobia I am choosing to protect my family from being exposed to homophobic rants. People are murdering LGBTQ people, I am not the AH for wanting my wedding to be a safe space for my family during such a dark time for gay rights. I hope the N we all remember who would never tolerate homophobia resurfaces one day. Do you honestly see that happening before my wedding date? You all are going to be in my shoes one day, having to decide how best to protect the people you love from bigotry. So I ask you respect the way I have chosen to handle this even if it's not how you will navigate the same situation when your time comes.""",178
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,36,NTA,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,37,It’s sad but there’s nothing you can do about N. As cruel as it sounds it’s literally impossible to help someone out of an abusive marriage unless they are actively seeking to leave it themselves. Not tiptoeing around it and showing her how ridiculous and vile her husband is acting is as close as you can get.,57

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,39,"NTA, your options were to have biggots spewing hate at your wedding and making some of your loved ones feel unsafe and potentially not attending, or not putting up with this behavior and creating a safe and loving environment for your family and friends to celebrate your love. You chose correctly. Sorry to hear about your friend though.",58
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,40,"NTA. Your friend is being manipulated and abused, and it’s safe to say that if N were to be invited, bad things could and likely would happen because of L. Regardless, you need to support your friend and help her out of this relationship, because this is clearly toxic to the point of being dangerous.",55
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,41,NTA for uninviting them. But please have a private conversation or talk to her family with her about the possible abuse. People are often brainwashed by their abusers.,28
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,42,NTA. Safety comes first. You could keep low contact with N for support in case she ever decides to leave L but you can't do much more.,27

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,46,"NTA. Does it suck for your friend? Absolutely but she better get used to it because it sounds like her SO is a jerk so they will get left out a lot. Also, having people like that at your wedding isn’t safe for your guests and will make you nervous the whole night worrying about something happening. You don’t need that and your guests don’t need that. Anyone that thinks you are TA for uninviting homophobic people needs to open their eyes and read the news. It’s a scary place and not getting better.",94

I’ve lost two long time friends because they have fallen down some of the batshit crazy stuff that’s said about the LGBTQ+ community (one used to say she was non-binary but now believes the worst about trans people, the other identified as pansexual but is not dating an openly homophobic man) so I understand the pain and I understand how hard it is to watch people just…change.

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,59,"NTA. You can be there for her if she needs an escape but ultimately, you cannot do anything to save her from an abusive relationship if she herself doesn’t want or isn’t ready to leave it. There’s no reason for you to also put up with their judgmental rhetoric. It will not help N and it certainly won’t say anything good about you to your family.",66
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,60,"NTA. She married a homophobic and just because it is an abusive relationship (or it could be one), does not mean you need to put your friend and family's safety at risk for her and her partner.",37

I had to cut her off cos she started treating her brother like shit too.",64
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,64,"NTA. Let her know she has your support when she’s ready to leave that situation, but having them at your wedding is out of the question after his behaviour. Can’t imagine he‘s going to be upset about not having to attend that disrespectful gathering.",44

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,75,"I (25f) am getting married to my fiance next month. The wedding planning has been a smooth process and we've had no issues until late last week. I invited a friend (N) from school, we've been friends for 12 years and have drifted apart due to life. She has always been quiet and not one to open up much, but Ive witnessed her unwavering support for the lgbtq+ community numerous times. N got into a relationship about 4 years ago and had a baby with the man (L) last year. I met L at her baby shower and he seemed decent until I noticed some things, such as complaining that his son will not be using a pink colored teething ring and that the gender neutral clothing looked too 'girly', and that he answered quite a few questions for N, stared her down and would white knuckle her knee every time she tried to give a different answer. I wholeheartedly believe she is being abused, because she is so quiet and doesnt stand up for herself.",176
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,76,"The main issue is that my gay sister and a few of my gay/bisexual cousins and friends are in my wedding party, and L does not like that. They (mostly L) called me last week to let me know how disrespectful it was to god that Ive allowed ""the homos to infiltrate a sacred god ordained union"". I laughed and hung up. N called me some hours later when she was alone and apologized for L's behavior, but told me she cant do anything about that. I asked her if she truly felt the way about my wedding that L claimed she did, and she sat quiet for about a minute before she laughed a bit and let an I dont know slip out of her mouth. I let her know that because of recent events regarding the lgbtq community here in Colorado I will be protecting my family and friends by not taking any chances, and therefore she and L are uninvited from my wedding. If anyone is wondering how they found out about my family being lgbtq+, me and fiance started a large group chat of friends/family to get to know eachother, and a few relatives have shocked me by their vitriolic contempt for the lgbt community, so they have been uninvited as well for safety, and fiance agrees.",221
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,77,"A few mutual friends are calling me an asshole and unreasonable for what Ive done, because we've all seen N's support for the community firsthand, and we've all seen the manipulative behavior from L and know she is possibly being abused. Unfortunately I dont feel I can do anything further and Im going to do what I feel is right to protect my family. So, AITA?",66

I would be concerned for your friend too, but letting them come to the wedding is not going to improve her situation at all and puts everyone else there at risk of verbal (or worse) abuse. I think you did the right thing. I've got no patience in my life for racist or sexist or homophobic people, there are too many great people out there to waste time on them!",71
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,86,NTA you have to protect your family and guests.,9

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,93,"NTA. It’s unfortunate that she may be in an abusive relationship. However, you can support her and still maintain boundaries that you will not tolerate homophobia. Her spouse is not welcome at the event. If she cannot or will not come alone, then unfortunately, she will have to sit this one out. Offer her your friendship and assistance but with the caveat that you will not endure or ask others to endure her husband’s bigotry.",75
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,94,NTA. Didn’t even have to read it to know that. Hanging out with homophobes and racists means you would be complicit in their views. Keep them both far away,29
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,95,"NTA. Doesn't matter if she supported them in the past, if she can't answer a direct question about how she feels about your wedding then she deserves to be disinvited. Of course L should not go, and probably should not be invited to future events either.",46

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,100,NTA. You should Uninvite your friends who are complaining that you’re not inviting bigots to your wedding.,17

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,103,"As sad as that is...so what? Even if she is being abused, I don't think your wedding day is the best time to try and sort her marriage situation. Like, how would you proceed? You can help her all you want (if she needs it) after. No need to bring the drama on your wedding day. The fact that not even during that private phone call without him present, she wasn't even able to reply with a clear ""NO, IM NOT HOMOPHOBIC"" says a lot. Protect yourself first.",88

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,107,NTA I'm sorry you can say you support people all you want. you can go on all the marches you want. but when you marry a bigot and perpetuate b******* that's your own problem. you are obviously not who everyone thought you were I'm sorry she's being abused or neglected or controlled by an idiot man. she chose that . she does not have to continue to choose that. she could decide to be a decent human being.,78
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,108,"Oof. This is one hell of a catch-22. Disinviting your friend runs the risk of further entrenching the isolation her potentially abusive husband may be trying to force on her. Allowing them both to come clearly guarantees him making a scene and verbally/emotionally mistreating any LGBTQ+ loved ones in attendance and may feel like cosigning his beliefs. There are no good choices here, only harm reduction choices.",67
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,109,"Realistically, weddings and similarly high stakes emotional events are not good places to do the work of trying to preserve a friendship being broken down by an abusive partner. No one is going to have the emotional bandwidth to handle a crisis or problem well and since it's high stakes that's likely to end in hurt feelings all around. This feels like a good time to reach out to your friend and kindly offer a method of regular communication at least somewhat protected from her husband's interference before letting her know that you cannot allow her husband to attend your wedding, and while you are not explicitly univiting her, she is welcome to say or do whatever she needs to in order to keep herself safe, and you will not hold those decisions against her. Tell her you love her and want only her happiness, and that you hope she stays in touch, and then make sure someone is on hand to turn him away if necessary.",167

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,111,NTA Op this is your wedding to have with family. She is not a good friend at all and should not be a friend. She will only add bigotry to your life instead of adding anything positive. This is the time when you let her go. She is homophobic so she can lie in the bed she made by daring to throw her gods opinion at you about your life. You don’t need her negativity as you are doing everything right by protecting your family from homophobic people.,88

If you wanted to be REALLY antagonistic, they could all dress up in dark clothes with sunglasses and make a caption about infiltrating the wedding. 😂 I am sorry about your friend, though. Assuming she’s always been an ally, it stands to reason that she might feel pressured to be this way because of him. Maybe he didn’t always act like this. Who knows? It’s best to keep your people safe, though. There’s not much you can do besides that at the moment.",100
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,115,"NTA. You mentioned that she is potentially being abused by her partner . It is possible that she does not agreed with her partner ‘s views and defends him or not say anything out of fear . You have every right to tell them not to come , I would be worry too if that guy is at the wedding due to recent terrible event that happened in Colorado. And your mutual “friends” for their lack of understanding and insensitivity and of course her partner are the assholes in this . On that note , I hope your friend can safely get out that toxic ( potentially abusive ) relationship soon as possible . I wouldn’t be surprised if her partner’s awful views on LGBTQ+ community plus his manipulative behavior is the reason she may feel that she can’t voice her true opinions and agreed with him out of fear and retaliation.",152
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,116,Very much NTA,3
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,117,"Yes, she is likely being abused. And you know what a lot of mass shooters have in common? A history of domestic violence. It’s terrible that the world has come to this, but it’s completely reasonable for you to be afraid for your friends’ safety in this situation.",48

I know for a fact my family wouldn’t uninvite someone from their wedding for being homophobic, even if they weren’t close to them. you’re doing the right thing, and I guarantee this means a lot to your family. imo, this is what being an ally looks like - making hard decisions that benefit and support the queer community even when they may cause controversy and contempt.",114

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,131,"NTA. Always protect your family first. I would have done the same thing as you. There’s no place for bigotry and hatred in polite society. However, if you can find a way to privately let your friend know that there are resources out there to help her out of an abusive relationship, I would do that as well. It sounds like she’s being coached into saying what her partner wants to hear and I worry for her safety. But your instinct to protect your family is spot on, so don’t budge on that front.",94
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,132,Unless they are using the wedding to get her out of the situation like they’re Oskar Schindler there is nothing wrong with disinviting her.,24
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,133,You probably should take some very serious steps to address your friends safety though.,14

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,136,"While you are NTA for deciding not to invite your friend, I think the title of this post is rather misleading. the title paints N as being newly homophobic, but you admit it sounds more like she’s possibly being abused and suppressed by her husband. You might want to edit that if you can, because it comes across a bit that you’re judging her to be homophobic for not standing up to her husband, even though you suspect she’s being abused.",81
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,137,"again, NTA for keeping her out of the wedding to keep the peace, but see if you can reach out to her separate from the wedding to see if she’s alright.",31
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,138,"NTA. People change. She may have been supportive before, but clearly that has changed for her.

Are you worried for their actual physical safety, which seems a bit far-fetched, or are you worried that this guy might say something to hurt someone's feelings? Depending on how much you value your friendship with N, you need to carefully evaluate whether you have a legitimate safety concern or are you just virtue signaling on behalf of your gay friends/family? Also consider how important it is (or isn't) to your friend to attend. You say you've drifted apart; maybe she really doesn't care about attending your wedding and viewed your invitation as a solicitation for a wedding present... (The whole thing about her narcissistic husband is a wholly separate issue.

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,182,"N may have done a ""lot"" in the past for the community, but she's absolutely showing that her support is conditional when it comes to her own personal comfort. And, guess what, that's absolutely not good enough, especially right now, to guarantee the well-being and safety of anyone LGBT at the wedding. If she's being abused, the safest course of action would not be centered around inviting N to the wedding and/or keeping her involved with the event, but for OP to say that she would support N if and when she needs help leaving.",95
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,183,"This. Help your friend get out of there if you can, but keep yourself and your loved ones safe. NTA",20
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,184,"All of this, but id also extend an olive branch to the friend to let her know op will help her if she needs to leave, that is textbook signs of abuse and the fact that he's so blatant about it in front of people means it is escalating",49

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,186,"exactly, people expect us to continue to let ourselves be killed and maimed for their delicate heterosexual sensibilities pero I'm not taking any chances! It really sucks that your friend is being abused but it's up to the abused person to ask for help. right now she's just helping him be a homophobe and spread hateful rhetoric, enabling him by saying it's okay and continuing to not only date said homophobe but saying ""I don't know"" to whether or not she agrees with him. I would tell her ""I don't know"" if I can be friends with such a violent homophobe",101

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,196,I came here to say exactly that! What is to gain by inviting her to the wedding? She most likely would be uneasy about her SO doing something stupid and not fully enjoy the wedding anyway.,36

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,200,This.,1
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,201,"I would add that you could tell her specifically what support you could offer if she ever felt the need to leave her husband. Could you give her a ride to a shelter, offer her a room in your house, or help her get a bus ticket to a relative? Knowing what her options would be if she needed to leave can be the thing that helps her get free ultimately. Ideally she would make a safety plan for what to do if her situation became untenable.",87

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,204,"This woman clearly sounds like she is in a Domestic Violence relationship, and leaving DV abusers is most often not easy at all - not the least due to the fact that often the abuse significantly escalated when the victim is leaving and the abuser fears that he is losing control; also btw the time when a majority of lethal incidences occur.",62
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,205,"Of course she should leave (safely), as soon as she can for many reasons; but quite frankly the guy being a homophobe probably *right now* is not exactly on the top of her immediate concerns (that might be more: “I hope he does not hurt me or kill me today”).",50
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,206,"And if anyone responds saying she's in an abusive relationship, point out it takes people in an abusive relationship 7 times to successfully leave. And they only leave when they want to. N doesn't want to leave yet and you don't know how long it's going to be until she does, or if she will ever want to leave. So your wedding isn't the time or place to force these difficult conversations & somewhere deep down, N knows that before L she would have made the same choice you're making now.",91
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,207,"She did not choose to be abused, and it can be extrememly difficult to leave abusive situations, especially when a child is involved. She may actually still support the community but she may be too terrified to let me know because she is being held under her boyfriends thumb. If she had told me she was still supportive, what if he was listening from the other room and decided to hurt her after she hung up?

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,224,"1. Yes, I am without a doubt 100% concerned for their physical safety as well as their mental well being, so I am taking precautions. There are insane people everywhere, and literally anyone could snap at any moment! People in the community are being unalived solely for whom they choose to love or how they identify. Im developing a slight agoraphobia over the last few years simply because of this and its taking a lot out of me mentally to have over 100 people, all with different mental illnesses, backgrounds, and perspectives in the same room already. 2. The state of my friendship with N has nothing to do with my decision. If we hadnt talked in 10 years, or if we were as close knit as two people possibly could be, I would still be making the decision to keep my loved ones safe. I never stated that her boyfriend was a narcissist, I just know that what I witnessed was abusive behavior, those two things are not exclusive. 3. Ive asked guests not to bring gifts as me and my fiance have everything we need and want, because this is a celebration of love that we want to share with no obligations.",204
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,225,"Even if she is being abused, she called OP back when L wasn't around to apologize for his behavior. So when she laughed and said she didn't know if she agreed with what he said, she wasn't under any kind of threat which might have prevented her from speaking freely. (Presumably, if L had, say, cameras that also pick up audio, or bugged her phone, or something, she wouldn't have called OP to apologize for L in the first place, so she at least thought she could speak freely.)",89
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,226,"This is very important. He is trying to isolate her so she will have no escape route. Make it very clear that while she is not invited to the wedding, you will help her in find a safe place to stay if she ever decides to leave him.",48

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,228,It’s also not easy for abused people to ask for help. Saying that the abused person is enabling a homophobe by not standing up to him is blaming the victim for not standing up to the abuser.,37
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,229,"It is very common for people to say “I don’t know” when they’re stuck in a situation like this.

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,230,"I’m not saying that OP should invite the friend and the husband, because Op definitely shouldn’t. But what I’m saying is that the friend has supported lgbt people in the past.

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,231,"I feel that is what is happening too. My aunt has been in an emotionally abusive relationship for the last 16 years. Over the years she began to repeat his points of view even when he is not around. It's been drilled into her head so many times I think she has come to believe that this is what she truely believes. OP could try and keep the invitation for N and only disinvite L, but N wouldn't show up without him. In this environment you can't allow the chance that L will show up with N, so they both will have to be cut from the guest list. If I was OP, I would still make sure that N knows that this is really about L and that OP will help her should she ever want to leave L. NTA.",141

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,233,"N probably is genuinely scared of him. But OP can’t save her unless she wants to be saved and that’s the sad reality of it. If she tries to make N leave now, it’s highly likely that N will end up going back to him anyway.",46
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,234,"‘Oh it’s not that bad’ ‘he didn’t mean to hurt me, he said he’s sorry’ ‘he only said it because of xyz’. Those are the glasses.

OP could tell N until she’s blue in the face about all the bad things about L, but it doesn’t mean N is going to listen.",69
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,235,"People who have been in abusive relationships for a while end up going back to their abuser several times because it’s the devil they know. Sometimes they don’t get out until it gets really bad, sometimes they don’t get out before it’s too late. N has to want to leave, but I think it’ll be hard for her now, especially with their baby. I think if OP wants to be a good friend, she’ll always offer to be there for support and be ready to jump in and help when the day finally comes that N wants to leave. OP won’t be able to rescue her before that day.",109
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,236,"I’ve been in N’s situation. Twice. And it got worse and worse and worse and I didn’t leave no matter what. My second ex even threatened to stab me in the stomach with a knife while our son was laying in his Moses basket across the room. And I still didn’t leave him then. Because he had such a hold on me. He came back every time with apologies and flowers and loads of gifts and would get on his knees and beg for forgiveness, and I took him back every time because he made me believe that I was a horrible human being and that he was the only person who would ever want to be with me and I believed him. With everything he did to me, it took him kicking the crap out of me whilst holding our son for me to leave. I don’t know if you’ve ever been the situation, and I pray that you never have been, but it’s different for everyone and it’s easier to make comments looking in on the situation. I can make judgements about N and L’s relationship based off of what OP wrote, but I’ll never know their situation for sure.",202
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,237,That’s fair. I don’t think OP is wrong not to want the guy anywhere near them though. Hopefully they can get her out.,23
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,238,While being abused you start to change yourself for your partner you try to become more likable it’s practically brainwashing. She could have been confused and laughed as a nervous reaction,31
z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,239,"as someone who has been abused and is both B and T I can't agree less. it is not the job of those around us to get us out of these situations and besides, it seems like OP has voiced concerns and the abuse isn't under the table. I'm sorry but abuse victim or not it is perpetuating homophobia. To the abuser she isn't going along with it because he's an abuser she's going along with it because she agrees and if she agrees then others agree and now not only are his actions of abuse okay but his homophobic ideology. I'm not going to pretend it's okay my best friend is saying I'm sinful and disgusting even if it's ""because"" of their abuser",124

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,242,"Several people, including my Stepmum, have made comments about me going back to my ex. I shut that shit down so fast.

z9dljb,AmItheAsshole,243,"He threw me down the stairs after forcing me to live in garbage for months. He drank everyday and smoked weed like it was going to made illegal again.

z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,39,Nope. Cps always told her when to expect a visit. It was dumb.,13
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,40,Did they ever speak to the kids? They really should,10
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,41,Yes they did. We were brain washed. I was so scared I would be separated from my brother and sister. My bio had terrified me with tales of foster care. She was mostly mean to me. I knew handle that. I didn't know what would happen in foster care. This was before the internet being cheap and easy. ( Early 90s ) We didn't even get a phone until I was 16. We were brain washed. She would make us pack a bag and load into the car while telling us horrific things about foster care and stop at a random corner of a random rd drop us off and leave for hours. She would come back sometimes right away other times after hours and say things like even foster care doesn't want us. That we were so worthless that they(foster care ) didn't even want us. We didn't have any family. Just bio mom and the 3 of us.,160

z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,43,The neighbors shot his hunting dog so he got in an altercation with themwith a gun. Police showed up he was shot and killed by the police. I was 3-4 years old. ( he was a drunk and both bios did drugs off and on),45
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,44,Holy shit. So both parents were classy people then. I'm really glad you're out of there. Are your siblings out too?,21
z9dnod,raisedbynarcissists,45,Yes and no. Bio died in 2019. So we r free. However none of us have a relationship with each other. Trauma is a cycle. We have all hurt each other over the years bc we didn't know any better. Therapy for 8 years taught me that I can't just pretend it didn't happen so they don't like me bc I won't sugar coat what happened. Right now none of us talk to each other. Idk if that will ever change. 😕,82

z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,3,"So I’m thinking about buying a truck and stocking it full of good tools. Things like lang, koken, lisle, nepros, wright, gray pneumatic, sunnex, mayhew, gear wrench, vim, ez red, etc. the point is to have good stuff and a great selection at fair prices.",45

z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,5,Have you ever been on an independent truck? Would you give one a try? Am I missing anything?,18
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,6,Thanks!,1
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,7,I’m sure you probably already know this but I’d reach out to the Mobile Tool network and see what it would take to get setup with them as a first step. I think an independent guy can make it as long as you’re good to your customers. Also take a look at what the Jersey Discount Tool guys carry those are the brands that would be worth selling too.,69
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,8,I had an independent for years. Get you anything you wanted. Super nice guy. Did business with him so long I didn’t have a truck credit limit with him.,29
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,9,I think you’re hurdle will be the lack of revolving credit line and warranty work. The truck functions as a line of credit for both the techs and the owner. Without the backing of the company your float will be difficult to manage. If you have experience managing multiple net 30/60/90 accounts with separate businesses then you have a leg up but it will be tricky.,66
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,10,"How are you planning on purchasing your stock? If a tool breaks, are you backing it? Will you swap it on the spot and send in the old one on your own credit?",33

z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,13,"I’m not saying it’s not possible, just saying there is a reason it’s not more prolific. I am also not supporting the snap on mode either. I almost bought a truck about 5 years ago but ultimately decided it wasn’t worth it. Snap on purposely keeps their trucks at about $100k a year net. If you exceed it then good for you, but your route will be divided up sooner or later. Owning multiple routes and hiring drivers/salesman to run the route at say 80% of net is really the only way it would be “worth it” in my book. The ability to order tools straight from snap ons website also didn’t sit well with me. The truck basically becomes a credit card (that you under sign) and a warranty spot. The only people that need the truck are the people that need to make payments.",146
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,14,Good luck in your endeavors!,5
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,15,"I'm a little late to this convo but I own a small shop with a handful of guys.

Currently we only have a Snap On truck which I buy off of but the guy who is changing oil and rotating tires has no need for $300 impact sockets.",68
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,16,Look up techs choice/ koons Trucking on youtube,8
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,17,We have a independent guy. He’s geared more toward body shop work than automotive but he’s been around forever one of my coworkers has been buyin tools from him for like 20 years lol he also sells stuff for the same price as they are on Amazon (gear wrench and sunnex and whatnot) not sure how maybe he has commercial account and gets things cheaper. But he also doesn’t have a set territory like other tool trucks so he can go where ever he wants!,85
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,18,I don’t even know where to begin. This has been on my mind lately too.,15
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,19,"Way late seeing this thread but I will say I have an independent dealer that came from one of the big brands and absolutely solid guy, carries most of the brands you listed and a few more and is always reliable and has good prices.

Obviously I’ll warranty stuff I sell, but if someone has a product I sell and they didn’t buy it from me, I’m not sure if I should still cover it? I’m guessing it’ll be depending on the customer and the relationship.",69
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,26,"No probably won’t deal much in boxes, except maybe used. Again a bit harder when I have to carry the note on everything.",23
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,27,Thanks! That’s actually why I started thinking of going independent. Lol,11
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,28,So you’d give an independent a try? You think there’s a market and a place for them?,17
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,29,Yeah looking at wholesalers it’s going to take a lot of shopping around to be competitive. Amazon is tough to beat. And in many cases I probably just won’t be able to.,32
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,30,Oh really? Looking around it seems like a pretty plausible enterprise to me. I’m nervous for mostly previously mentioned reasons.,20
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,31,"On the snapon side here. My guys buy from me. They love the brand, but a large part of the loyalty is to who they buy from. I don't think you would make the same amount of money going independent as you would with the snapon brand at your back, but you would be free to do what you want as you want.",63

z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,34,"If I had an independent truck coming to my dealership I would spend way more than I’d like to admit. I personally buy tools of quality, price and convenience. I think an independent truck would provide the perfect mix of all 3. I think there is a good market for it.",51
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,35,You aren't going to be able to beat Amazon on price. You may be able to find some wholesalers to buy things 5% cheaper than Amazon but you won't be able to make a living selling cheaper than Amazon.,39
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,36,"You will be selling service, convenience and easy payments.",9
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,37,For sure. I think whatever the truck it should have as much as possible loaded in it and some of the oddities or new stuff you haven’t seen.,28
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,38,"And that’s kind of what I was thinking. I’m a bit afraid that it’s not as exclusive as a brand like snap-on. You can buy most of this off Amazon, and in many cases just a bit cheaper. I’m hoping having it in stock, financing, good service and warranty is enough to convince someone to buy from me, rather than shop the truck and go home and purchase from Jeff bezos.",71
z9e1zg,ToolTruckTools,39,"Personally, I prefer to keep my money local as much as possible and try not to support the huge guys like amazon, etc. The older I get, I see the importance of supporting the independents. I'll pay more (within reason) and give up some convenience to do business with people that I like.",53

Right now, you are overspending a lot in various parts of the build and unfortunately have purchased the mobo already. As for performance and cost, I’d recommend a 360mm aio for better looks and airflow although the tower cooler should be ok without heavy overclocking. Motherboard would’ve been better as z690 + ddr4 since z790 is expensive and not really useful for the cost unless you use ddr5 (z690 is cheaper and has boards supporting ddr5 too). As for the ram, try to get the lowest cost of ram that’s 3200mhz cl16 or 3600mhz cl18. For the case, 5000D is ok but overpriced imo.

So with that, and that I'm not buying any new storage or OS, I feel okay with spending a bit on other parts.",98
unknown,unknown,2,I've heard that AIOs can be overkill and less reliable than fan cooling. Do you have a AIO you'd recommend? And do you have a particular wattage you think I should get for a PSU?,35
unknown,unknown,3,Ah I see. For aio I’d recommend Arctic freezer ii as it has quiet operation and great cooling performance (also has a vrm fan on the pump). For wattage I think 1200w would be safer (I roughly estimated by 750w times 1.5 and added 100w since you have 3080 ti which can have voltage spikes). But 1000w and even 850w would probably work without problems (could limit oc potential).,69

z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,0,Are Entrepreneurs competitive?,3
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,1,"Currently planning my transition from sales to opening a small business, likely going to be a sole proprietor. I’m reading a lot of books on entrepreneurs which involves studying the traits of the best ones. I noticed they constantly say how passionate and persuasive and purpose driven they all are which describes me great (I think everyone is to a degree so I know I’m not special)",67
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,2,"However, as a salesman, one trait that drives me and has stood out to me is my competitiveness. It has led me to a lot of my success as I desperately want to feel superior to my colleagues who I really don’t feel any respect for. Back when we worked in office, I was quite ruthless and would bully, manipulate, and mislead my colleagues to make them perform worse so I could beat them on the leaderboards.",77
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,3,Some of the most gratifying experiences in my sales career was being number one and completely beating some kid in numbers who would always bully me back and would try humiliating me whenever he saw I was lower energy/burnt out as well. I loved seeing him feel envious of me and my peers saying things like “I have no clue how you do it”,64
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,4,I’m curious though if this level of competitiveness will help me as I become a business owner? I’ve seen stories of business owners who act similar but haven’t read much on it. Would appreciate some insight. Thank you,38
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,5,"It is a healthy trait to feel competitive but your view of it is all wrong in my opinion. You do not want to see yourself as ""superior"" to your employees, you want to set an example for them. A superiority complex will get you into trouble down the road and cause issues you don't need. It's the biggest difference when transitioning from an employee to a business owner, you no longer have to prove yourself amongst your peers but the goal is to show you care and are in the trenches with them. Never run a business with an ego, employees should be seen as equals. This has always been my philosophy and it has worked out very well for me.",122

z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,22,"True even doing studying/reading I see how privileged I am as an employee, sure I work hard and am responsible but can get away with a lot whereas it seems running the company is all about 100% responsibility and having that ideal personality. How is healthy competition shown as an entrepreneur?",51
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,23,well i’m a woman so probably…,6
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,24,"I can tell you that as a business owner myself, I have to deal with all aspects of my business rather than my dedicated role when I used to be employed. But that doesn't mean there isn't room for healthy competition, perhaps this is something you can create within a sales team of your business? Not sure if this is something that you can do immediately however depending on what type of business you are looking to get started; it may be some time until you can hire of course.",90
z9ey4v,Entrepreneur,25,"Yeah you’re right, I’m thinking it’ll be a few years till then for sure but would be fun to do with the sale team when it does happen. You think it’s healthy though to look at social media and be motivated to do better than my peers from college / high school cause I feel like I’m better than them?",60
z9f0q7,AskDocs,0,Head Pain due to previous Cellulitis,6
z9f0q7,AskDocs,1,"I(F27) had severe cellulitis on the left side of the back of my head. I had three cuts. One below my ear, around toward the center, and one higher on my head. This was about 6 years ago. It was so infected, they couldn't sitch it together and instead gave me antibiotics. It was yellow and green colored wounds. I took them. Weeks later I had a checkup and they looked at my head and said it was fine. But years later since, I've been experiencing pain at the back left of my head, and the front left of my head. It will happen randomly. I'd say three times a year, but when it does, it last for around 3 weeks on end. I've been to the doctor since. All they do is give me pain medication. It does work, along with advil. But every couple of hours, I have to take more. Could this be a larger issue? Could this previous injury affect my cogitative function?",167

z9f2j6,problemgambling,1,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here. I’m not a gambler but my brother in law is. He started gambling in 2018 when he moved to Australia. He lost a ton of money and he vowed he will stop. He didn’t gamble for 3 years, during which he had a baby. Everything was going great until he relapsed around 6 months ago, and he lost around $12K. He promised he’d stop. But he relapsed again a couple days ago. Our family is tensed and really worried. I’d love it if you guys could give any suggestions on how we can help him with this addiction.",106
z9f2j6,problemgambling,2,"Gamblers anonymous for your brother in law. If anyone in your family feels affected, gam-Anon is a good resource",19
z9f2j6,problemgambling,3,Gambling addicts having access to large amounts of money can bring a lot of problems.,15
z9f2j6,problemgambling,4,Maybe discuss someone he trusts looking after his money for accountability.,11
z9f2j6,problemgambling,5,You can’t help him… he needs to help himself. This is the honest truth.,14
z9f2j6,problemgambling,6,yep.,1
z9f2j6,problemgambling,7,the people in Gam Anon will be well-equipped to help you deal with this traumatic situation.,16
z9f2j6,problemgambling,8,Thank you for the advice. I’ll look into this.,9
z9f2j6,problemgambling,9,"Currently his wife holds access to all the finances. But anytime he gets access, its like he’s a different person and a demon gets hold of him, and he starts gambling. The relapse I mentioned took place when his wife forgot they had an existing credit card. So I feel like this wouldn’t be a sustainable solution.",57
z9f2j6,problemgambling,10,Hmm that’s absolutely true but I’m hoping there’s a way to help him help himself?,15
z9f2j6,problemgambling,11,You can’t help him help himself. It his decision alone and he has to figure it out if he wants to. I get really annoyed at some of the “advice” found here that basically says someone needs to “control” the gambler. That will never work and instead brings other people down with him/her. I also highly disagree that gambling is a disease. What I’ve found is that it is a very addictive activity that is likely covering for something else in your life. Anyone who wants to quit can find resources and help and doesn’t need your help finding it.,100

z9f6sf,AskDocs,4,I didn’t think to ask at the time since I had tons of other things to do that day. But why would he say no caffeine?? I can’t find anything on google that would answer my q’s and have found no supporting evidence for caffeine consumption related to vision.,49

z9fh5j,Anxiety,0,"The worst kind of anxiety is unprompted anxiety, what do you guys think?",13
z9fh5j,Anxiety,1,"I’m minding my own business, just trying to sleep and— oh! I’m anxious! No reason for it, I’m just chilling but now I have a looming sense of foreboding. Thank goodness I have a medicine I can take when that or a panic attack happens, but it’s just the worst. I know anxiety is never fun, but part of me just wants to have a reason to be anxious, not just randomly ruin-my-night anxious… just makes me want to cry.",80
z9fh5j,Anxiety,2,"I used to worry about why there's no reason for me to have been worrying. There couldn't simply be no reason for it, so I'd mull and mull until I'd invented or gone seeking a reason.",36
z9fh5j,Anxiety,3,"Anxiety can often be irrational, and it's ok to feel it. Most the time, we can choose whether or not we act on our feelings. It's when you can't help yourself, or those feelings dominate your mind, that it's time to see the doctor.",44
z9fh5j,Anxiety,4,I get it. This is what happens to me.,9
z9fh5j,Anxiety,5,"I am trying CBT to see if that can help, but they always start by saying to focus on what you are anxious about... nothing! I have nothing. I would love to have a reason that I could focus on, work through and deal with.",45
z9fh5j,Anxiety,6,I have kept a log/tracking list for when i get anxious and what happened around it and I cannot find a pattern or flow.,24
z9fh5j,Anxiety,7,"I do have chronic pain that sets off my anxiety, but that is only about 50-60% of my anxiety filled times. I don't know why the other circumstances occur.",29
z9fh5j,Anxiety,8,It's a very very helpless feeling.,6
z9fh5j,Anxiety,9,"Yes, I agree completely. Sudden panic attacks when I’m working, reading a book, or watching a show etc are never fun. With nothing triggering it, I could be having an amazing day and then BOOM, I feel like I’m dying for a good 30 minutes-hour. Or when I’m doing something normal and I’m suddenly feeling tingly and lightheaded, and have to sit down with my head between my knees so I don’t pass out. I’ve been told by a doctor in the ER that I have Vasovagal, but I don’t need to feel stressed. I hate that these pop up. Lexapro has been a godsend for me tho.",108
z9fh5j,Anxiety,10,"Almost every day when I wake up I'm hit with a wave of anxiety and panic. I've started to just tell myself to not think or make any emotional decisions until at least a half hour after I wake up because usually by that time, I'm back to normal.",49
z9fh5j,Anxiety,11,"It really does suck though, I wish I didn't have to start every day that way, but I can't really do anything about it. I hope you feel better soon, wishing you the best <3",35
z9fh5j,Anxiety,12,"I am suffering from this now, and it is becoming a common occurrence late at nights. trying to find a solution or wait to cope",25
z9fh5j,Anxiety,13,"I dont have medication for this, does that help you? Do you need to take it regularly? Does it take a awhile to adjust to?",25
z9fh5j,Anxiety,14,"I'm in my 40's and have had issues with panic attacks, anxiety and depression since I was 20. At least that's when it broke out. Looking back there were a lot of signs that something isn't right in my youth and childhood.",42
z9fh5j,Anxiety,15,"I haven't had a panic attack in many years, I still tend to worry too much and look out for potential dangers that could be too stressful to me.",29
z9fh5j,Anxiety,16,"But I have made a lot of progress over the years. Since it was such a gradual progress, it sometimes feels like I haven't learned anything.",26
z9fh5j,Anxiety,17,"I have to remind myself that I did, by remembering how it used to be and how much everyday tasks, like buying groceries were a huge problem back then.",29
z9fh5j,Anxiety,18,One of the things I learned was that my anxiety can be triggered by my thoughts but also how I feel physically.,22
z9fh5j,Anxiety,19,"Due to my anxiety disorder I learned to ""scan"" my body in stressful situations.",14
z9fh5j,Anxiety,20,"""There's too many people in this room, the air is so thick in here, I can't breathe properly.""",18
z9fh5j,Anxiety,21,I don't like warm/hot weather for example. I think I struggle more mentally in these days.,16
z9fh5j,Anxiety,22,"The physical symptoms of sweating, raised heartbeat, more focus on the breathing, because of the heat, are the same symptoms that appeared when I had a panic attack.",28
z9fh5j,Anxiety,23,"Another example is a bad night sleep, when I wake up and feel all mushy and not really fit and awake.",21
z9fh5j,Anxiety,24,That feeling of not being in the presence and feeling disconnected from reality is something I know from my panic attacks.,21
z9fh5j,Anxiety,25,"You can look for the triggers, because as far as I can tell, from my experience, I could always find a trigger. It never came out of nowhere, at least in my case.",33
z9fh5j,Anxiety,26,"Idk, for me the worst is migraine anxiety coupled with I-just-had-an-argument-with-my-partner anxiety. Thankfully I have a kind partner whose reassurances keep me from going off the deep end.",28
z9fh5j,Anxiety,27,"I am in a similar boat, but without a probable cause like your chronic pain.",15
z9fh5j,Anxiety,28,Maybe because final (college) week is approaching? My grades are fine though. 😞,13
z9fh5j,Anxiety,29,"So I’m on a medication that helps with daily “normal” anxiety, like normally in my day I would feel a constant sense of foreboding. But occasionally I will get an actual panic attack that my normal medicine can’t handle, like this one. Usually it’s triggered by something like watching something scary, but sometimes it feels like there’s no cause like this time. When that happens I take an as needed pill that in around 30 min calms me down. I don’t use that one often, it’s kind of for emergencies I guess because otherwise I’d probably want to go to the ER lol",103
z9fh5j,Anxiety,30,"That’s true, I will admit prior to it actually getting bad I had noticed that I felt off for around an hour or two. I should have probably taken my medicine then in order to prevent it, but for some reason I’m really bad about taking preventative measures. I’m always like “maybe it will go away” or “maybe it won’t get too bad” when in reality I should take it as soon as I start feeling it coming on so that it doesn’t get bad in the first place",89
z9fh5j,Anxiety,31,Finals could be factoring in a little bit subconsciously maybe?,10
z9fh5j,Anxiety,32,"I am trying to learn to not find a cause for it. I almost feel like I am trying to invalidate the anxiety by finding some hidden root cause, which can make me more anxious when I can't find one. I am trying to learn to cope, without searching for a reason or cause (which is not easy).",58
z9fh5j,Anxiety,33,Had that happen once 😩,5
z9fh5j,Anxiety,34,You can ask yourself what made you feel off?,9
z9fh5j,Anxiety,35,I am on medication and if I don't take it I will feel the effects of the medication wearing off and that's not pleasant.,24
z9fh5j,Anxiety,36,Idk if that's what you mean.,6
z9fh5j,Anxiety,37,"Anyway, that would be a trigger in it's own way. I would look for the trigger that got you there and work on how to deal with it.",28
z9fh5j,Anxiety,38,By dealing with it I mean not getting lost in a downward spiral of rumination.,15
z9fh5j,Anxiety,39,"Try to catch the thoughts that drag you down, make you feel anxious, etc. and put them to scrutiny.",19
z9fh5j,Anxiety,40,"If you think ""You are not strong enough to do this, it's all in vain, just don't do it"",",19
z9fh5j,Anxiety,41,you can argue that you at least want to try it.,11
z9fh5j,Anxiety,42,"If it doesn't go as expected, you can at least be proud to have been courageous and strong enough to overcome your fears and give it a shot.",28
z9fh5j,Anxiety,43,"That's just one example, you can look for the thoughts in your head that probably just want to protect you from harm, had their time and place in your childhood, but haven't grown like you did.",36
z9fh5j,Anxiety,44,They still want to protect the little boy/girl that expresses itself in the emotions you feel.,16
z9fh5j,Anxiety,45,"It can be a rabbit hole, but ask yourself the next time you are anxious what root lies beyond that specific fear?",22
z9fh5j,Anxiety,46,Fear of loneliness? Fear of failure? Fear of lack of support?,11
z9fh5j,Anxiety,47,I know that I have a fear of failure. I associate failure with emotional pain.,15
z9fh5j,Anxiety,48,"Worthless, lazy, inadequate etc.",4
z9fh5j,Anxiety,49,"I have to teach the part of me, that has this automatic response of thoughts to failure, that failure means much more than just these negative traits.",27
z9fh5j,Anxiety,50,"It also means learning, growing, experience etc.",7
z9fh5j,Anxiety,51,"We have these patterns of behaviour, moral values, the do's and don'ts we have learned from our parents, teachers, friends, society from an early age.",25
z9fh5j,Anxiety,52,"How strong you have to be to be a worthy human, how you have to behave in certain situations, etc.",20
z9fh5j,Anxiety,53,"And I think these things can collide with the needs of that child in us, that is expressed through our emotions.",21
z9fh5j,Anxiety,54,That child is sometimes to weak to meet these demands and then we suffer emotionally.,15
z9fh5j,Anxiety,55,"My way to bring these to together, the ""parental values"" and the needs of the child is to be the rational adult. The referee, talkmaster, whatever to bring these parts together.",31
z9fh5j,Anxiety,56,"They both have their arguments. ""You should do this and that. You have to be like this"" and the ""I can't to this. It's too much.""",26
z9fh5j,Anxiety,57,The role of the adult me is to hear their arguments and find a middleground.,15
z9fh5j,Anxiety,58,"If I have an appointment I am scared of and my emotional (child) response would be to hide and don't do it, the other part says ""but you have to do it (or you are a failure)"", I give the alternative to try it.",44
z9fh5j,Anxiety,59,"To give the emotional side breathing room to fail, and the expecting and demanding side to at least try it.",20
z9fh5j,Anxiety,60,"It's a mess in a way, but it is what it is.",12
z9fh5j,Anxiety,61,I hope you were able to find something in the things I have said for you.,16
z9fh5j,Anxiety,62,"Oh yeah, it’s really hard just living with it. Because if I start to try to think of a reason, my mind will just fill with intrusive thoughts that freak me out and make it worse",36

z9fz47,pharmacy,0,How do i deal with this pharmacy?,7
z9fz47,pharmacy,1,"Im a pharmacist at an independent in a small city. Right down the road from my pharmacy, a couple of the chains closed due to short staffing. We are getting an influx of patients transferring in from them which is obviously great for business but theres just one problem...",49
z9fz47,pharmacy,2,"They're still billing fucking prescriptions over there. So i call them up, wait on hold for more than 2 hours, and am eventually told that the pharmacy is closed due to staffing so they have no ability to reverse claims. They tell me to call a different store and do a central lookup/reversal. Fine. I call a different and still nearby store, wait on hold another 45 minutes, and ask them to reverse these claims for me. They tell me they cant do the central search or whatever and that i HAVE to call that specific store to have it done. So i tried calling the original store again and was told for an hour and a half that the pharmacy staff were ""on lunch"". I called back one final time and was told that the pharmacy is closed, try again tomorrow..",142
z9fz47,pharmacy,3,Patients that go over there are apparently being told the pharmacy is closed and turned away. I called Medicaid to ask about override possibilities and was told the dr would have to submit a PA for early refill with attached paperwork indicating that the pharmacy that originally billed the RXs was closed. In some of these cases by the time all of that actually gets done and submitted correctly the medication will almost be billable again anyway.,77
z9fz47,pharmacy,4,Where do i go from here? is this not reaching the point of insurance fraud? Does anyone know any chains in your area that operate like this?,27
z9fz47,pharmacy,5,sounds like Walgreens.,3
z9fz47,pharmacy,6,"the good news is, if it is in fact a Walgreens, the prescriber might be able to help you. When they send an eRx WAG software automatically bills insurance 99% of the time (bad for those of us trying to take care of Walgreens refugees. But likewise, when the prescriber sends Walgreens an electronic cancelation of the same script Walgreens software automatically reverses the paid claim 99% of the time. So save yourself some hold time and ask the prescriber to cancel the Walgreens Rx electronically. A lot of my local docs have gotten used to this request and start by cancelling the Walgreens eRX before they even send us the reordered eRX.",113
z9fz47,pharmacy,7,"Ran into this on Turkey Day with a Walmart. Of course, I’ve also had to break it down for a couple of walk-in clinic NPs that 1) I can’t access another store’s voicemail to get the script you left after closing. 2) I can’t see the e-script you sent after they closed either. It was like teaching a dog algebra.",60
z9fz47,pharmacy,8,"If you continue to have these issues, contact your state BoP and initiate a complaint. Situations like this definitely effect a patient's ability to receive their meds in a timely manner. This problem also hinders you ability to tend to your current patient's needs.",44
z9fz47,pharmacy,9,"We leave it up to the patient. ""Walgreens has a paid claim. have them reverse it."" If they can't get it done, offer to cash it out with the understanding that we may be able to rebill it when Walgreens reverses the claim but no promises. Not the greatest service, but if you act like it's the patient's responsibility from the start, they usually accept that.",66
z9fz47,pharmacy,10,"This is happening to us with 2 different CVS’s close by. They’re closed 1/3 to 1/2 of the time and peoples rx’s are still getting billed due to their auto data entry. I’ve filed complaints with the BOP and am instructing every single patient that transfers to us to do the same. If there’s no one in the pharmacy, auto data entry should be disabled.",65
z9fz47,pharmacy,11,"Report them for Medicare fraud. Fax a transfer request, and 24 hours later file a state board complaint for failure to comply with request to transfer.",26
z9fz47,pharmacy,12,Do BOTH of those for every single RX that has this happen. I promise it will get fixed within 1 week.,21
z9fz47,pharmacy,13,"I have a similar situation, but I'm not nearly as patient as you are to wait on hold for an hour. But in my area if we can't get ahold of anybody we just leave a voice-mail with all the information for transfer/reversal. This depends on your state laws if you can do this for a transfer, but if you are waiting on a reversal and have other stuff to do just leave a voice-mail the pharmacist should eventually get it and do it themself.",85
z9fz47,pharmacy,14,"Those stores are probably over 4 days behind on scripts,so they are just doing scripts for whoever walks in their store and ignoring the phones as much as they can.",30
z9fz47,pharmacy,15,Have your patients initiate a complaint to the state board. Do NOT submit the claim yourself.,16
z9fz47,pharmacy,16,"Have the patient call and get it reversed. They don't have any other customers to help, you do. Sure the situation sucks but have the patient and their doctor work it out, they are the ones who sent it to the closed store in the first place.",47
z9fz47,pharmacy,17,Contact the state medicaid fraud unit.,6
z9fz47,pharmacy,18,"When you're calling for these copies, just make sure or tell the pharmacist to return or reverse the billing claim. If you got a new script from the doctors office and the pharmacy has it billed, just tell the patient they have to call and have the pharmacy reverse their claim or they'll have to pay cash price. I've been on hold with Walgreens and CVS for 30+ minutes before being able to speak to anyone and we can't do that and do our other jobs.",86
z9fz47,pharmacy,19,Contact your state board.,4
z9fz47,pharmacy,20,Their corporate structure is potentially harming patients (in addition to giving you unnecessary stress/wasted time).,15
z9fz47,pharmacy,21,"Beyond how to get the prescription billed and filled for the patient, you should let the BoP know about this situation. I believe OK had to have walgreens attend a BoP meeting over the summer to address concerns about unscheduled closures of stores and the negative impact on patients (delay of care, closing pharmacies in a rural area, etc).",59
z9fz47,pharmacy,22,You report them to your licensing body and tell the patients why they have to pay cash and give them the info to report to their insurance and the pharmacies licensing body.,32
z9fz47,pharmacy,23,I would call your state board of pharmacy. Sounds illegal to charge insurance for a prescription you never sell.,19
z9fz47,pharmacy,24,"That does seem like fraud. Bill and not fill. Bill and fill and not dispense, and then perhaps never reversing. Auditable by a PBM as well.",26
z9fz47,pharmacy,25,Bill out of pocket for all generics. Keep your price cost +12$. Save yourself time and effort. Brand names dont worry about filling them.,24
z9fz47,pharmacy,26,This is also a Walgreens thing…,6
z9fz47,pharmacy,27,"If, say, pt’s ins was billed at Wag A, then Wag A closes on the day that pt needs the med. Pt can go to Wag B and get their med by paying out of pocket completely.",37
z9fz47,pharmacy,28,"Then when Wag A opens, either pt or Wag B (preferably the pt ofc) calls Wag A to reverse claim. Pt then goes to Wag B, ask them to rebill their ins, and get a refund on the oop cost (which can be done if claim reversal and rebill happen within 7 days)",53
z9fz47,pharmacy,29,"If it’s part D, call the fraud and waste hotline for whatever insurance it is. Tell them you are trying to fill scripts for their clients but Walgreens has billed these claims without filling them which is fraud. You could get a 10% whistle blower payment for whatever fines they may levy agains Wags.",54
z9fz47,pharmacy,30,Can you answer a question for me in inbox,9
z9fz47,pharmacy,31,"I have two stores in my chain that closed down where this was happening. Unfortunately a lot of scripts were “lost” for a day as they transitioned from one store to another, but for the most part they transferred through central search just fine. But the store where all the prescriptions are going was absolutely overwhelmed, as I’m assuming the store you called also was, and obviously only the pharmacist and a couple techs were experienced enough to have good standard answers about this. A store closing or weird internal transfer issues are not something that happen all the time. The stores that closed really didn’t have the ability to field transfer calls—they were busy taking inventory and packing/shipping out all the drugs to my own store (which was chaos).",130
z9fz47,pharmacy,32,"I’m pretty sure, if only they had the time, the store you called could put in a ticket with their third party help desk. But they are probably dealing with 100 similar issues.",33
z9fz47,pharmacy,33,Email the state board and tell them the situation. Paper train. Lets close down those pharmacies for good.,18
z9fz47,pharmacy,34,"That sucks, OP.",3
z9fz47,pharmacy,35,"I would just find a discount on all their meds, and tell them that you can rebill it with the insurance within 7 days if they can get it settled at the other pharmacy.",34
z9fz47,pharmacy,36,You can’t waste that much of your time on that BS.,11
z9fz47,pharmacy,37,Bring the list of orders to that Chain’s district manager biweekly and have them reverse those claims overnight,18

z9fz47,pharmacy,44,> 24 hours later file a state board complaint for failure to comply with request to transfer.,17
z9fz47,pharmacy,45,Not all states make it mandatory to transfer prescriptions. It is considered a courtesy. If the patient wants their meds at a new pharmacy have the MD cancel the original rx and send a new one to the new pharmacy.,40
z9fz47,pharmacy,46,I have just taken to faxing a reversal request.,9

z9fz47,pharmacy,48,"If it's not a control drug just pull the Wag A rx to wag B, then store it at Wag B. This will reverse the billing. You can't pull controls so if it's control you're still SOL",37
z9fz47,pharmacy,49,Why wouldn’t you just transfer the drug and auto reverse the claim? That’s the entire point of the system at Walgreens.,21
z9fz47,pharmacy,50,Even if it’s not part D insurance plans want to know about these access to care issues. If there are many of them we can audit all lines and start taking back claims they can’t prove were picked up but it doesn’t do anything in the moment.

z9fz47,pharmacy,51,All it takes is data entry to get a paid claim and tie up the insurance. Will probably sit in a queue for 4-5 days before actually ready for dispensing at a retail pharmacy that is understaffed,37
z9fz47,pharmacy,52,"This is true for every retail pharmacy, though… You type the Rx and get a tentative claim through their insurance. The claim isn’t billed to the patient until they pick up the Rx, but still ties up any more claims for that drug. This prevents duplicate claims, and is a form of preventing insurance fraud.",55
z9fz47,pharmacy,53,"Rite Aid floater here - am pretty new - so far I've not seen an automatic reversal feature that works externally (we have an internal feature that lets us pull things from other Rite Aids without having to call them to back it out - this doesn't work with other pharmacies), but the doctor can cancel prescriptions and it will show up in the pharmacist exception queue as a cancel request that we have to approve or deny, requiring immediate action (even if we're behind, that is extremely hard to ignore as most of the time there are only up to 5 things in that queue). At the very least, if the pharmacy is open it won't be ignored for very long, and only requires their fingerprint to cancel the prescription.",131
z9fz47,pharmacy,54,"Yes they do, but if the prescriptions are in transition from one store to another, it may not work properly. I believe the prescriptions have to go through some system transition where they change from central to local at another store. The scripts should not be “stuck” as billed at the closed store for forever or even for more than the first couple days of the transition though. If the matter is about a maintenance medication, I would suggest waiting a few days for the dust to settle and then seeing if the pharmacist at that store can find the RX at that point. That store is probably also understaffed and now suddenly has to field 100 extra calls about transfers. You can try a less busy store and see if that works. Or even just having the patient fill it one time at that pharmacy that received their prescription.",150
z9fz47,pharmacy,55,"No there is no auto reversal feature. When a Dr sends a cancel request it has to be manually acknowledged by the pharmacist on duty before it is reversed out of the system. If it is ready to be picked up at a Rite Aid, another one could pull it from their system and put it on hold at their new location. At that point an outside pharmacy could possibly bill for it no problem. But if something is ""in process"" at the original Rite Aid, meaning they billed the claim but maybe it is in Ready to Fill or needs the final pharmacist verification or something, even another Rite Aid can't pull it without contacting the first one to have them cancel it back. I've had this happen many times and it's a bitch to have to try calling the original store to tell them to back shit out before they fill it so we can.",157

z9fz47,pharmacy,57,What state doesn’t require a pharmacy to transfer an RX at the request of the patient or patient’s agent?,19
z9fz47,pharmacy,58,For Walgreens - just find an open store and if patient needs the Rx quickly - call and explain the circumstances. Have them pull the script over to that store and to put it on hold (as long as it’s not controlled or have a complicated billing). If the patient doesn’t need it immediately- fax over the transfer request and put a note on it.,65

z9fz47,pharmacy,61,not every retail pharmacy has automatic data entry before someone looks at it,13

z9gfyg,asktransgender,0,ELI5: WTF is progesterone for?,5
z9gfyg,asktransgender,1,"I’m 14 months on E and spiro and I still don’t understand when you take progesterone, why, and how it’s different. All I see are debates and confusion about boob growth or horniness and I’m totally lost.",37
z9gfyg,asktransgender,2,"The effects of progesterone vary, both physical and mental. Physical, it affects fat distribution, though the kinds and levels of effect vary, but many do like what it does. It does indeed affect libido for some. For some, it gives them more energy (but also sometimes needing more sleep). Mentally, the effects are all over the place, with some reacting very well to it and it being the best thing since sliced bread and others absolutely hating it, and everywhere in between. For me, it is an extremely strong anti-dissociative (mostly a good thing) and the physical affects have been rather mild but still nice subtle changes.",107
z9gfyg,asktransgender,3,"The short answer is that medical science doesn't know exactly what, if anything, it does for transfemme people. There are anecdotal reports that it helps with/helps complete breast development, that it helps with feminine fat distribution, that it increases libido that's been lost as a result of E and antiandrogens, that it can have positive mental health effects, positive effects on sleep, and a variety of other effects that people list, but that's all anecdotal. It's really up to you whether you think that anecdotal evidence is sufficient to be worth trying it. Personally I tried it, had bad side effects, and stopped; my sister tried it, saw very positive mental health effects and no side effects, and has stayed on it.",122
z9gfyg,asktransgender,4,"Best I can tell, we have no freaking clue. Some say it helped feminization, some say it hurt, some say it did nothing. Some say it should be started after a year, some at tanner 3, some never. It definitely shows up in cis girls puberty, but science isn't exactly sure WHY. With so much anecdotal evidence, and a near complete lack of scientific basis (even among the extremely undeveloped field of trans science), its up to you if you wanna talk to your doc about it. I'm still new to HRT (only 5 mos) so I of course have no first hand experience with it myself.",107
z9gfyg,asktransgender,5,"I’ve been on it for maybe a year? My boobs are rounder, sure, I sleep easier at night, my sex drive came back after a year on spironolactone… but I can’t really say with absolute certainty that any of that wouldn’t have happened as a result of spiro and e alone. That’s the real challenge - isolating just the effects of progesterone. ::",63
z9gfyg,asktransgender,6,"The small-ish community, years of stigmatization of trans issues and lack of money that can be extracted from said small-ish community has left us mostly in the dark.

z9gfyg,asktransgender,7,"That's why these communities have formed, and what makes this whole thing so tough for a lot of people. If the medical scientists aren't going to figure it out, we have to make due.",34
z9gfyg,asktransgender,8,"The only thing we all know for sure, is that you can look up cis female hormone timelines all over the internet. Progesterone comes into the female body something like tanner3 to tanner4, as menstruation begins, increases over time until a steady state, and then spikes as women get pregnant. Some say that female breasts don't come into full maturity until pregnancy, where they generally swell in preparation for feeding babies.",71
z9gfyg,asktransgender,9,"I have this idealized, compressed cis-female schedule, where somewhere between recognizing tanner 3 and tanner 4 starts, introduce small amounts of cycling progesterone, and increase it slightly over time. And as I feel like I'm nearing the middle to end of tanner stage 4, try to convince my doc to POUND that the progesterone into me, to simulate a pregnancy, for a short while. Pregnancy is a dangerous time for a woman, and progesterone has it's own list of side effects, but I want to look outwardly like a woman so bad, I'm going to do this ""experiment"" as close as possible to what women go through!",107

z9hdxy,legaladvice,5,It turned out that A went to the lawyer and signed the quit claim deed before we could make any such document (he is kind of dick so we were trying to draft a document that wouldn't accidentally give him more power over us than he would have had as an equal home owner). We got distracted by my estranged dad passing away and the busyness of daily life and we ultimately never drafted that document.,76
z9hdxy,legaladvice,6,Now it's 5 years later and due to A's increasingly toxic behavior I threatened that if he didn't stop treating us like crap I would kick him out of the house. He countered that he would take me to court over the quit claim deed and force the sale of the house to make sure no one had the house.,60
z9hdxy,legaladvice,7,"I've been doing my research and I plan on talking to a lawyer but since the quit claim was signed, notarized, and filed with the register of deeds over 2 years ago and my mom's will and estate was also over 2 years ago I'm almost positive that he can't do that.",52
z9hdxy,legaladvice,8,"What I was really hoping you folks could fill me in on is: was the lawyer correct when he said that A had to be compensated for giving up his share of the house or was he just passing his opinion of how we ""needed to stick together"" off as something we legally had to do?",56
z9hdxy,legaladvice,9,Edit: The child support he owed was paid in the interim,11
z9hdxy,legaladvice,10,"I'm not a lawyer, but I think what is going on here is pretty ugly. You may have some liability here.",21
z9hdxy,legaladvice,11,> (A) came forward and said he couldn't have his name on the deed because he owed 40k in child support.,21
z9hdxy,legaladvice,12,"This sounds like ""A"" is trying to fraudulently hide assets to avoid paying child support (with your help).",18
z9hdxy,legaladvice,13,>the lawyer stressed that my other brother and I had to compensate A with something of equal value to his share of the house.,24
z9hdxy,legaladvice,14,"This sounds like the lawyer trying to cover his own butt by recommending that the three of you refrain from fraudulently hiding assets to help ""A"" avoid paying child support. But this really is not the lawyer's issue, since he represents the estate, not you, and the estate was settled by the house being deeded to the three of you.",60
z9hdxy,legaladvice,15,>was the lawyer correct when he said that A had to be compensated for giving up his share of the house,21
z9hdxy,legaladvice,16,He's correct in the sense that it's not a good idea for three of you to form a conspiracy to hide assets that should be going towards your brother's child support obligation.,32
z9hdxy,legaladvice,17,>he would take me to court over the quit claim deed and force the sale of the house to make sure no one had the house.,26
z9hdxy,legaladvice,18,He is full of crap on this (and apparently many things). He does not own the house.,17
z9hdxy,legaladvice,19,"But I think you are in legal jeopardy here. The value of A's share of the house should have gone to pay his child support obligation, but instead you got it. This needs to be fixed. If that means selling the house, so be it.",45
z9hdxy,legaladvice,20,You should see a lawyer to see how you can pay this money back without criminal charges. Do this proactively will be much better for you than if the state comes after you for it.,35
z9hdxy,legaladvice,21,Edited post to reflect that A paid the child support in the years since. (He used the money from his dad's estate to pay it),25
z9hdxy,legaladvice,22,I will bring that up with a lawyer when I talk to them though. Thank you for the advice.,19
z9hdxy,legaladvice,23,"That makes a huge difference, obviously. But what he (and you) did 5 years ago could still be a criminal act.",21
z9hdxy,legaladvice,24,"At this point you own the house. He does not. It's up to you as to what if anything you want to do about this. If he tries to go to court, he would have to argue that you promised (verbally) to help him commit fraud, and then failed to follow through on it. It's a bit like a drug dealer getting ripped off in a drug deal and then calling the police because someone stole their drugs.",78
z9hdxy,legaladvice,25,Talking to a lawyer is a very good idea.,9
z9hdxy,legaladvice,26,"Edit: just rereading the whole post, there is no legal ""obligation"" for you to compensate your brother for his share of the house. Apart from the whole child support thing, it's perfectly legal for your brother to receive a share of the house as an inheritance, and then deed it to you as a gift. The issue in court would be what if anything the two of you agreed on at the time.",73
z9hdxy,legaladvice,27,"Again, thank you very much. Due to the multifaceted nature of this issue I've been trying to figure out what kind of lawyer I need to talk to about this and this has narrowed it down considerably.",37
z9hjel,flightsim,0,Question for Vatsim controllers,4
z9hjel,flightsim,1,"So I have done at most 2 or 3 flights on Vat sim before, but it's been a long while and want to get started again, had a question for controllers. Lately, I've been doing practice flights in the F-16 OR F/A-and mainly just like to cruise around. From what I remember, a flight has to be to a different airport than the one you took off from, but do you think controllers would mind if I did some back and forth patterns in the process?",86
z9hjel,flightsim,2,"For example, a lot of my flights consist of me taking from Edwards AFB and flying around in the restricted airspace. If I took off from Edwards and did that then landed at say Area 51 do you think controllers would mind as long as I clearly stated my intentions. So it wouldn't be a direct flight and I could even provide a route to help to say I will be flying this specific pattern.",75
z9hjel,flightsim,3,"There is no requirement that a flight has to go from point A to B, as long as you have a coherent flight plan and follow ATC instructions/basic regulations. If you're in uncontrolled airspace, you can basically do anything within the code of conduct.",44
z9hjel,flightsim,4,"I'm not sure how the airspace is structured around KEDW, but you may or may not be in contact with LA center. You can always ask the controller, but be prepared to operate within whatever clearance they give you. You should also respect that they're probably busy, and VATSIM isn't really the place to request a high speed pass over LAX during a Friday night.",65
z9hjel,flightsim,5,Thanks. I wouldn't request anything that crazy. I usually dont fly supersonic out side the proper airspace and in this instance make sure to request any high speeds. Usually I fly around M.85-90 so only slightly faster than airliners.,39

z9hwri,cincinnati,2,"I’ve been looking at transportation options that late at night (and really early morning for the return trip). I tried contacting some taxi companies I found online via email to arrange pickup and drop off and got no answers (I assume they want to call me, and I don’t have a US number).",53
z9hwri,cincinnati,3,"I know there is a direct Tank route to downtown Cincinnati, but I’m actually going to Covington, and the airport express seems to not stop in Covington despite driving through it.",31
z9hwri,cincinnati,4,1) How likely am I to find a taxi waiting if I go to the taxi stand?,17
z9hwri,cincinnati,5,2) Are there any reliable taxi companies that can arrange a scheduled ride?,13
z9hwri,cincinnati,6,Might try Uber or Lyft there are usually plenty around airport,11
z9hwri,cincinnati,7,"I get Uber all the time, even at 4am. Never had an issue.",13
z9hwri,cincinnati,8,Frequent flyer here. You'll find a ride no problem with Lyft or Uber. You might have to wait 15-20 min but someone will come,24
z9hwri,cincinnati,9,I’ve used Moe’s taxi to get to the airport at 4am and never had an issue. I do think you need to call but you should be able to borrow a phone to set it up,36
z9hwri,cincinnati,10,Taxi service is very sketchy there and expensive. It’s a bunch of unmarked vans with a sticker saying they’re vetted. Said it’d be $75 to Oakley. Got a Lyft instead for $50.,32
z9hwri,cincinnati,11,"11pm isn’t that late flying into CVG, you won’t have any issues getting an Uber or Lyft at that time. I actually flew on a delayed flight into CVG and arrived at 2am and was still able to get an Uber from CVG to Covington, now granted it was probably $40, but it still wasn’t a big deal.",58
z9hwri,cincinnati,12,"I've gotten airport ubers at 5am before, my most recent time the guy told me it was already his 3rd airport trip that morning, so he had to have been going by before 4am",34
z9hwri,cincinnati,13,"So I just flew out early morning (left the house at 5:00am) and in late (arrived at 10:30) used Lyft both ways and it was completely painless. The only thing to know is where to meet your driver when arriving. After you walk out of baggage claim head to the right, keep walking to the end of the building (you will see signs that say bus transport) make another right and there is a parking lot straight in front you you that the driver will pick you up in.",89
z9hwri,cincinnati,14,You won’t have any issues. I travel for work and never had an issue anytime. Not even during covid,19
z9hwri,cincinnati,15,"For the 2X TANK route, if you purchase your ticket via the Transit App, it is valid for 2hours with unlimited rides. That would cover the transfer to a #1 or #8 (both routes have a few trips after 11:30pm). Probably not the fastest option (about 45 min trip time including the transfer), but definitely the most affordable at $1.50.",60

unknown,unknown,0,I wouldn’t rely on taxi service at 4am any more than a rideshare,13
unknown,unknown,1,I know it’s slightly different but my wife and I used Uber for our Disney trip when we left at 530. You can schedule an Uber to pick you up at whatever time,33
unknown,unknown,2,"Schedule it ahead. I've gotten Ubers at 4a in the middle of nowhere NC to go to work when my truck died, they're a little more expensive, but I've had better luck doing that than taxies.",36
unknown,unknown,3,I’ve scheduled Lyfts in advanced at that time and have had zero issues. Plenty of drivers working the early morning flight crowds and red eye arrivals.,26
unknown,unknown,4,"I would feel comfortable getting a rideshare from Covington to the airport at 4am, for sure.",16
unknown,unknown,5,"“Scheduling an Uber” isn’t actually scheduling, unfortunately. It just sets a request ahead of time to be sent out around 5-10 minutes before your desired ride time. Uber’s own website says not to rely on it, as it’s not a guaranteed ride. If no one is around to accept the request at that time, no one will come.",58
unknown,unknown,6,You can get an Uber in Covington 24/7. You are right by the downtown and there are always plenty of drivers there all day and night. The only thing you ever have to worry about is if you cut it too close and the driver cancels at the last second. You will still get another driver but they will be 10 minutes or so late.,65

z9igab,CAguns,0,CA Gun Laws and LEOs,5
z9igab,CAguns,1,Gun newb here. Does anyone know the history behind CA LEOs being afforded special privileges that regular Californians aren’t. Or can point me in a direction where I can read about it?,32
z9igab,CAguns,2,"Pretty sure the short answer is that they have a strong union that can heavily influence policy. The perceived importance of an endorsement from said union during election season gives them a decent amount of influence (this may be waning in recent years). And despite some of the current rhetoric, being soft on crime still hurts your polling.",58
z9igab,CAguns,3,So said union pushed for LE exemptions when the laws were being written.,13
z9igab,CAguns,4,Someone smarter/more knowledgeable on legal history will give you a better answer.,12
z9igab,CAguns,5,"If you want to know the history, look at the law that allows it and find that law's legislative history. It's available on Lexis or Westlaw, but if you're not a lawyer with a subscription to one of those services, pop down to your local law library and ask the librarian to help you. It's all there.",57
z9igab,CAguns,6,"modern california law is based on humiliation, not truth justice or reason.",12
z9igab,CAguns,7,A lot comes from them being issued guns not available to civilians as well as full capacity magazines. They often carry at least the issued handgun home. Some departments have their LEOs buy their own equipment so they get access to the full catalogue of guns.,46
z9igab,CAguns,8,"Same reason why LEOs must be 20.5 years old before starting an academy. Because if they were younger, they couldn't enter bars to enforce the law.",26
z9igab,CAguns,9,"They just have to comply with the law, and it was easier to just give them an exception paragraph when they were writing the law.",25
z9igab,CAguns,10,"I think a big part of it is ""obviously the dogs of the state get privileges"" and another part of it is, ""they're professionals, so they can handle it, and you're not"".",32
z9igab,CAguns,11,Cops always have special privileges lol! Ya I just found my dream Glock 45 going for hair under 2k and almost bought it before finding another one for $1500 both were new never fired. I knew that was the best price I’d find since I’ve been watching the market for a while.,52
z9igab,CAguns,12,On a side note if your interested in a 19x get the G45 (9mm/Gen5) it’s the same gun just better and black in color. Just like why staccatos are going for 5k all day long and people pay it! I do know that Most departments do limit to 1-2 guns a year and also require a chiefs/sergeants approval letter to purchase any off roster guns. Unless your a sergeant or higher up I don’t think they can get more then a couple new guns a year without it being a problem or causing red flags!,95
z9igab,CAguns,13,Gotcha. That seems consistent with the information I’ve gathered from using the searchbar on this sub.,16
z9igab,CAguns,14,"I’m browsing the CalGuns marketplace section as we speak and it blows my mind that there’s so many people flipping off-roster guns for 2-3x or more msrp. Insane. G19X, P320s and 365s…HK USPs, Sig Five-Seven, FN SCARs…..lmaoooo what the fuck",40

z9iosk,legaladvice,4,"Did you support your husband for the three years he was unemployed by working?

Probably good idea to go to divorce mediation if you want a no fault divorce.",62
z9iosk,legaladvice,5,"Not entirely . We were using profits from sale of our home for expenses but as that was being depleted, I also did have a job. I’m not looking to get anything but don’t want to give up half of what we have when he know that he has this job. We previously owned our house free and clear and made a little over $106,000 per year so I’m getting used to my living standards being much lower than they had been.",82
z9iosk,legaladvice,6,I simply wanted to know if I could retort about the possibility if he pushes things beyond reason.,18
z9iosk,legaladvice,7,"I suppose you now rent and that can be a lower standard of living than home ownership that you once had during a portion of your marriage. Will you need to move to a cheaper apt? Whereas on a salary of 250k he can much more easily get a house (or luxury apt )and build equity again. Doesn’t seem fair that you cant participate in this largesse. If you are older don’t rush to divorce or if you don’t like your job! Not sure if the split is mutual. He seems to have it easy, not working for years and then being able to secure a high salary job that is much higher than his previous salary. The much higher salary jump seems off to me. You are entitled to maintain your same standard of living as you had during the marriage - that’s where the spousal support comes in. Also if you have been married for 10 years you are entitled to 1/2 of his social security earned during your years of marriage if it’s higher than yours at retirement and if he passes before you, you get his full social security. That could come in handy in your later years if he earned more than you. Seems like to me if you wait until he actually secures his job and it looks like he’ll keep it you would be better off getting some spousal support. You must have good health care too. If he has a retirement plan from past employment during the marriage you would be entitled to share in that. VA is an equitable distribution state, so the Court would look at what is fair. That might be much more of the 10k left for you from the property division. Its not 50/50 like in a community property state. It’s best to get your own attorney.",310

z9j4ty,nzev,18,"Thanks, I’ve emailed EVs Enhanced (who look pretty legendary) hoping they can shed some light on the options. I’ll try contacting Gazley too to see if they have any suggestions on it. There must be some way.",37
z9j4ty,nzev,19,Ah interesting thanks for the clarification. I thought it was ZE0 from here,13
unknown,unknown,0,will assume it’s ZE1 instead (is 2020 model),8
unknown,unknown,1,"edit: from what I can glean, NZ maps aren’t possible in the default Nissan Connect unit and it’s recommended to use Android or iPhone Car Play Instead for maps.",29
unknown,unknown,2,If you've got carplay/android auto then use that. The car's built-in stuff is pretty garbage. Virtually none of the legacy auto manufacturers have figured out quality infotainment.,27
unknown,unknown,3,"If you're worried about range/charging issues on long trips, look at the ""A Better Route Planner"" app, it works under carplay/android auto and helps you plan charging stops etc.",29
unknown,unknown,4,"Thanks yeah I’ll probably do that. There’s just some Japan quirks such as the speed limit warning will suddenly jump to show a random Japan map and sometimes it says good morning in the afternoon (though the clock is correct). I was hoping it could have more of an NZ focus in NZ. I’ll check with the dealer too, if any NZ SD card is available for it and the in the meantime will use Car Play.",77
unknown,unknown,5,"I am 90% sure you can disable all those annoying prompts with the LeafSpy app. It needs a specific kind of dongle, and LeafSpy Pro (About $20 last I checked).",30
unknown,unknown,6,I turned off all the annoying warning beeps in mine.,10
unknown,unknown,7,"You may also have a ETC charge card reader, and since the card is not present it may say an error message in Japanese. Only way to fix that is to remove the reader from the car.",37
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,0,"Disappointing MET effects, am i doing something wrong?",8
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,1,"I snorted all in all 45mg of MET fumarate and got only mild effects. It smells putrid so i don't want to smoke it, snorting is already bad enough. What am I doing wrong? Why is it so weak? Could boofing work better? Or can I get rid of the smell somehow?",52
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,2,what are the effects u got? i always enjoyed snorted MET a lot,13
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,3,Is it freebase? Don't you need to make it into a salt to be able to snort it? As far as I know if it's free base you can only smoke it. I am skeptical boofing will work if snorting didn't. I don't know about the smell.,47
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,4,YOU GOTTA BOOF9999,3
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,5,"Snorting 4-ho-met doesn't make it stronger. None of the psilocin analogues work better intranasally. Take it in a capsule or roll it in toilet paper and take a larger dose if it's not strong enough for you instead of trying other roas. Oral bioavailability is not an issue with these substances. A good rule of thumb is that 1g of shrooms is 10mg of psilocin, so 45mg is not a super high dose when it comes to psilocin analogues. Especially considering that I've seen psilocin analogues at 90% purity and there could be even worse batches than that.",98
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,6,"I would say, it's possible your issue is purity of the product, but Idk what kind of tolerance you have. The issue is not bioavailability.",25
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,7,I also don't know what you mean by mild. What effects are you looking for? I don't get a strong visual experience until I get close to 70mg.,28
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,8,"I've never snorted it, but I've taken pretty high doses vaped/smoked, probably over 100mg. No matter how hard I tried, it never got super deep.",25
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,9,MET is one of those psychedelics you just have to enjoy it for what it is. A zenny tactile euphoric but mild psychedelic.,23
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,10,Assume you're speaking of 4-ho-met. Why snort it? Oral is more effective.,12
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,11,"How reliable is your source and how positive are you that it was 45mg's? I can promise you that an accurately weighed 45mg dose of good metocin, even if snorted, would be one wild fucking ride. In fact, most people, including me, would think that 45mg's is way too much.",50
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,12,I did just 25mg's and was pretty surprised at how intense it was at times.,15
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,13,"Some mental relaxation, feeling calm, and bit sleepy. There was some bodyfeel, the bodyfeel was kinda is kinda nice and was the nicest part of it, but it was also moderate at best, and only for short. Almost no visuals apart from a bit brighter colours and very, very mild psychedelic overly over everything. When it comes to side effects, it just made me a bit jittery, but apart from that pretty much none, not even nausea. Can't forget about the smell tho, that was the biggest side effect",89
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,14,How is it for you? And how much do you snort?,11
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,15,"It's not freebase, i wouldn't snort freebase. It's fumarate. Or at least it was sold as such...",17
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,16,I am skeptical about boofing too.,6
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,17,"Idk either, but snorting it is as if a dead fish shit in your face",15
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,18,\#BOOFSQUAD HEAR HEAR,3
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,19,"Iam not talking about 4-HO-MET, that i only boof, works the best that way imo, saves a lot of material",20
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,20,"I am talking about MET, the unsubstituted variant, related to DMT. Orally you need a load of that, like 120-150mg according to psychonaut, if i remember correctly. That's why I want a way which requires less material",37
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,21,"I have no tolerance, i haven't done psychedelics in a while. It might be purity, but I am not sure anymore, considering someone else also reported to be this way nasally, and that it has to be smoked for stronger effects. But the smell is really fucking off-putting",48
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,22,"By mild i mean no visuals apart from brighter colours, headspace consisting only of inner-peace and very mild euphoria/mood lift and mild bodyfeel (warmness, mild numbness, a little bit of tingling, feeling comfy)",33
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,23,"Okay, that's kinda surprising. Good to know.",7
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,24,How intense does it get when vaped?,7
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,25,"Yeah, makes sense. I mean, it's good, just not what I expected. I still like it",16
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,26,"Nope, I mean MET, the unsubstituted DMT relative",8
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,27,"Also, with 4-HO-MET, i would recommend boofing, it's considerably more potent than oral",13
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,28,My source is pretty reliable and i weighted it myself with a pretty decent scale.,15
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,29,With metocin i would be in another universe with that dose lol,12
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,30,"at doses of 25-30 mg i get some nice mild visuals relaxation euphoria and mood boost i used these doses to go out in nature and just appreciate nature more i wasn’t really tripping, vaped the visuals get a lot stronger and it gets trippy i feel like snorted could be more recreational",53
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,31,"Maybe it's just bad quality then. Boofing should be stronger than snorting, and unless it hurt snorting it shouldn't hurt either when boofing. So maybe it's a better way but probably still not gonna be anything great.",37
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,32,"Ahh, sorry. Idk why I missed that. I can't help you with that.",13
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,33,Boofing is life.,3
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,34,But fumarate tryptamines provide relatively little added value when snorted or boofed. Boofing in excess can also cause some legg blood vein damage.,23
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,35,"I'm trying to tell you it never really gets intense, maybe if you IV it but fuck that.",18
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,36,I've put mine away for a while but next time I explore it I'll use in conjunction with psilocin or DMT.,21
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,37,"Me too, it's good, it just doesnt have the kick that some do",13
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,38,"Makes sense, i can see that. Maybe it's just different than i expected, as from what you're saying, the effects i got don't seem too far off. I just expected it more intense. I wasn't really tripping either, while I did expect a trip. And i mean, it was nice, don't get me wrong there",55
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,39,"How can you was it? The smell is awful already when I snort it, and if I had to vape it... Ew",22
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,40,"Also, how easy is it to vape, is it pain in the ass like DMT?",15
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,41,"That's also possible. Who knows. It hurts a little snorted, but compared to other shit it's fine. It shouldn't be a problem boofed. I'll try boofing some other time...",29
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,42,"I figured, i mean, if it's like this snorted, it's not likely to be that much better boofed, but still worth the try i guess. Even the effects from it are very meh",33
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,43,"No worries, happens",3
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,44,Indeed.,1
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,45,"It does, it lowers the dosage needed tremendously",8
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,46,"Okay, i must have misunderstood you",6
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,47,Fuck iv indeed,3
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,48,That combo sounds pretty good,5
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,49,Exactly,1
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,50,its not super difficult to vape actually i didn’t mind the taste while snorting and vaping its completely fine for me. I actually like the effects a lot of MET it grants me somewhat of an „inner-peace“ feeling,38
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,51,For sure. I am curious how it will turn out. Maybe MET is not a very good drug either. Its analogous compound 4-HO-MET is much more popular for some reason haha,31
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,52,"How do you vape it, with what method?",8
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,53,"You probably have a different, better batch. For me the smell is very much not okay, as I said, it smells like dead fish shit.",25
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,54,"Yeah, i like that too, it was probably the nicest part of it. In kinda similar fashion to DMT, but not nearly as strong.",24
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,55,"Looking bad, it was actually kinda good, just not as strong as i would expect",15
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,56,Kam curious too.,3
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,57,"I wouldn't say that it's bad, it feels good, it's nice, but it's so mild, it's not even a trip. But someone else said that they experience something similar to that, so maybe it is supposed to be that way when snorted.",42
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,58,"It should be lit more intense when vaped, but i can't imagine vaping that putrid smelling shit.",17
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,59,"Yeah, and i can see why, 4-HO-MET is great. One of my favorites psychedelics",14
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,60,i even vaped the fumarate salt just put it in a oil burner and hit it,16
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,61,"Okay, cool, I'll try that, thanks",6
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,62,just increase the dose too MET seems rather forgiving like it’s 4-HO brother does too,15
z9jbnl,researchchemicals,63,"I would increase the dose snorted, but i don't have much of it and don't want to use up half of it one one trip, so... Yeah. Glad to hear that it's so forgiving.",34

z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,45,"Thought you were a novice or something honestly from the piece of the pic shown above in the post, then I saw your lower body and other pics.. your calves are absolutely massive very impressive.. is it genetics, or do you have the best calve training routine in history? I’d love to know what you do for them, you seem to be lower body dominant so getting yoked will truly round you out imo",74
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,46,"Program looks solid bro, run it and keep us posted with your progress!",13
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,47,"Your legs are looking good, so is your arms and delts. Middle back is ok but your chest and lats are lacking. What grip do you do your pull ups with? It could also be a form issue for why you're not developing those areas more. Are you using full ROM and getting a nice stretch on the pull ups and chest exercises?",63
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,48,"Your frequency isn't really mentioned, so I'll say this. Arguably the two most important muscle groups for developing the ""yoked"" look are the shoulders and upper back. Shoulders are definitely emphasized in your program, but due to how quickly shoulders recover, one of the most important variables in training them is going to be frequency. Finding ways to increase delt frequency without compromising joint health can be key. For most guys, the upper back seems to be able to handle even more volume and frequency than even the shoulders, so (and again being mindful of joint health) it's super difficult to overtrain your upper back, and if we want it to grow maximally we should probably be training it with greater volume and frequency than most other bodyparts. I could give you some suggestions in this area from my own experience if you'd like.",144
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,49,"One thing I noticed looking at your pictures is that while your shoulders and arms do look pretty well developed already, your chest may be considered a weakpoint. The program you've written disproportionately focuses on upper chest and shoulders, but seems to neglect the greater portions of the chest which for most people are more receptive to growth. This shouldn't necessarily be a concern depending on the physique you're going for, but a big part of getting that thick, girthy look is developing a chest that projects away from your body, and this will be almost entirely lower and mid pec. Again, this is just goal specific so feel free to ignore",112
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,50,"Physique wise I'd say lats, rear delts, lower back, and neck could be better. Chest seems decent but you can never have too big of a chest imo.",28
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,51,+1,1
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,52,Noted.,1
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,53,"Either I'm shitty at working my upper body or my lower body has been more responsive, I've been working out a few years at this point.",26
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,54,"I don't know what to say about my calves, I guess being obese for all of my youth helped a ton :D Nowadays I mostly run and skip rope, but that can still give a good burn in the calves every now and then.",44
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,55,I vary the grips every now and then.,8
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,56,"Last 8 weeks were chin ups and wide grip pull ups, this cycle it's supinated pull ups and normal grip pull ups.",22
z9kw2k,naturalbodybuilding,57,"I don't record the pull ups that often, but I did it yesterday after seeing this. So my supinated form looks like this:",23
unknown,unknown,0,"I try to get full ROM on all exercises, like letting rows and pull ups reach the bottom and stretch and let the bar / dumbbells touch my chest when benching.",31
unknown,unknown,1,"It's a ULUL. So triceps, for instance, are getting hit 4 times per week.",14
unknown,unknown,2,The frequency is essentially 2x for most muscles except arms that is 4x.,13
unknown,unknown,3,"I am taking your points about frequency and work capacity for some muscles to heart though, I might reconsider what muscles I want / need to focus on.",28
unknown,unknown,4,Think I might just look into the RP Chest and Back specialization program or something similar now that all agree on those weakpoints!,23
unknown,unknown,5,Rom is looking good. But do a slightly narrower grip to target the lats more. The lats get better leverage when the upper arm is closer to the ribs.,29
unknown,unknown,6,"It's not an upper lower split, but there are also upper lower splits with A and B days which have different frequencies",22
unknown,unknown,7,"Yeah that sounds good,, you have quite a few pieces of the ""yoked"" physique covered already and you look good. I think you'll get there man, good luck on your journey!",31
unknown,unknown,8,"Cheers, I ended with this grip as a narrower grip gave me some elbow pain, but I think it was a bit about getting used to the exercise.",28
unknown,unknown,9,It's upper- or lower- weighted. You'll notice squats & deadliftss (lower day).,12
unknown,unknown,10,"But there's not big upper body compounds on this day, just bi-tri isolations.",13
unknown,unknown,11,The point is triceps get it 4 times per week frequency in this scenario.,14
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,0,Letter to her,3
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,1,"I won’t send this to you. I wish things were different but it is what it is. It’s been 6 weeks since we’ve spoken, 7 since the breakup, 8 since the argument.",32
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,2,"AV,",1
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,3,"I guess Saturday is the day. I guess I’ll see you for the first time in 6 weeks. I’m coming back to work. Class got cancelled today, and no in-person class tomorrow so I won’t be running into you during my return to school. I always wonder how you’re doing. Are you doing anything better? Different? Or are you just chillin at home on the Xbox I got you and turned into your only hobby? Is he still brainwashing you with sweet words?",83
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,4,"I went to Seattle two weeks ago. I’m going to LA in two weeks. We were supposed to go together in two weeks with the guys, remember? Things have been going well for me though, as much as it probably doesn’t seem like it since I’ve been so quiet. I’m 170lbs for the first time since I played college ball, lost 23lbs since the breakup. I remember you saying you liked the chunkier me, because you could mess around and tease me. I dunked again for the first time in years. You would’ve been excited to see it, at the gym we used to go to together. I haven’t played video games as much, they remind me of the amount of time I spent playing with you. I don’t get the thrill I used to anymore. I got contacted by our university’s baseball coach. I might end up playing. I remember you got upset at me for choosing you over sports. It’s okay; I was happier with you.",168
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,5,"Mentally, I’ve been doing well. Therapy has been going good. Been working on my communication, especially with how to notice my temper or my impatience and take steps back to just breathe and assess situations. I haven’t been road raging, I know it’s a miracle right? Even in COD, I still play CW by myself sometimes. Haven’t been getting mad. The guys and girls have been wondering about you, since you haven’t been speaking to any of us at all lately. A told me she tried reaching out to you but you were too busy. They were a bit blindsided by everything because we were your best friends. We miss you, miss you playing with us, the car rides picking you up from work, getting boba, KBBQ, shoot even the occasional beers and wings. Everyone is wondering how you’re doing, and no they didn’t pick my side. I wanted everyone to be neutral no matter how close you thought they were to me. A and A are your friends, they wish you’d be around more.",175
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,6,"Oh, I went to the boba spot we tried before you left. The one on San Pedro, when even though we were in the process of breaking up, you were feeding me the Korean corn dogs while I was driving. I went by the park we used to bring Pepper to, just to shoot around a bit. Ran into some of the other dogs there. How has Pepper been? Your mom hasn’t updated me about him. I’m surprised actually, considering she still checks up on me. I hope he’s not too depressed, he was really unhealthy looking during the entire breakup process. I hope he’s been getting out of the house.",111
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,7,"Not sure if you saw on my brother’s snap or the other guy’s snaps, but I finally got that other piercing I was always talking about. For whatever reason I never got it until last month. I also started drafting that sleeve tattoo, my arms got a bit bigger so I was thinking maybe I’ll go with it. It’s hard to decide on what tribal style to get, and what baybayin script to put. Man it’s so fun but hard to decide! Switched my style up a bit, was getting tired of looking really bummy wearing shorts and hoodies all the time. I mean it didn’t change much, but I got a bunch of sweaters and crew necks I can wear out. I think you’d like some lol. That reminds me, you never gave me back my stuff. I have like a crap ton of stuff there. My spare glasses too! You mentioned it early on that you’d give my stuff back, but it’s been like 7 weeks since then.",170
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,8,"Idk if you’d be happy to hear this or not, but I started talking to an old high school crush and went on a couple dates. Sadly, I had to tell her the truth: I wasn’t ready to move forward with anything. I wasn’t ready to fully commit myself and my love into a new relationship. I wouldn’t have been my best for her. I know now that I’m just not ready to love someone else, I’m still working on myself. I remember how you didn’t like when I got attention from girls. It was always a cute thing when you got mad. I know, I know, I shouldn’t tease about it. You were the only one for me before, and until I find that next one, you’ll still have a place in my heart. Now I understand all those songs like “My Boo” and stuff. It’s crazy, I’ve been in tons of relationships and other stuff, but nothing ever hurt like this.",163
z9l7hl,ExNoContact,9,"Anyway, I hope you’ve been taking care of yourself. Toward the end of the relationship, you weren’t doing much for yourself aside from gaming. Have you been keeping up with your homework okay? I remember I was helping you with some of your business assignments and accounting papers. I wish you got out more. Just take care of yourself please. I know you’ve been home from the Philippines for about a week now. I’m glad I haven’t had to run into you around the city, would’ve been awkward. I plan on meeting up with your mom when she gets back too, I have presents from my family to you and yours. I won’t be giving you any sadly. That’s his job now.",122

z9l9ue,confessions,0,I am starting to have feelings for someone I shouldn't have feelings for.,13
z9l9ue,confessions,1,"To start with, I am \[18M\] and is quite the outgoing social type of guy. Recently this college, I've had a friend whom I'll call King \[19M\] have a crush on someone on our block, let's call her Anne \[18M\]. Me being the outgoing social guy I offered to help King have a chance with Anne by first befriending Anne and then providing information about Anne's preferences and thoughts to King to help him understand her more.",77
z9l9ue,confessions,2,"Long story short, I was quite the social friendly out going guy so I've managed to befriend Anne to the point she's comfy to share her personal secrets to me. You could say I've managed to crack her guards down. Just to add Anne is quite the introverted shy person, she's quite secretive in which is the reason why King struggled to know her and accepted my offer of help.",70
z9l9ue,confessions,3,"I've noticed that the longer I interacted with Anne I seem to have gain feelings for her, and it hurts me and my conscience every time I think of it; I feel quite scummy about having feelings for her as originally I only intended to help King set up with her. At first, it was subtle it was probably due to the trust Anne had in me for her to trust her personal secrets to me that made me feel warm, she's even quite pretty to speak of. Normally, we would walk together after college, since I'm the only guy she's quite comfy of but there was one instance where King and Anne was walking together. And I was at the back. I acted I supported King as I was openly supporting them due to my original intention at first to befriend Anne.",143
z9l9ue,confessions,4,"That was the moment, I realized I've gained feelings for Anne. I've never felt so self torn at that moment, I felt so jealous at King and so angry at myself for having feelings at Anne. I'm so angry and sad for why did I even fell for Anne. I've never felt so scummy ever before. I do not want to ruin my friendship with King just to have chance for Anne and I don't really want to tell Anne that I've gained feelings for her. I do not have any idea on what to do. I want this feeling to be gone but the more I push it away the stronger it comes to haunt me back. I genuinely hope for this feelings to be a quick happy crush but at this rate I'm despairing it won't just be a quick happy crush. I genuinely do want to ask your opinion on how should I proceed with this. I do not want to ruin my friendship with King nor do I want to tell Anne that I have feelings for her. I do want to get out of this situation but I do not know how.",197
z9l9ue,confessions,5,But if telling Anne that I have feelings for her is the only way out of the hole I've digged myself in. I'll do it.,25
z9l9ue,confessions,6,"PS: I apologize for any grammar mistakes, I am do not have English as my first language.",17
z9l9ue,confessions,7,What you should do is tell King that you have feelings for Anne. Then decide what to do from there.,20
z9l9ue,confessions,8,If you still want to be friends with King then don't but if you don't care tell Anne you've been telling other people shit she shared with you and see how it works out,34
z9l9ue,confessions,9,Fuck king go for it,5
z9l9ue,confessions,10,I would rather tell Anne I have feelings for her than King.,12
z9l9ue,confessions,11,"I haven't shared any personal secrets of Anne towards King. Actually before me and Anne got friends, I always asked her what she thought of King and I would always ask if King had a chance. I also did told her that I befriended her due to King and I'm thankful I did because I got to know her better. I also already told her that I would forward to king what Anne's preferences are but never her personal secrets.",80
z9l9ue,confessions,12,I am such a coward. For even doing this. I can see how much comfortable Anne is with me and it makes me feel so warm whenever I think of it. She used to sit alone or always sit randomly at our classes but now she always sits around next to me and I think it's sweet. But I can't just be a scummy bastard who steals his friend's crush.,70
z9l9ue,confessions,13,So you are willing to lose King as a friend?,10
z9l9ue,confessions,14,your feelings are a little inappropriate and disrespectful to King. is King even your friend?,15
z9l9ue,confessions,15,"Shoot your shot, but don't expect king to stay friends even if he says he doesn't mind.",17
z9l9ue,confessions,16,"Your friend is the coward and you would be betraying her, yourself and probably breaking her heart if you did nothing and left her to that idiot",27
z9l9ue,confessions,17,I don't know man King is quite also straightforward to her about his feelings its just that Anne isn't quite comfy with him. I really don't want to fuck up with King but if I have no other choice I'll probably talk it out with her it's just that I'm still hesitating.,52
z9l9ue,confessions,18,"Just tell her how you feel, if she's into you just tell your friend you tried to set him up with a date and she said no because she was into you",32
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,0,Got backstabbed at the pre-sale for the show in Amsterdam,10
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,1,Yesterday I received an e-mail regarding the pre-sale that was promised by Abel and the XO team for previous ticket owners of the After Hours tour.,26
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,2,"Back when the After Hours Till Dawn tour was announced, Abel put out an instagram post in which he explained the reasoning for cancelling the previous dates. He also stated that previous ticket owners would receive priority in buying tickets for new dates.",43
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,3,"So yesterday I signed up for the pre-sale link. It stated that because I had bought tickets before I had early access to the tickets. But then I saw a TikTok add from Mojo (the promotor of the tour in the Netherlands), which stated that by clicking the link and signing up to their newsletter, subscribers would receive the link to the pre-sale as well.",65
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,4,So I asked my friend to do just that and it turned out that people without previous tickets would also get access to the pre-sale.,25
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,5,I realized that it would be a hassle to get tickets since everyone had access to the pre-sale which was promised to only the previous ticket holders.,27
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,6,And today I didn’t manage to get the tickets I was promised and instead was waiting in a queue behind 20.000 others (that is more than the capacity of the previous venue).,32
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,7,"It’s safe to say I am deeply disappointed in the way this was handled and I honestly feel betrayed by the XO team and Abel. I don’t know how much they could’ve done about this and if this was truly their fault, but they failed to keep their promises and I am gutted.",53
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,8,"As a longtime XO fan this was my first time seeing Abel live and I was waiting in excitement since 2020, but I honestly don’t feel like going through this process again tomorrow at the regular ticket sale.",38
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,9,"I’m sorry for ranting on here, it just feels as though there is no real place to address this to the XO team other than to share my story with you guys.",32
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,10,"If anyone has experienced the same thing as me, then please let me know in the thread below!",18
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,11,Bro I was in the queue behind 22k people. As soon as I got to the end they put me back in the back of the fucking queue,28
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,12,"For those who are from Amsterdam, maybe you could buy tickets for Brussels in Belgium. I got mine at the presales and I just checked now (15.41h) and there are still tickets left at the presale.",36
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,13,"Same thing happened to me mate. I even had 3 tickets secured, transferred to my banking app to approve the payment, then after approving ticket master told me my details were incorrect. This happened for two different cards. I lost the tickets and now there aren't any left on pre-sale.",50
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,14,"We had three tickets bought for the arena tour. We were told we'd be given priority for the stadium tour and we haven't been. That combined with less tour dates, and some countries that had dates now being omitted from the tour, really leaves a bad taste in the mouth.",50
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,15,"Yeah that priority shit was a giant scam by Ticketmaster. I received no emails about a presale and I just had to make a Live Nation account to have access to pre sale. I was fortunate that the European venues were easy to get tickets to, but its absolutely horrid what happened in UK and France.",56
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,16,"Contact a customer union, get info on your local/national laws.",10
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,17,"Edit : TicketMaster don't give a shit, they don't even have a customer support in my country.",17
z9lwh7,TheWeeknd,18,TM scammed us all. Went through a 20k line just to get placed back in line. Was lucky and tried my work phone and got through eventually. Paid a ton for those standing tickets man. Not to mention the pricing of the tickets in general,45

z9mhep,relationships,0,BF broke up with me because I'm taking too long to heal from work-related trauma,15
z9mhep,relationships,1,Warning: long post!,3
z9mhep,relationships,2,"My ex (27m) and I (27f) met because we both worked/studied at the same place. He had been there a lot longer than I had, everyone there knew him and loved him. I was new, and still making an impression. I knew I loved him the moment I saw him.",50
z9mhep,relationships,3,"We started dating pretty quickly, and things were going well. But work started going downhill, I realised that one of my managers (33f) felt competitive with me and essentially hated my guts for no reason. I found out later that she'd had a thing for my ex. I tried a lot of mediation etc to get her to work with me in a civil manner, but that ended in a screaming match with her yelling at me in the middle of a hallway at work. This happened about a year into working there. When I tried to seek support from other managers (37m/55m), I was told that I was being selfish, two-faced and money driven. My relationship came up as being something that was apparently distracting me from work. I was incredibly damaged after this and I don't think I processed it as the pandemic had just started.",148
z9mhep,relationships,4,"My ex and I moved in together around this time. He is very close with his family and over time he told me they were my family too. For context, I have no family in the country where I work and a fairly small friend circle. He became my world, and I did any and every thing for him and his family. I could feel myself losing bits of me, but it felt easier to focus on the relationship, rather than deal with the reality of my managers at work.",90
z9mhep,relationships,5,"He did tell me quite early on into moving in together that it was stressful for him to be around me because I was sad and depressed about work a lot of the time, and he tried to leave me a month into moving in together. (He came back the next morning and apologised profusely)",55
z9mhep,relationships,6,"But we stayed together for 2.5 years after moving in together. Yes we had fights and he often said he needed space, but I thought we were working through it. He kept wanting me to be around his family, and I was okay with it, even though at times I felt they could be very overbearing. They often made jokes that would trigger my anxiety, and this was aggravated by the fact that i hadnt been able to see my family for over 2 years because of the pandemic. His family became my family, i baked cakes at all of their birthdays and i always got presents for all extended family members at Christmas. We often talked about marriage and children, even though he initially said he didn't believe in it, he said he could picture that future with me.",140
z9mhep,relationships,7,"Earlier this year, I got a new part time job that I really loved. But over time, I realised I didn't fit into his world anymore. I could feel us growing distant as we were no longer working together, and he wasn't very supportive of my new job. Around this time, I realised how much the incident with my manager had affected me, and I started getting help. My ex was not very supportive of my mental health journey, I thought it was because he had become numb to how anxious and depressed I always was. Our fights became more frequent, and his arguments became more personal as he would call me a terrible, rude person. I acknowledge my part in this as the smallest things would set me off, and I was getting angry and anxious at things that usually wouldn't bother me. But we still had our good times, we would still talk about our future together, and how things would be so much better once I was fully wrapped up at my old job and settled full time into my new one.",185
z9mhep,relationships,8,"Fast forward to two weeks ago, all my hard work of the year had culminated into a big week of events. I was very excited and hopeful for this week, as it was huge career wise for me. There was also going to be a party at my old work place- my ex's workplace at the end of that week and I wanted to go and say goodbye to my old colleagues. We went out for his brother's birthday at the beginning of that week and had a lovely time, I felt closer to my ex and his family than I have in a long time. On our walk home, my ex told me that he didn't want me to go to the party at his workplace because he wanted to enjoy himself and not worry about me getting anxious. I was upset that he felt that way, and the fight escalated until he said he hated our relationship and didn't want to be with me anymore.",167
z9mhep,relationships,9,"I was very hurt, but I acknowledged his feelings and we decided to take our space. My work events were successful, but I couldn't enjoy them because I was so devastated. He moved out to his mom's house after that week, and we tried to stay in touch but he put zero effort into keeping the conversation up. We met up a week later and I asked what was going on. He told me that he was firm in not wanting a relationship, and he didn't love me the way he should. I asked if we could work on it together, and he said no, that he needed to not be in a relationship for at least a month. And then maybe we could talk next year. I slept on it, and decided that it was unfair of him to leave me hanging for that long. I asked him to move all of his stuff out and I haven't seen him since. Ive said a lot of terrible things out of anger, asked to go NC and I fear that I've ruined any chances of reconciliation. It's been a week, and I still can't stop crying. The more time that passes, the more I realise how little he cared/loved me. I keep wishing he'll text, but he hasn't.",218
z9mhep,relationships,10,"I am so hurt and devastated that it ended this way after 3.5 years. I was so close to him and his family, and I feel like I'm losing a whole family along with this relationship. It's his birthday in a few days and I don't know if I should wish him. I feel so hurt and lost. I still haven't recovered from my workplace incident and I just don't know if I'll ever be okay again. Part of me wonders if he lost love and respect for me because I couldn't cut it at his workplace. Feeling really devastated and heartbroken- I gave this relationship my all when I had so little to give, and my anxiety has been at an all time high. I don't know if he even misses me. I keep blaming myself for the breakup and I don't know how to stop. Sorry about the long post, I just needed to get this out of my system.",162

z9mrge,artbusiness,0,What do you do with a customer who decides that they don't like something about the piece that they bought?,20
z9mrge,artbusiness,1,"I'm an art photographer who recently participated in an open studio tour. I had a customer who liked a piece, asked me to have it printed 24 X 30 on aluminum. I delivered it. He opened it and noticed a couple places where there was black on the image. He said something was wrong. I showed him that those places were black on the original but told him that I could edit and reprint. I told him, honestly, that I want him to be happy hanging the work and that I would pay for the reprint. He returned the copy that he was unhappy with.",105
z9mrge,artbusiness,2,"I edited the piece, got his approval and sent out for a reprint. I sold the piece for $325. The two prints together will cost me more than that. So, last night I sent him a text and asked if he'd pitch in for the cost of the reprint. He has not yet answered. Now I go back and forth feeling like a cad for asking after I said I'd cover the cost and thinking that it's not unreasonable to not want to lose money on a sale where the client stared at the piece for a long time before asking for the print and it was delivered exactly as it looked when he bought it.",116
z9mrge,artbusiness,3,What would you have done in my place?,8

z9mrge,artbusiness,9,You can't really ask that after saying you'd cover it.,10
z9mrge,artbusiness,10,"If someone gave you something for free and then ask for something, you probably wouldn't.",15
z9mrge,artbusiness,11,"Next time, plan ahead and offer a reduce cost for the next print (maybe even at cost - make no profit but don't lose money).",25
z9mrge,artbusiness,12,"If the piece was $325 and the printing costs $100, you should have told the client, “listen, here’s what we’ll do. A reprint will cost $200. I’ll split it with you. Shipping will be about $50.”",36
z9mrge,artbusiness,13,"That would sound like you’re helping them out, when in fact, you’re not.",13
z9mrge,artbusiness,14,"Honestly, you can't change your mind on the price after the fact. If that same situation were to happen in the future you should send a digital proof for approval before you print & charge more for the reprint post proof approval because it's custom work. I understand reprints if the printer is faulty, but to replace a perfectly good piece is admitting fault where there is none.",68
z9mrge,artbusiness,15,"Thanks everyone. He offered to chip in an extra $50 and I told him that I'd stick to my original offer. The prints are almost $200 each, so I'll lose a bit on this sale. I'm just going to chalk it up to a learning experience.",46
z9mrge,artbusiness,16,"You can't change the price after you've already sent out the piece. That's very odd and unprofessional. Not making a reprint, or asking money for it ahead of time, would have been reasonable. But once you agreed to it, you can't really change it.",44
z9mrge,artbusiness,17,Maybe you can sell the original print to someone else and recoup some of the money that way? Assuming the customer doesn't agree to pay your new price.,28
z9mrge,artbusiness,18,Don't edit your shit after the fact like that. All sales are final.,13
z9mrge,artbusiness,19,"It depends. If the customer got something other than what they purchased, I try to examine what happened and eat the screwup. It has happened maybe 3 times in the last 5 years. If a customer got something as advertised, and make complaints, I do nothing to fix it. If they want to customize their print its $175 per hour for alterations with no refunds on the labor.",68
z9mrge,artbusiness,20,"The vast majority of people are good, but there is a small percentage of people who will take advantage of you and ask for things out of line. One example I had about 10-11 years ago was a guy who wanted to buy five giclee prints from me. Big order, but I have done it before. He wanted to show them to his wife, have her pick out one, and then return the other 4 and have me refund him his money. I told him these were all print to order and my business policy (which is stated on my website) is that I do not return prints that are not defective (and uhhh, if I delivery the prints and they look fine, and you tell me they are defective, we are both going to know you are lying).",139
z9mrge,artbusiness,21,"He responded with ""Well you know, at Costco you can return stuff, I don't see how this is any different"". I told him this isn't Costco, I am a small business, I do not have warehouses for inventory, he wanted stuff that i would have to pay for and then deal with. I asked him to show his wife pictures and then ask which one she wants ""I want it to be a surprise for her!, you know, something nice"". I explained that it was more or less me doing something for his wife as I would have to eat the cost. These were people who were probably 55-60 at the time. His wife is an adult. She can pick which one she wants on the computer screen.",128
z9mrge,artbusiness,22,"The other time I can recall was an institution where the manager had to approve of the picture. Everyone loves the art, but the manager wanted to make some color alterations. I am convinced they did so because they are a task master (look up the Bullshit Jobs book for the Task Master) and need to have their hands on everything, even things which do not actively require management. His job wasn't to make sure things look good, his job was to add steps so it shows he was participating. This is where the $175 per hour for alterations comes from.",101
z9mrge,artbusiness,23,"Usually, if someone buys something and dislike it, thats on them. Its my job to deliver what they ordered, not to cater to their every need.",26
z9mrge,artbusiness,24,"I hate to say it, but I agree, you can't go back on your offer. That said, I wouldn't feel too bad about asking, they might have been happy to do it and it all would have worked. You could now recover by writing back and saying after you had a minute to think on it you feel bad about asking and want to continue with your original agreement.",69
z9mrge,artbusiness,25,"And then you can chalk this up to the cost of education. Some people pay thousands to go to college, this was one of your lessons. In future you'll do things a little different.",34
z9mrge,artbusiness,26,Congrats on the sale!,4
z9mrge,artbusiness,27,"Yeah I have had this happen time and time again. Sometimes I worked for like 2.5$ an hour if you count it, because I would take on a huge project for like 400$ but then spend an eternity finishing the piece and then the client would ask for a revision.",50
z9mrge,artbusiness,28,Always makes me... aggravated.,4
z9mrge,artbusiness,29,So I bumped up the prices. You never know how the job will go or who the client is as an individual. Being an artist is a great journey - the career takes you for a friggin ride.,38
z9mrge,artbusiness,30,I don't think any of the Disney animators thought they would work at Disney.,14
z9mrge,artbusiness,31,"Well, I wouldn’t have asked for payment after saying it wasn’t required, but since that is where you are, you could either A. Leave it and not message them again or B. Send them another message apologizing for asking for payment and telling them not to worry about it, you can try to make up something about extra fees you were charged that you didn’t expect or something but it’s a bad look to have asked for payment after saying it would be free.",84
z9mrge,artbusiness,32,"1. Make sure the customer has access to very clear images of the piece, from multiple angles if necessary to show what it looks like with light reflecting off of it if that makes a difference, which in this case, it seems like it might.",45
z9mrge,artbusiness,33,"2. If this isn’t a commissioned piece, don’t offer to edit it. The EXCEPTION would be if there’s a glaring issue that multiple customers are noticing and pointing out. The customer not liking the use of black on part of the image is an issue with the customer’s personal taste, and not your work. Don’t sacrifice integrity to make a sale.",61
z9mrge,artbusiness,34,"3. If you’ve already stated you’ll cover the cost, *cover the cost.* Do not ask a buyer for extra money after you’ve stated you’ll pay for a reprint. You’re just going to have to eat that loss at that point. If you weren’t sure how to handle this, you could’ve told the buyer “I’ll see what I can do, and get back to you.” Then take some time to think about how to handle the situation or ask for advice if needed.",82
z9mrge,artbusiness,35,You cant ask for money from the client. You should always before printing get a client to sign a proof sheet.,21
z9mrge,artbusiness,36,"This way you are covered for this very situation. You'd of been able to show they approved the first print ""as is"".",22
z9mrge,artbusiness,37,"As you didn't do that and offered to edit and reprint at your own cost, you will have to just accept the loss.",23
z9mrge,artbusiness,38,You can put the first print up for sale though if its not a photo of the client themselves or a person without a model release.,26
z9mrge,artbusiness,39,"It happens ... an assumption of fees illustrates how critically important rates are. ""Let me verify another copy fee and shipping and I'll get back to you.""",27
z9mrge,artbusiness,40,"In the future , the price of your print should always be the cost x 2.5. This allows for errors like this, while adding a little wiggle room to make a profit in this worse case scenario.",37
z9mrge,artbusiness,41,Can you list it as ready to ship holiday offer and try to get a sale that way?,18
z9mrge,artbusiness,42,I did pay thousands to go to college and business school to boot. I know better. I'm not thinking straight.,20
z9mrge,artbusiness,43,He offered to kick in an extra $50 and I told him never mind.,14
z9mrge,artbusiness,44,"In fairness to myself, the customer saw the piece at an art show. He looked at it for a good ten minutes. He didn't take that physical piece only because I'd dropped it and there was chip on the edge where it hit the pavement and I insisted that he have an intact piece.",54
z9mrge,artbusiness,45,The original one ?,4
z9mrge,artbusiness,46,"so you flip flop on him, and then when he said yes, you flip flop again. and entire change was for customer who knew what they had.",27
z9mrge,artbusiness,47,"you gotta stop this, or you will never get off the ground",12
z9mrge,artbusiness,48,"Yeah, that would be odd, then, that he’d complain about the black color when he saw it up close and in person!",22
z9mrge,artbusiness,49,I can try. I don't sell a ton of my work and have never sold anything online.,17
z9mrge,artbusiness,50,You're right. I messed this one up.,7

z9ny6c,ContractorUK,2,"I’m a social worker who’s just left a permanent role and is now working through an agency. Before starting i had a few people warn me about going agency mostly telling me to beware of dodgy umbrella companies. I started my new role last week and everything seems to be going OK I submitted my hours to my agency on Friday and I’d already worked out on moneysupermarket that for my hourly rate and hours I should come home with around £850 per week after tax, NI and student loan.",90
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,3,"Anyway, yesterday I receive a phone call from a man who said he was from the umbrella company who worked with my agency and wanted to talk me through a couple of different methods of payment before my first wage comes through this Friday.",44
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,4,"He proceeds to offer me two options, please bare in mind I am not clued on on tax so if this does not make much sense it may be because I have not remembered the info correctly. He tells me the first option and leads with the amount I’ll be getting paid which was around £1150 per week. At this point alarm bells are already ringing as it is significantly higher than what I have worked out I should be taking home myself.",83
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,5,"He tells me all I need to do is put aside £72 per week and when HMRC come around in April I will pay them the money I’ve put aside and explained that this was just the accounting side of things (didn’t make sense to me but he carries on) he then says they will need to pay me into two separate bank accounts, one will have around 750 paid into it and the other will have around 350 paid into it and explained that 1 of the payments is ‘profit’ (I don’t understand what this means either?). He said if I choose this route they will send me a contract to sign - baring in mind I have already signed a contract when I first started with my agency. He also said I might prefer this route because I wouldn’t have to make any student loan contributions.",148
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,6,"He then said that the second option entails me being paid into 1 bank account and coming out with around £850 per week, my student loan contributions will be made and it is through a ‘PAYE’ method. He also said I will also be optics into a pension scheme which I can opt out of. This option seemed far less complicated and aligned with what I had already pre-empted my pay to be.",73
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,7,I told him I would have a think and let him know what I would prefer in the morning. I have done quite a lot of googling and have spent most of last night and this morning learning about umbrella companies and the horrendous loan charge scandal. From what I had learnt I felt option 2 would be the legit way and rang him this morning to say I would like to take the lower amount and make my student loan contributions he said this was fine and was polite enough.,91
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,8,"My first question is, is what they are offering illegal? My second is should I change umbrella companies completely? I’m fairly certain they are dodgy but I feel confident I have chosen the right option, I just don’t want to experience any trouble with HMRC later down the line from the collateral of any potential trouble my umbrella company might find themselves in. This is my first role outside of a perm contract and I am a fairly young social worker (24) this job is all I have ever done since graduating and I am passionate about it so do not want to do anything that might risk my career or future.",112
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,9,Any advice / comments welcome,5
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,10,tell your agency and move to paystream,7
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,11,Option 2 would be the legitimate option.,7
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,12,Option 1 appears that you would be declared as a company or as a sole trader. Its up to yourself but if you want the easier option and are happy with the amount I would do with option 2.,39
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,13,Is the contract inside IR35 or outside?,7
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,14,if its in the option 2 is likely to be correct.. if its outside then you should setup a ltd company and you sort your tax affairs yourself..,28
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,15,with ANY umbrella you should be logging onto your personal HMRC tax account to ensure they are actually paying your taxes for you regardless of what it says on your payslip - do this every single month regardless... HMRC have made it quite plain in the past that if they/you have been scammed out of your tax money they don't care and want it anyway from you pronto - with the dodgy options your being presented I would disengage from this company immediately...,83
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,16,As a side note I've used NASA in the past and they paid my taxes - notice I didn't say they were good... all umbrellas should really all be the same as you are essentially buying a payroll service thats it..,41
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,17,"Option 2, just make sure you're receiving your holiday pay and they're not skimming it off.",16
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,18,Worthwhile staying in the pension imo.,6
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,19,"OP, you've got your head screwed on just right. If an offer seems ""too good to be true"" then it usually is.",22
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,20,"If the end client is in the public sector then I'd suggest letting them know. I am not clued up enough on tax to know what ruse the brolly is pulling, but it feel pretty shady.",36
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,21,I hope I am not too late. Do not go with option one! An umbrella company that suggests paying money in 2 different bank accounts smell really bad... period.,29
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,22,"It is important to remember that Umbrella Companies don't have ""a statutory definition"" for HMRC. Therefore as long as HMRC is aware, an Umbrella Company is like a normal permanent employer. So it is different because you are now an agency worker but how you will be paid shouldn't.",49
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,23,We created this calculator where you can calculate your Umbrella Pay very accurately: [https://payslipbuddy.co.uk/umbrella-company-calculator](https://payslipbuddy.co.uk/umbrella-company-calculator),14
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,24,"If the money you receive is way higher than what was returned to the calculator, I would advise you to run. But anyway, based on what they suggested, I would leave them anyway. I can't see how option 1 is not a DR Scheme.",44
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,25,"The next thing you should do is create your tax account on the HMRC website. A few workers know this, but all workers can create a free account with HMRC and see each week how much income tax and NIC your employer (here the umbrella company) paid to HMRC: [https://www.gov.uk/personal-tax-account](https://www.gov.uk/personal-tax-account)",50
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,26,Hope it helps ✌️,4
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,27,Thanks I will look into paystream today,7
z9ny6c,ContractorUK,28,happy to answer further questions too -,7

Everything was normal and I usually keep a smile on. After the meeting my father and him went together, while I went back home on my own.",51
z9o4fa,confessions,2,"My father just asked me to send his friend 3$ (Its decent money here, 3rd world shit) so he could eat something and had nothing in his pocket at all, didn't tell anyone, didn't show any signs, might have been hungry the whole day, who knows. My father was pissed at him for not asking even though we dont have not alot but it's heartbreaking to know someone respectable, never lied, never cheated, works for a non profit, is hungry since god knows when while being sick.",87

z9obf5,legaladvice,3,"Actually, in North Carolina, it is legal for an employer to recover money to cover cash shortages and loss from employee wages, provided the employee is given notice of the deduction 7 days in advance, (or if they were given a blanket agreement at the start of their employment,) and the deduction doesn't take the employee below minimum wage for the pay period.

z9p1tm,travel,0,Dual citizenship and the agony of traveling with 2 passports. Pls help :),13
z9p1tm,travel,1,"Hello lovely people,",3
z9p1tm,travel,2,Hoping to get advice from someone who was maybe in the same/similar situation as I'm getting quite desperate.,18
z9p1tm,travel,3,As the title says - I have dual citizenship - 2 passports - one is EU (Croatian) and the other is non-EU.,22
z9p1tm,travel,4,"* Currently, I live in the Netherlands with my EU passport - all good, no problems there.",17
z9p1tm,travel,5,"* Due to an upcoming trip, as part of the visa application process, the South African Embassy took and kept my EU passport. Big disorganization, unprofessionalism, and the fact they are not telling me when can I get my passport back is another topic.",44
z9p1tm,travel,6,"**Question** \- I must travel outside of the EU next week. I think exiting the Netherlands with my other non-EU passport should be ok - I don't think they care, but how does it work when I want to enter the country again? Can they decline my entry? *(I should note that I have never entered the EU with my non-EU passport so If I leave now, they will only see that somehow, I'm in Europe now, trying to leave it and then trying to come back) .*",88
z9p1tm,travel,7,"And no, I don't have an EU ID - that is my mistake - first thing ill do once I get my passport back.",24

z9p1tm,travel,9,"Edit: I could not find one person to tell me it's a good idea to leave the country with a non-EU passport so I decided not to risk it. Missed a flight, spammed the embassy with calls until I got my EU passport back, and booked a new flight. (Spent a few hundreds extra in the process, gotta love these unplanned spendings :)).",63
z9p1tm,travel,10,You will have have an issue leaving Netherlands as you do. not have an entry stamp in your Non EU passport.,21
z9p1tm,travel,11,"With Schengen zone as there is controlled entry ie everyone scanned in & out , it’s essential same passport is used .",22
z9p1tm,travel,12,We only had to leave once without same passport and we had a police report that the original passport that was used had gone missing.,25
z9p1tm,travel,13,Maybe if you show some documentation that passport is being kept for a visa ( not sure if they will care ) likely you could be detained for further questioning and possibly miss flight or not be allowed to exit.,40
z9p1tm,travel,14,Get to airport early. Possibly call dutch immigration and ask what if anything can be done,16
z9p1tm,travel,15,Contact your embassy for advice. Everyone here is trying to help but your embassy might even be able to give you an expedited passport or resolve the matter with SA,30
z9p1tm,travel,16,">as part of the visa application process, the South African Embassy took and kept my EU passport",17
z9p1tm,travel,17,"This is pretty average for visa processing. I've had the same done when moving to Italy, or visiting Russia for example. It has nothing to do w/ being a dual citizen. Having two passports is actually very handy in this regard so you are never without one.",47

I have a problem with them being unprofessional - they said they need 15 working days to process visa. Out of nowhere, they started making up some new rules and said it will be a month and a half instead and would not return any of my calls/emails since.",71
z9p1tm,travel,24,"Yes you can definitely do that. Problem is if you didn’t enter on it , and now need to leave & don’t have the EU one in hand or EU Id card to exit the schengen. Trust me the border guards are not happy when the entry and exit stamps don’t match up",53
z9p1tm,travel,25,"Please don't do this. Your original passport will be invalidated. You're better off going to the South African embassy, withdraw your visa application and retrieve your passport.",27

z9p1tm,travel,32,"Thank you! Will do :) Just in case I don't you can assume I was detained and imprisoned for ""suspicious activities"" 😂",22
z9p1tm,travel,33,All visa / passport related stuff has gone seriously down hill everywhere since covid ( think they are missing people / or no one wants to work ),28

Well, the whole thing is autism resources have saved my life. And understanding that I perhaps wasn’t weird and just a little difference made me feel a lot more confident after years of school bullying. But I don’t want an official diagnosis. I don’t want medical help because doctors are often rude or invalidating and I am sensitive. I also don’t want it because I don’t want it to bother my future jobs. I don’t know.

z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,3,"That being said, you’re still welcome here without a diagnosis. I just got mine a month ago, but it also took me a year before that to even decide if I wanted one. And honestly: I mainly got it to combat imposter syndrome.",43
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,4,self referral is valid too!!,5
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,5,Self diagnosis is supported by autism scientists:,7

z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,7,"They say: ""We believe that if you have carefully researched the topic and strongly resonate with the experience of the autistic community, you are probably autistic.""",26
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,8,I have never related to a post more in my entire life. It’s really nice to see the validation from the community around self diagnosis and the awkward path it takes to get there,34
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,9,"My therapist who diagnosed me advised me not to get an official diagnosis as it can limit my future, such as if I want to adopt or foster or move to another country. She said only if I feel like I need the help. It’s sad that an official diagnosis is so limiting 😞",54
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,10,"I tried to get diagnosed but my mom said there was nothing weird about me growing up at all meanwhile she is probably autistic too, but my doc was just like 🤷‍♀️ you seem normal!",35
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,11,"After the immigration to New Zealand stuff coming out I've personally decided against it. Not that that's in the plans at all, but I'm sure there are many more ableist policies we don't know about.",35
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,12,"If I need accommodations I think any company that requires proof instead of just listening to me isn't really something I want to support. Though if it's for official reasons and not a reflection of the employer themselves, I have my adhd diagnosis that I can use.",47
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,13,"Idk, just seems like the world is against us no matter what we do, we just get to pick the flavour of discrimination.",23
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,14,"This happened with a weird number of parents at the school I used to teach at. Refusing to let their kids access help and resources but only about autism and adhd. Depression and other mental health was helped with, but not these. So much ableism. You don't need an official diagnosis to say you are autistic in my opinion, if you've really looked into it and the words ""autism resources have saved my life"" sounds like you have. I have a diagnosis and I think it's gatekeeping bullshit and I was only able to access those services when telehealth exploded thanks to COVID. Since things like parents, bias, money, health insurance, lack of resources, racism, sexism, all make the system ineffective and inequitable, and traumatizing, requiring someone to go through that system to have an outsider judge their inner experience and life is morally wrong, in my opinion. Does that mean maybe sometimes people will claim they're autistic and not be? Yeah. Yes, absolutely, people will be wrong and incorrectly diagnose sometimes. I don't care, because the alternative is more autistic people suffering without resources and validation, which is what we have now and it sucks. We have rampant misdiagnosis and prejudice by out-of-date 'experts'. It's a mess.",208
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,15,"If you feel like you need what resources are being kept away from you, then you can decide if you want to wade into the morass. But if you want one for permission to recognize your identity and your needs? You don't need one, you're autistic, and you already sound like you are on the right path to understanding that and finding resources.",63
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,16,"My mom doesn’t think I’m autistic even though I am professionally diagnosed. Also, I graduated with my bachelor’s in 3 years cum laude & got my master’s degree at the age of 22 & am still autistic, so the capability thing is a load of crap :)",47
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,17,"Self-diagnosis is valid! I know it’s hard with doubting parents, but my mom knows the inner workings of my mind and body about as well as I know hers (not at all). Parents think they know more than they do about their children, so just remember that you know yourself better than your parents. My dad (who is probably also autistic) scored me a lot higher on the parent questionnaire from the doctor who assessed me than my mom did; just shows that what is visible on the outside can be interpreted differently depending who is looking.",97
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,18,"You know your inner self and your own mind better than anyone else. If you are able to access the resources you need without an official diagnosis there is no need to subject yourself to uncomfortable medical situations before you are ready or feel you need to, if that should change in the future. You are totally right that doctors can be rude and invalidating. Many do not seem to keep up with research in their field and have outdated and disproven ideas about autism and other comorbid conditions, and honestly, both general mental health *and* general women's health, so we have a *shit ton* of hurdles to overcome navigating that system a lot of times. Without supportive caretakers it is even harder.",123
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,19,You don't need an official diagnosis to discuss with any future counselors/therapists/whatever either. You also don't need an official diagnosis to be able to disclose to whoever you feel comfortable disclosing to that you are autistic. No one is going to ask for a doctor's note. ❤,47
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,20,"A lot of people with diagnosed autism ""function decently"". It can actually help you understand yourself and your needs better so that you know how to make your life easier. Not everyone has to know about it if you don't want them to, I haven't told my boss even though I've been at my workplace for 3 years. :) I'm 28 and I just got my official diagnosis in the summertime even though both my mom and I suspected I was autistic since I was like 12. I've been through the same thing with being bullied in school, and I could never understand why because I was just being myself. One of my teachers I think could kinda tell, and she was so kind to me. She was like a mother figure and she would tell me all the time, ""it's okay to be different.""",145
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,21,I'm 30 years older than you and I'm just figuring it out now. My awesome 12 year old daughter is autistic.,21
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,22,"Since her diagnosis 9 years I've been educating myself about autism and women with autism. About 3 years ago it finally started to click for me. Sooo many things began to make sense. All the things that were hard for me growing up, people thinking I was ""weird"", the social difficulties I've had (and still have), the way I was speech delayed (I thought it was because of the extreme strife going on at home).",75
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,23,Anyway. I still don't know if I will seek an official diagnosis. I hear such horror stories about practitioners who don't know shit about autism but are somehow allowed to diagnose it.,32
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,24,"Long story short, I feel you and I wish you happiness. ❤️",12
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,25,"Self diagnosis is valid. And I'm so glad you've figure it out at your age. How I wish autism was even on my radar when I was 19. Unfortunately, like most people, my understanding of autism was limited. But then again, it's only been recently that we've had more studies done and have understood it better, especially how it displays itself in women.",63
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,26,You're on the right track!,5
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,27,"it's a shame that ableism and internalised ableism prevent people from seeking a diagnosis but it is a very real problem. if you don't want a diagnosis that's okay, you're more than okay to say you suspect you're autistic and to inform whoever you want so that they can help you better",52
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,28,"a diagnosis can be very helpful but depending on where you live and your personal life it could unfortunately also negatively affect you. do not feel you have to 'decide' now. autism doesn't go away so if you find yourself wanting a diagnosis in the future that's okay too! if you find you don't need the accommodations or it will hinder you then don't feel you need to get one, after all you're allowed to say you suspect you're autistic or you have autistic traits, there's nothing wrong with that",90
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,29,"Well, you could wait a bit and decide later! I’m 2x as old as you are, and I’m just doing it now. But do consider doing it at some point so you can get support or financial benefits if you need them in the future.",45
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,30,"Self diagnosis is valid. I did get officially diagnosed, but despite having a decent career, I may need accommodations. I haven't officially disclosed my diagnosis, but if they take away our telework days I would take my diagnostic assessment from my psychologist that recommended less hours and more telework.",49
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,31,"I am looking into a lower stress field and/or a position that isn't full-time (I am fortunate that I can consider this and I know it's not possible for everyone), so I can get back from burnout and embrace my creative side. I am trying to engage with my special interest in music but I cannot work 40 hours every week and have energy to play my flute.",68
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,32,"I've strongly suspected for two and a half years that I have autism, but I don't want a formal diagnosis. The reasons are:",23
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,33,"\- I live in the US and a diagnosis is really expensive, even with health insurance",16
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,34,"\- It seems there are a lot of psychiatrists that have an outdated view of autism, especially autism in women or any traits that don't fit the Rain Man sort of stereotypes, and don't want someone uninformed invalidating my experience",40
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,35,\- My therapist is an autistic woman who specializes in autism and agrees that I'm autistic,16
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,36,"You have plenty of time to get diagnosed if you want to. Many people get diagnosed later in life, even in middle age or old age. The actor Anthony Hopkins got diagnosed in his 70s. I'd say take it slow and don't do anything you don't want to just because of societal pressure or ignorant people who look down on self diagnosis.",62
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,37,"You don’t have to get a diagnosis if you don’t want to! There’s not a massive benefit to having an autism diagnosis in the UK, because it doesn’t get you any help or medication whereas an ADHD assessment lets you get access to medication.",44
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,38,"A lot of professionals are also pretty late to the autism research party. They still think to be autistic you have to be an non verbal boy who is aggressive. You could end up getting assessed by an old school psych who might end up invalidating you and making you feel worse. Self diagnosis is valid in the autistic community, I work in mental health and we assume anyone referred/asked for an assessment has autism because it’s very hard to get an assessment on the NHS, so self diagnosis is also valid in healthcare settings too. I think as long as you know yourself and you’re happy to not have a professional confirm it for you then I think you should use the autism label if you feel it fits you!",131
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,39,My NHS psychiatrist diagnosed me but he’s not a neurodevelopmental specialist so I still need an “official assessment.” I’m not going to bother because it won’t get me anything extra. In fact during COVID our government used having a diagnosis of autism/any major disability like Down syndrome as a reason to stop disabled people getting ventilators. I’m also assuming in the US or any other insurance based country having an official diagnosis could make your insurance more expensive?,78
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,40,I feel the same way. I function with support and fortunate circumstances,12
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,41,Personally I see no need for a medical diagnosis unless it is necessary for government aid. What I DO suggest is finding a good therapist who is also ND/Autistic to help you navigate a world built for neurotypicals. My life has been made infinitely easier for mine!,47
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,42,I am self diagnosed. My father was diagnosed late in life. I started suspecting that I was when he received his diagnosis. My confirmation came when my daughter was up for an updated eval for her adhd diagnosis. The doctor removed her adhd diagnosis and diagnosed autism. When the doctor was going through her autistic traits I could’ve cried. One because I always knew she was autistic and two because all of the listed traits are traits my daughter shares with me.,82
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,43,A lot of the signs of autism are also signs of other neurological conditions. ADHD and schizophrenia as 2 examples. Find a psychologist you click with and work through things with them to get an outside opinion,37
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,44,"The amount of times I’ve been told “really? I would have never guessed” by people I’ve told about my diagnosis, it’s happened so many times.",25
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,45,"If you don't want a diagnosis, that's entirely your choice.",10
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,46,"For me personally, it was a relief. But I can see where it could make things more difficult for me, too. But that's okay. I'll get to where I need to be. Whatever your choice is, it's completely valid, and you're welcome to be here as a fellow autist with or without diagnosis :)",54
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,47,"Self-diagnosis is absolutely valid & is supported. I’m formally diagnosed & I wish I never had been as I experienced severe discrimination & bullying for it, even as an adult.",30
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,48,I hope you haven’t silenced the thread cus of the comments cus I wanna say thanks. I’ve had a few resources in my notes to copy paste over the years and this is a great one to put minds at ease of those who aren’t lucky enough to have access to easy diagnosis via social healthcare/limited by worry of job prospects like OP. I think everyone here needs a lil comfort,71

z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,50,"ngl that quote made me weepy. I've been going back and forth as to whether or not its ethical and 'okay' for me to diagnose myself as autistic or even internally refer to myself as such, even though I've strongly suspected I am for almost 10 years now... And moreso the experiences of being autistic have strongly resonated with me and my experience for years. that quote provided a little bit of validation.",73
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,51,Thank you for this comment.,5
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,52,[deleted],1
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,53,"Curious- how is moving to another country limited by an official diagnosis of autism? Also, are autistic adults not allowed to adopt in the U.S.?",25
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,54,Same I noticed my parents have autistic traits as well. Like they always get the weird stares at dinner parties… and I thought I was bad,26
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,55,"I don’t think being autistic is all about being and acting weird. Our daughter is actually more normal than most children her age, I’m guessing you could say that’s strange! She can seem a bit aloof and watches them and shakes her head watching many children.",46
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,56,When I talk with my daughter she is eloquent and smart and seems very normal. I think it’s many times about autistic people understanding themselves in a world that seems very weird,32
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,57,"Wow, that got quite dark. It's not who I usually am but idk the topic just gets to me",19
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,58,"Our child is amazing, we now know she is autistic because we took an interest in finding out what autism truly was in girls and women. I was very dismissive of her initial cry’s for help because I had no idea what autism was but she did as an 11 year old girl. It’s all about the research daddy 😂 we now understand researching is part of her autism. We live in the uk and the help you can get here is non existent, in fact it’s so backwards you have to fight for any recognition. We are a year and a half into self diagnosing her autism and we have another two years waiting for an official stamp.",119
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,59,Our gp said my daughter can’t be autistic because she looked him in the eyes 😂 we spent many hours teaching her to look at peoples shoulders or just above the head,32
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,60,"The main thing preventing me is my fear of having a traumatic experience with the doctor doing my assessment. I have had very traumatic medical situations before. I will try to work that idea in my mind and see when I feel ready. Because I do want to get an assessment done, I am just scared. Thank you. <3",59
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,61,I 100% agree self diagnosis is valid and it’s nice to hear a medical professional agreeing!,16
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,62,An autism diagnosis via NHS in U.K. got me the following:,11
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,63,"Access to disability support services which is a lovely lady that came and essentially fixed my life (I had debt and calls/letters that needing chasing, she sorted it all),",29
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,64,"Access to PiP which gives me an extra £500 per month none means tested to make life a little easier,",20
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,65,"Access to long term disability benefits if I find myself out of work (don’t need it rn but a lot of ASD end up without work),",26
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,66,"Free and easy access to an NHS dentist (there’s a community care dentist in every major city that you have to be disabled to access),",25
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,67,"Easier access to therapies tailored to ASD and also medications (I’m given argument free diazepam to use when I see fit whereas that’s usually difficult to obtain, I use it sparingly for high anxiety situ),",35
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,68,Priority register with energy companies so if the power goes out I get it back quickly/if works are planned I get advanced notice etc,24
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,69,"You may not need any of that but I think it’s really important that people know that that’s available to them. I honestly need some of that but I think my son is getting the real benefit. He’s 14, diagnosed at 10 and wow, I got him an EHCP (education healthcare plan) with the local council so he gets:",59
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,70,"A placement at a local ASD school with 12 kids per class and 4 teachers (wtf right?!),",17
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,71,"No bullying ever cus his schoolmates are like him and omg did I mention the 12 kids per class?! That place is Hogwarts,",23
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,72,"Access to PiP also which is around £450 per month rn and will increase and be paid to him direct when he turns 16 regardless of income,",27
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,73,"Advanced support on the transition from school to college including an offered placement at an ASD college which has lines of ASD friendly businesses connected waiting to employ them,",29
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,74,"Extensive support when he chooses to join university (the list I saw was crazy, from extra financial aid, free computers and extra time for tests),",25
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,75,Lastly he’ll have the supports I have but getting all this support early really gives him a leg up,19
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,76,"My psychotherapist who I've been with for a few years now alerted me to being autistic recently, and from there everything has fallen into place and it's been a journey of self acceptance to say the least.",37
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,77,"I wanted to get an NHS assessment but the wait is over 18 months and going private costs 2K, but I feel like I am less valid in people's eyes if I don't have an official diagnosis (also imposter syndrome), so I am probably going to fork out the money. It sucks.",52
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,78,"No I didn't silence anything. I routinely paste this link because reddit population is so changing, new people are here every hour, I suspect.",24
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,79,I think it is really important that a major USA uni is taking this stance.,15
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,80,So?,1
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,81,"There was a thread this week about how an autism diagnosis can limit immigration - a lot of ""developed"" countries consider autism a reason to reject your application. I was specifically interested in Australia - apparently they rejected a kid bc of their autism, but gave the rest of the kid's family entry, and it was only bc of international outrage that the kid was accepted. So yeah, any musings about official diagnosis have officially gone out the window for me :')",82
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,82,"There was a post about this a couple of days ago, specifically about New Zealand. I think it was here but I'm not 100% sure. Sorry, I don't feel like fishing for it right now, but yeah, sadly not BS. Certain countries, certain states have these restrictions.",47
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,83,"Yeah weird isn't quite the right word but she told me doctor there was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary in any way about me. Like she couldn't come up with anything at all that might interest him. Which doesn't make sense because she told me plenty of stories of my behavior as a child that seemed out of the ordinary to me. Her favorite thing to describe me as was ""an old soul"" because of how unchildlike I acted, and she did not mention that at all to the doctor.",91
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,84,No of course I’m glad you commented because I didn’t know that was all available! Like at all??? I’m actually in shock!!,22
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,85,I’m well aware that getting diagnosed as early as possible for children is so important as that obviously unlocks support in schools etc so if OP wasn’t already an adult I’d have 100% suggested going for an assessment.,38
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,86,"But in the NHS trust I work for there doesn’t seem to be anything available to those who have level one/mild severity autism. As the NHS diagnosed me it’s just not from the “official” autism psychiatrist, it is on my notes and things so I thought I was basically treated as if I have an official diagnosis as my GP, LMHT, crisis team etc all recognises it. As far as I know professionally and what I have been offered there’s nothing in terms of massive support network or therapy offered which is tailored to ASD. Any clients, both on the wards and in the community with ASD have only been offered CBT which isn’t great for ND people. I applied for PIP and was awarded enhanced rates for ASD despite not having an “official” diagnosis so I have that but other than that I haven’t seen any benefits. My LMHT told me the neurodevelopmental special services in my city offer support once diagnosed but when I spoke to them they told me they do the assessment and discharge you without further support. Unless you have ADHD and they will keep you on through medication titration.",195
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,87,The dentist thing has especially blown my mind! I’m terrified of the dentist and have only had one procedure without full on sedation. I asked both my LMHT and my dentist if there is a service for people with autism and sensory issues to get sedation done quicker/free and I was told there’s nothing! I even posted in the DWP Reddit asking if PIP allows you access to dental surgeries and everyone said not really no.,76
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,88,I’m actually shocked! In work we help people apply for PIP and such and that’s all we suggest other than a referral to adult social care. I guess it really is an NHS/social care lottery.,35
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,89,I’m glad you have got so much out of the diagnosis and it’s allowed you to set up things for your son. I genuinely didn’t think it did much because where I am it really doesn’t seem to!,38
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,90,ETA: I’ve been prescribed diazepam for stressful life events a few times but that was all pre diagnosis. As far as I’m aware and from what my psych said there’s no meds specifically for autism and wouldn’t prescribe anything for my intense anxiety 😟,44
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,91,"I so get you, I do really struggle with imposter syndrome too. I have to regularly look at my clinic letter from my psychology where it says I have “probable autism of mild severity” under my working diagnosis. I’ve just put the deposit down for a private ADHD assessment because although my psychiatrist thinks I have it, as they’re not working for the neurodevelopmental service and they’re controlled drugs he can’t prescribe the medication for me and I didn’t want to wait. So deffo understand your pain. Just remember you’re valid even if one day they assess you and for some reason you don’t get the diagnosis!",107
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,92,Still apply for PIP though with autism as a diagnosis! I was awarded PIP for my autism with just that letter and you could put your psychotherapist down and they can contact them for clarification.,35
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,93,[deleted],1
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,94,"I wouldn’t worry to much about the doctors, from my experience they don’t seem to be to smart. My ex was a gp and a surgeon and she told me never trust the word of a doctor. I think that speaks volumes 😂",43
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,95,"I’m so glad you help people apply for PiP. That thing is life changing and so damn hard to get without a professional to help and validate your claim. I hope you know how appreciated that is, I was nervous about being weird when my nurse hooked me up but I wanted to cry and hug her!",57
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,96,I am wondering if it’s an area/city thing as the area I live in is impoverished but it is an “autism friendly town” in Lancashire,25
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,97,"I’m amazed you can get PiP that’s awesome!! I honestly thought you had to have a concrete diagnosis cus they had me show them our papers when I applied, thank you for that I know a couple of ppl irl that that’s going to help!",45
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,98,The service that diagnosed me (LANC Ltd) basically gave me my papers and said off you pop! Super helpful…,19
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,99,I’ve found a lot of places offered support/concessions without an official diagnosis cus it’s not like they’re going to ask to see your papers so I always tell autistic peeps I know to just say they are if self diagnosed as they’ll still have access. A lot won’t due to imposter syndrome which is awful.,55
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,100,"If you have a community dental practice near you please access it! The one I attend is amazing, they’re trained to deal specifically with disabled people, I see a lot of severe MS sufferers there. I’ve been baby talked through streaming tears and it’s the only way I can get work done now. I wouldn’t have known it existed without my support worker (she’s part of Focus-Care a GP support service aimed at combining medical care with social care, essentially a nurse that’s trained to do a social workers job).",90
z9pjvp,AutismInWomen,101,I get a semi regular prescription of Diazepam but I only claim maybe 10 pills a year? There’s no pills for us but I find SSRI helpful and the pills I’m given for epilepsy are used as mood stabilisers off label and help massively with my anxiety. I was on propranolol for my anxiety initially and it was a wonder drug but my blood pressure is naturally low so it was no good long term.,75

z9pmca,MuslimLounge,0,What is tabarruj?,3
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,1,Just what the title says and I'm referring specifically to women's clothing because I'm a woman.,16
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,2,My specific questions are:,4
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,3,"How much of your arm/ leg do you need to cover, e.g. are three-quarter sleeves ok? Is exposing your feet (as in, by wearing sandals) ok?",26
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,4,Is visible jewellery okay?,4
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,5,"If your face looks prettier than an average person's face, to the point where it can attract attention on its own, is this tabarruj?",24
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,6,"The minimum is that the whole body needs to be covered up, including feet, except for the face/hands (even though there is a difference of opinion about niqab, which I should point out). So three quarter sleeves and showing your feet do not meet the criteria.",46
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,7,">If your face looks prettier than an average person's face, to the point where it can attract attention on its own, is this tabarruj?",24
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,8,Makeup where non-mahram are seeing you would be tabarruj. I was also listening to a talk recently where it was said that even the scholars who hold the opinion that niqab isn't obligatory - they would say it should be worn if there is a fear of fitna. Not sure if that answers your question.,55
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,9,Im pretty sure you need to cover up your arms up until your wrists.,14
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,10,"Sandals are only okay if your garmet covers your feet, if not then socks have to be worn.",18
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,11,Visible jewelry where?,3
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,12,If you’re covering everything that needs to be covered then you’re doing everything correctly. Wear the hijab correctly and dress correctly and Allah will reward you inshallah,27
z9pmca,MuslimLounge,13,And Allah knows best.,4

z9qnvv,MaladaptiveDreaming,1,"I know that a lot of people on this subreddit pace to music in their free time, I do the same. For the past two years I have been pacing everyday whenever I can. I don’t think it’s become a full on addiction but something like it. When I can’t pace for long periods of time I start to get emotional, angry, irrational etc and the same goes for if I can’t find the right",75
z9qnvv,MaladaptiveDreaming,2,"song to pace to. It went from just thinking up random stuff to music in my free time to using every morning, every passing period in school and every night to do this. And I’m stupid for thinking it wouldn’t have any consequences. Not only have I been pacing everyday for two years but I’ve also had my volume at full for almost every time. I’ve been starting to notice the insides of my ears hurting out of nowhere, I need to ask friends to repeat themselves at least 10 times, sometimes there’s ringing, stuff like that. I’ve been trying my best to pace to music at a lower volume but it’s so hard when you’ve been unconsciously been doing this for years. I’m scared. I’m still a teenager, I love music more than anything. I can’t lose my hearing and I don’t know what to do.",147
z9qnvv,MaladaptiveDreaming,3,"Go to a doctor, immediately! Maybe it's just an earwax buildup or something like that. and even if it's a hear loss, it's better to know it so you know your options",32
z9qnvv,MaladaptiveDreaming,4,same especially when I smoke need to feel it in my veins fr,13
z9qnvv,MaladaptiveDreaming,5,"The same thing happens to me. The problem is that I have a slight hearing loss since I was little and, since I started daydreaming, I couldn't stop putting my headphones on withthe music at maximum volume and that is very dangerous for me. I haven't lost more hearing, but I started to hear a ringing in my ear that I think is tinnitus. It has been very hard for me, but every time I try to resist and turn down the volume of the music, but sometimes I put the music at maximus volume again, but now it doesn't happen that much. I have the same fear you have because I'm also a teenager and I love music and I can't live without it. I don't know what advice I could give you, but I sometimes try to hide my headphones to avoid picking them up, but I know it's really hard. Also I think other thing that helped me was watching the movie Sound of Metal which made me realize that I had to stop doing that.",179
z9qnvv,MaladaptiveDreaming,6,"Thanks, I’m definitely gonna let my doctor know next time I have a checkup",14
z9qnvv,MaladaptiveDreaming,7,Thanks for the advice. I’ll consider hiding my headphones if it comes down to it.,15

I recently stopped smoking and everytime someone walks by smoking makes me not wanting go back ever. Doesn’t smell like the weed I remember before it went legal doesn’t smell right smells off. And everywhere I go everyone smoking has that same scent of burnt rubber. I looked it up and they that smell is neem oil that is used to kill mites when there is an infestation. I’ve been smoking for 15 years and never smelled this before a lot of the weed downs not smoke heavy very light smoke when you take a draw also it hard to find real quality a lot of garbage over rated stuff coming from the government I’ve tried all the company’s all the oz all the eights all the quarters.I remember an old man telling me to watch out with the weed once the government takes over there never in the business of bettering people just destroying them. I remember seeing a documentary where they took bunch different weed to the laboratory to check for thc and cbd percentage. They said that cbd is naturally occuring in marijuana to counter balanxce the schizophrenia that weed causes the test came back with 0% cbd on all the buds. Meaning that it was purposely taken out… WATCH OUT FOR THE BULLSHIT EVERYTHING IS FAKE NOW A DAYS,248

I've gone 3 straight on fraser valley donny b. I'd recommend that one for sure. My next step is to try psf. Most likely sugar cookies but maybe bubble mints. I'm a big fan of island cherry by SEV7N. Apparently redecan has stepped up their game. I grabbed tweeds kush mints and they've stepped up as well. Theres also a new company (or one I havent heard of) called well made with 2 new ozs.

There are many illegal operations that put as much care and attention to detail into their bud as high end legal brands do. And then of course there’s absolute garbage chads lol. But I’d rather order from a high end chad then smoke PSF any day. I understand some people are willing to compromise on quality and value by settling for the low-end legal offerings because it feels safer to them, but to a lot of seasoned smokers that stuff just doesn’t cut it.",111

z9qput,TheOCS,191,Not any legal option. But any affordable Oz option yea. I’ll still buy some cheap legal ounces just for convenience and consistency. It is nice to just go to the store and know exactly what I’m getting. But I do feel the legal market is just sort of weak in the budget oz sector. And did you smoke weed pre-legalization? Every experienced grower was a “fuckin criminal” at some point haha. There is good clean weed out there.,78
z9qput,TheOCS,192,"You’re putting “decent, reputable, LP’s” and Pure Sunfarms in the same category? Shows how little you know… Bought their stuff 3 times and was moldy twice, it was comparable to a $10 oz I bought in Mexico",37

I will be an international student there.",60
z9r0t0,gradadmissions,2,"I can't speak to your discipline, but I can say that in the Australian job market you're not really going to be competing against Ivy League graduates often because the ivy league doesn't exist here. I think in general we care a lot less about University rankings. I'm not saying it doesn't matter at all, just that it doesn't matter that much. I think in general both in and out of Australia, people are more interested in the work you've done. If you have good work and good publications nobody will carr about your institution, and after your first job they'll care even less. Also Swinburne isn't bad. And Melbourne is a great city. And those funded positions are competitive so it's an achievement in and of itself to get that. If you like the course, the professor, and the city, I really really wouldn't stress about the prestige.",149

Has anyone gone through this? Also, any advice on how to get the letter we have been calling the VA but no one is picking up.",60
z9r5s0,Veterans,2,Get a different bank if they don't understand where military retirement pay comes from.,14
z9r5s0,Veterans,3,"Further, DFAS doesn't even know what her retired pay will be yet because those calculations are done after separation. you can kind of do the math yourself and ballpark it based off her draft DD-214 but you won't the final answer until she either gets her first ERAS or the payment hits the bank. That is the ay it worked when I retired. I want to say DFAS has up to 60 days to start paying you. The final month's AD pay is held pending the final audit from DFAS, mine was released 45 days after my retirement date. In my case I got my retirement check the following month but I know guys who did not.",117
z9r5s0,Veterans,4,"Might be some confusion on this. I believe the letter they are asking for is to see if you need to pay the funding fee or not. My bank didn't ask for this when I was retiring, with a pending disability claim, and I had to pay the funding fee. A VSO might be able to help get this letter. It should only state that you have a pending claim, and are expected to get 10% or more. This only applies if you are closing after your date of separation, not if you are closing while on active duty, because your date of disability will be after your separation date.",110
z9r5s0,Veterans,5,"If they are asking for this to get a loan approval they are wrong, this is only used for closing costs(funding fee).",22

z9r5s0,Veterans,8,Get a different bank that actually knows what they are doing.,11
z9r5s0,Veterans,9,The bank wouldn't use my future (retiring in 1 month) retirement pay as it had not happened yet. We had to find another way. Total shit,26
z9r5s0,Veterans,10,Why does the bank need to know she is retiring? Not what you asked but have you considered calling a mortgage broker (one who works with many banks) for a better rate/deal?,32
z9r5s0,Veterans,11,The bank wants proof of income. Pretty common issue with military retiring.,12
z9r5s0,Veterans,12,Yeah I can understand that but what if the member is not gonna retire? Like say they got 19 years and they wanna stay until 26-30 years.,27
z9r5s0,Veterans,13,Not to mention its not a secret how military retirement is calculated.,12
z9r5s0,Veterans,14,"I guess I'm not surprised, banks have definitely learned from the housing crisis 15 years ago.",16

z9rse5,diabetes,0,From 8.4 to 5.8 A1c,5
z9rse5,diabetes,1,I was diagnosed 2 months with A1c 8.4 now now is down to 5.8 . Without any medication I just did keto . Big achievement. There is a hope.,29
z9rse5,diabetes,2,Pretty good progress!,3
z9rse5,diabetes,3,"As I'll note to others, it's possible for some people to achieve positive results with lifestyle changes, but not everyone can do this. Additionally, make sure your changes are sustainable. Diabetes is a marathon that never ends, and burnout is real, which can lead to regression. If you feel you can keep up the intensity of keto, then by all means, go for it because it appears to be working for you.",72
z9rse5,diabetes,4,Good luck!,2
z9rse5,diabetes,5,Very nice! And very quick! We went low carb over a year ago and were heavier keto with our diet the first 2 or 3 months - it was working great too! But then we saw one of Dr. Richard K. Bernstein's videos where he does finger wagging saying to make sure a person gets enough protein! So we listened and upped our protein - but will still use a lot of keto recipes. Here in this more recent video he does some more finger-wagging about protein at 18:30 of '[19 Facts your Doctor May Not Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHLFP71Oi3Y&t=679s)'. With his nearly unbeatable experience we figured we ought to listen. We mention Dr. Bernstein along with many others in this [message board thread](https://ihatedialysis.com/forum/index.php?topic=35473.0).,121
z9rse5,diabetes,6,Looks like you caught it early! Always best when that happens. Congrats!,12
z9rse5,diabetes,7,Nice Work!!,2
z9rse5,diabetes,8,Great job! You’re going down the right path!🥳,8
z9rse5,diabetes,9,It is doable I went from 9 down to 5.4 within a year after my diagnosis and kept it around that for a while before becoming pregnant. I was able to maintain those readings through keto and weight loss but it’s a lot to keep up with on a long term aspect. after delivery I may consider at least meal time insulin because I will say pregnancy has allowed me some freedom within my diet that I missed,78
z9rse5,diabetes,10,You did well on your self discipline. And it really takes self discipline to stop T2 from becoming progressive. You are already a step ahead of most. Keep Going !,30
z9rse5,diabetes,11,&#x200B;,1
z9rse5,diabetes,12,"High insulin during a lifetime is one of the biggest causes of insulin resistance. Continuing to shoot insulin makes type 2 a progressive disease. Using an insulin pusher (a drug that makes the pancreas produce more insulin) does the same thing. Just stop eating carbohydrates and watch your BG fall. I can say this from experience. I was diagnosed 20 years ago and took the advice of physicians with whom I worked. They all told be the same thing, ""Stop eating carbohydrates. But, I am not your physician and did not tell you this"". 20 years later I am still on an extremely low carb diet. I eat about 20 grams per day. I started this diet journey by stopping all carbohydrates. I went through withdrawal for 3 days. It felt awful. After 3 days it was like a miracle. I felt better than I had in so many years. It was like I had 20 years taken off my age. I felt so good that it was a long time before I would even eat anything green. You need to drink 100 oz of water per day.",188
z9rse5,diabetes,13,I highly recommend Metformin to help with your journey. I prefer the ER version. It is cheap and has proven itself over the decades. Metformin does not allow you to go ahead and eat carby stuff that is bad for you. It just helps perhaps with most people by knocking off 10 points from your BG meter.,57
z9rse5,diabetes,14,"Use your meter often! believe your meter. If you want to know how a food affects your BG, you need to eat a portion that you would normally eat and then measure every 15 minutes for 2 to 3 hours. You need to detect the spike. Spikes count. Any reading over 140 begins irreversible cellular damage. Taking your BG 2 or 3 hours after you eat does not tell you what you need to know in order to stay healthy and expect the same lifespan as a non-diabetic.",88
z9rse5,diabetes,15,"Continuing to eat carbohydrates and covering it with insulin or a pusher, will eventually cause serious complications and effect your quality of life in a seriously negative way.",28
z9rse5,diabetes,16,Taking this advice will demand serious change. Most of us hate change. I hate change.,15

unknown,unknown,2,Just remember your a1c is not a grade. It’s meant to inform you if what you’re doing is working. A small increase probably isn’t anything to worry about. Subsequent results showing an up trend or larger increases tell you something isn’t working and it’s time for adjustments.,47

z9s7fj,Sparkdriver,0,New Driver Question,3
z9s7fj,Sparkdriver,1,"I am fairly new to spark and have a question for those who have been doing this for a while... Orders with multiple deliveries, what is your process? I drive a Toyota Prius. I recently had two orders and the loader asked which order I wanted in my trunk, one was a small order the other a medium. When I told him both, he questioned me as to how I would know which was for each order. Told him the smaller order was to go in my vmcatering bag and the bigger one out if the bag. (I was planning on packing the other order in bigger bags to make delivery easier, just wasn't trying to hold up the loader). But, it got me thinking if I was to take one of the orders that have 9-12 deliveries, even though most were one or two items, the sticker would be on that single bag, but there were some that obviously would be multiple bags. I feel slowing the loader down while I pack in seperate ""delivery"" bags is not the right thing to do... Do you all use those multiple compartment trunk dividers? Any help would be greatly appreciated.",199
z9s7fj,Sparkdriver,2,Very simple. With grocery orders one in the trunk and one in the back seat as per TOS you agreed too.,21
z9s7fj,Sparkdriver,3,"If they are dotcom orders, each one will have its own sticker. Food and other general merchandise are usually in bags with one sticker per order going with you. It's much easier to keep them separated (one in the truck and one inside the car) just to be on the safe side.",52

unknown,unknown,3,For the grocery orders I have stuff in the trunk I don’t wanna mess with I put the small one passenger and the other in the backseat. Try to separate it that makes it easier.,35
unknown,unknown,4,"I drive a Prius too, and always have my seat down to make a bigger loading area. I always put the smaller order into large insulated bags and the bigger order into ikea bags. None of the loaders have had an issue with this, so far. I can see they mark one order for the trunk and one for back seat on there end even though I don’t technically have a back seat.",73
unknown,unknown,5,"For the dotcom orders, if I have more than six or eight orders I actually alphabetize them in my trunk/cargo area after the loader has finished. Makes it super easy to grab the one I want and if somebody has multiple packages they will be together so I won't have to hunt for them.",54
unknown,unknown,6,"As far as the crap in your backseat, you need to take it out when you're sparking. The loaders have good reason to not want to put other people's groceries in with your stuff, because of hygiene concerns and also because they don't want it getting lost in the shuffle. All my personal stuff goes in the front passenger seat.",60
unknown,unknown,7,"Thank you. My back seat I had a carseat and all my ""delivery""/reusable grocery bags that I normally keep in my trunk but wanted out of the way for the orders. I did that because I had read on another post how a loader complained about stuff being the a drivers trunk, even though it was nothing more than like a crate of necessities in a car- jumper cables, etc. So because of that, I didn't think putting an order in the back seat would be ""approved"" with my personal items there. But I appreciate your info, thank you. It helps.",101
unknown,unknown,8,"Ok, That makes sense, I have seen some white with yellow packaging that resembled the Amazon gray plastic bags. I am assuming that is what you mean as packed like Amazon. Then each on of those packages has its own sticker even if you have multiple ones going to the same address? This makes more sense in my head now. I had been scared of accepting any and worrying how it would fit in the car, had one that looked like the description was a 32"" TV as well.",89
unknown,unknown,9,"Thank you for the advice, love the alphabetical idea.",9
unknown,unknown,10,"My personal stuff, other than my grandson's carseat, is reusable insulated bags that I use for not only my own grocery shopping when I am out as I live 30-40 mins from Walmart, but I also use them to help carry deliveries in with, reduces the hand fatigue and chances of the thin crap walmart bags (our area does not have the thicker plastic bag like Target has) breaking while trying to deliver. I have 9 or 10, they normally fit behind my seat on the floor. Other than that, I have two blankets that sit in my grandson's seat when I am delivering, vs in the trunk for emergencies and a rain jacket, cause you never know.",118
unknown,unknown,11,"Yes, the white and yellow poly mailers packages are what we call DotCom orders.

z9tvve,ECEProfessionals,0,So sick all the time.,5
z9tvve,ECEProfessionals,1,"I JUST started this job at a daycare. I'm a floater/assistant I've been working with the babies and it seems that this is the season for everyone to be sick. The problem is, I'm also getting sick. Ive only been there for three weeks and each week I've actually caught what the babies had. First two weeks I had a fever for a few days and now I've caught the stomach bug. I havent stopped throwing up for two days and could barely see straight. I've finally caught my breath for a moment and it has me thinking a lot.",100
z9tvve,ECEProfessionals,2,"Is this job even worth it? I love the babies dearly already and my coworkers think I'm a great team player. I just can't believe I've been this sick already and I feel so freaking guilty not being there. They're understanding but how understanding are they going to be? I just want some second opinions. Is it worth waiting for my immune system to toughen up? I'm thinking I should just quit at this point, I can't keep getting sick and I can't keep calling out and leaving people hanging.",90
z9tvve,ECEProfessionals,3,"So, I think it's a misconception/myth that your ""immune system gets stronger"" the more you work with children. While it's true that your body will develop antibodies whenever it's exposed to a virus (like the cold or flu), there are hundreds upon hundreds of viruses that effect humans, that the likelihood of becoming immune to all of them is low. And everyone's immune response is going to be different -- if you're immune compromised, being exposed to more viruses can actually be harmful.",83
z9tvve,ECEProfessionals,4,"To answer your question -- I don't know. But from my experience, you don't stop getting sick. Some viruses may be less intense than others, but after 13+ years, I'm still getting sick. The only thing that has prevented illness is wearing a mask for me. So after 4 different bouts of illness this school year, I've put my mask back on so that I can enjoy the holidays with my family.",72

z9tvve,ECEProfessionals,8,How's the culture around masking where you work? I've gone back to wearing them after getting really sick for the first time in a couple years. I'll probably wear it for cold and flu season then drop them again when things get better.,43
z9tvve,ECEProfessionals,9,"I also found the younger the kids I work with the more often I get sick. Babies are literally on you all the time, not to mention having to wipe their noses all day.

z9tvve,ECEProfessionals,13,"I literally came back to this sub just to see if anyone else was struggling with this. I am sick again for the fifth or sixth time within the span of like two months and it’s EXHAUSTING. The fact that if you were to take time off every time you got sick, you’d barely be there, makes it some much more frustrating. It’s like you have to wait until you’re actually incapable of functioning to take a single day off. I adore the kids i work with too so I don’t think I could bring myself to leave, but every time I feel that sore throat coming on, I definitely rethink it for a minute.",115

z9uu7z,AITAH,1,"(names changed just incase) I (M17) was friends with a rachel (F17) for 4 and a half years. Me and Rachel were best friends since we started secondary school together. We constantly were on facetime, hung out near to every day and NEVER had a falling out.",47
z9uu7z,AITAH,2,"In october 2021 Rachel met her boyfriend i will be calling Kyle (m17). Kyle never liked me very much but we still managed to be civil and would speak on nights out. In november 2021 Rachel sent a picture to Kyle of me slapping her ass. I would like to preference this by saying i am gay and she told me to do it as it would be funny. After this we got dressed and went to a party not checking our phones. At the end of the night we both checked our phones to see Kyle had text both of us giving out and being quite agressive, Rachel crying and me, being drunk, sent him a voice message explaining i don’t understand why he is so angry at us seeing as i’m gay and have been friends with Rachel for 4 years and have always done stupid stuff like this and have never had any relationship (even before coming out). Kyle finally calmed down a few weeks later and it was all ok again.",175
z9uu7z,AITAH,3,"This past March me, Kyle and Rachel went to a bar with a few of our friends for drinks. The night went well and no drama happened the whole night. As i was leaving i hugged Rachel goodbye and left with Kyle and a few of our mutual friends to go home. Kyle never said anything to me and it all seemed ok. the next morning i woke up to being given out to by both Kyle And Rachel for trying to get in between them. i obviously confused said i didn’t no what they ment yet they both blocked me and he was threatening to beat me up",109
z9uu7z,AITAH,4,me and Rachel stopped talking for a few months and i was devestated because i lost my best friend.,19
z9uu7z,AITAH,5,2 months ago Kyle and Rachel broke up. She rang me crying over it and i cheered her up. Later that day while hanging out with friends i saw that Rachel had added me on snapchat and we started talking as we used to.,44
z9uu7z,AITAH,6,4 days later Rachel and Kyle got back together but Rachel promised she would tell Kyle to be nice to me and we will continue to be friends.,28
z9uu7z,AITAH,7,"last week i saw that Rachel had blocked me on snapchat for no apparent reason. i confronted her about it and she said her phone must have glitched. she added me back but about 2 hours later she had blocked me again. The next day at school i asked her again if it was Kyles fault i was blocked again and she immediately got defensive, she said the reason she blocked me is because i was annoying and a bitch. this set me off and i blew up at her for still",92

z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,0,Is it normal to not have a goal weight?,9
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,1,"Just as the title reads... Answering questions in my psych packet and one question asked my goal weight. The more I've thought about it, I don't have one. I've never looked at getting this surgery to reach a goal weight, I have a ton of NSVs I can't wait to check off, but reaching a certain weight isn't one of them. Is this normal? The more I think about it, the more it's bothering me. Everyone on here seems so excited to reach onederland, should I be looking forward to that? If I don't have a goal weight and honestly tell that to my psychologist, will that be a reason to not approve me or something? Should I put a number and just keep my NSV list to myself?",129
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,2,"I just want to feel better about myself. Put on jeans that fit (everywhere)... Go bike riding with my son. Overall, I want to teach him better food and exercise habits. I know these are good things, but it's okay for these to be my goals, right? Not, just a number...?",51
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,3,I sure hope it’s normal because I definitely don’t have a number in mind.,14
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,4,"My thought is that I’m going to do what I can to take care of myself as best I can. I’m going to lose weight in that process, but I have no idea how much or when that weight will come off. In fact, it’s impossible for any of us to know.",52
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,5,I think what they’re looking for on some form is that your number is realistic. Do you weigh 293 pounds and want to get down to 95? That’s probably not realistic or healthy.,33
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,6,"My goal weight is fitting on a rollercoaster. I don’t have a weight in mind, but my ideal size is a size 12/14. But I’d be happy at a 16 as well. I have large hips that I want to keep.",41
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,7,I only have a number goal because there is a weight limit to sky diving,15
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,8,"I'm kind of in the same boat. If I can get under 300, I'll be thrilled. But a number isn't really what I'm shooting for. I want to be able to fly on a plane without a seatbelt extender. I want to be able to shop for clothes somewhere other than the Big & Tall stores. I want to be able to climb more than two flights of stairs without needing to stop for breath. I guess the goal weight is just more of a concrete victory to strive for, but all the other little things are going to mean far more to me as they happen.",107
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,9,"I never had a goal weight either and really believe that is the healthier approach. I have a lot of things I want to do to enjoy the full capabilities of my body that only weightloss will provide, but saying I want to weigh 120 and be a size 4 is not an approach that I am willing to take.",60
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,10,I think you should have a preliminary goal (like losing 70% of excess weight) but I don’t think anyone can have a final goal because most of us have no idea what it would be because we’ve been so far away for most or all of our adult lives. My preliminary goal is to lose the excess then I’ll reassess. I want to get to a lifestyle that has balance and isn’t all or nothing.,75
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,11,I hope it's normal because I don't either lol.,9
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,12,"I was 200 lbs at 10 years old, so I don't know what adult me is supposed to weigh or what is realistic.",23
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,13,"I agree with everyone else, I think it's more about having a healthy goal.",14
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,14,I loved going based on NSV as opposed to an overall end goal. I also don’t have a number and my surgeon didn’t either. He cares about my overall health. I am almost 2 years post op and at my 18 month Check up he said to match the BMI range I’d have to lose 20 more pounds but he doesn’t care about that. He is so happy with my progress and now wants me focusing on building muscle for better overall health. So I have no actual stated goal weight from my surgeon and I have never really cared about one. I started this journey at 314+ pounds and am hovering around 175 right now so I’m just pleased overall! I love not having a goal weight.,128
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,15,"My surgeon asked me what my goal weight was, on my 1 year anniversary. I straight up told him I don't want to be defined by a number. I can walk without a cane, do stuff without being out of breath. That is my goal.",45
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,16,Plus I really hate buying clothes lol.,7
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,17,Eh I don’t have a hard number. I had a loose one where I hit milestones with each birth/pregnancy of my kids. So far I’m down to birth of 2nd kid. Still need to work down to 1st kid. If I get that far maybe weight at enlistment?,48
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,18,"The only numerical goal I have is to get into the 100's again, but I don't have a goal weight. I think wanting to be and live healthy, and feel better, is a good enough goal.",36
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,19,"I don't have a weight goal. A few years ago I managed to lose 50 lbs. Played the best golf of my life that summer, then gained it back.",29
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,20,"I want to be able to walk 18 with my son with no foot, knee or back pain and maybe even be able to beat him on occasion.",28
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,21,I think you have a very healthy perspective.,8
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,22,"My consultant asked me if I had any more questions and then said oh you should loose about 85kg, most people ask that question, I didn't know hiw much that was ( from UK and use stones and lbs) but smiled and said great",44
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,23,I never wrote down or spoke a goal weight because I mentally did not want to put pressure on myself or end up feeling failure if I did not get there. I know there is a weight above an ideal weight that I would be comfortable and healthier at. Would I like to get to my ideal weight sure but I focused more on following a healthier eating and lifestyle and let the results be what they are. I had also read that on average people lose a percentage of their “excess” weight. Something like 75 percent. But anyway the inverse of that is that people still keep a percentage of their excess weight so I didn’t want to create an unrealistic scenario that would trigger me to feel as though I failed,133
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,24,Also don't have one but a ton of different goals.,10
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,25,I don’t have an end goal… I have “little” goals along the way… I’m down 160 lbs and about 10 lbs away from actually being what my driver’s license says I weight… that was a goal for me. I also want to weigh less than my husband (about 50 lbs away right now). But my next dr visit I plan on asking what a realistic goal weight for me will be because I know I’m gonna have a lot of excess skin weight.,83
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,26,"I don’t have a goal weight. My goals are to bring my blood sugar levels down, I’m a type 2 diabetic, and just overall have a more healthy body.",29
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,27,"My take on that question (goal weight) is that they want to be sure your aim isn’t unreasonable. Imagine putting down a number so low that, for an person who’s never dealt with weight issues, would be difficult to achieve. I think it’s fair to say “I’d expect to feel comfortable in my body at X weight, but what my real goal is to ride a bike without my joints hurting, be able to play with my kids without being too out of breadth, etc.” As everyone alludes to - it’s a major mental challenge, so you’re head has to be in a reasonable space.",105
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,28,"I don't have a goal weight and never have. Told my surgeon, my nutritionist, my psychologist, everyone, and they were all fine with it.",24
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,29,"It's pretty simple, find the weight that puts you in the healthy BMI range ..there's the goal.",17
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,30,For sure normal! I didn’t have one at first I just wanted to feel better and fit in clothes I liked. Then I got under 200 and was like hey 170 sounds like a good place cause it’s a “normal” BMI weight for my height. Now I’m under 170 and I’m like hey 150 would be cool! Who knows if I’ll have a new one at 150 when I get there. Just going with the flow and what feels good for my body.,83
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,31,"I think it can also be discouraging in the beginning to have a “goal” cause it seems so far away, hundreds of pounds away and before surgery that made me feel like I’ll never get there so why even try.",40
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,32,"I don’t have a goal weight either, but if I can get down close to 200lbs I’ll be happy. My “healthy” weight is supposed to be 134 and I don’t think that’s realistic for me, so my dad and I agree that we hope I can get down to 200 at least. Doctor never mentioned a goal weight for me though",61
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,33,"I never really had a goal weight, but a goal range. I am now in that range and just work maintaining that 3-5 pound range.",25
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,34,So if they need a definitive answer look up the weight for the ideal bike u want to ride or the weight of a typical person who wears whatever size jeans u want to get into?,36
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,35,"Yeah the scale number is not everything. BMI is also not really a good indicator, especially if you are also building muscle. I don’t have a weight goal, but more of a weight “range” because I know that I’m building muscle in the process and muscle weighs more than fat. Someone could look really fit and have muscle on them and the bmi calculator will tell them that they’re overweight lol. Body fat percentage is probably a better measure…",79
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,36,"My goal weight is to get down to wearing 2XL shirts again, don't know what number that'll be for me.",20
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,37,"I don’t have a goal weight, either. I think I’ll know it when I get there n",17
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,38,"Echoing other responses. I just kind of guessed based on what I think I may have weighed at a reasonable place in history. I emphasized to my surgeon I was more interested in certain activities, not a weight. I care more about body composition than scale. Guess those were acceptable answers! Haha",52
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,39,Good luck! :),3
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,40,"Is it normal… absolutely. Everyone should have a goal but it’s not necessary. Your doctor/surgen/ primary provider can set one for you but it’s up to you to decide whether it works for you or you go beyond that. Either way, trust the process and you will be successful",49
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,41,I just said 154 because that’s the weight that put me at “normal” bmi. I just want to be healthy and able to do stuff with my family. 50 pounds down at 216 and I’m getting there.,37
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,42,My goal weight is seeing my collarbones :),8
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,43,"i have a goal. at the start of the program i was 296. lb my heaviest ever. i gained more weight after my pregnancy but my pregnancy i didnt get the natural labor i wanted. i had to be induced. induction was horrible. had to get epidural just to rest. (labor took 2 days) and my daughter got stuck twice. pushing took 3 hours but i got her out. either way i started having hypertension just at 5 months of pregnancy and had alot of swelling(preclamcia runs in my family). my ashma got worse. back got worse and my knee injuries got worse. after having my daughter i gained more weight and tipped at 296. it was a wake up call for me. when i saw the doctor i was 286. goal weight for surgery was 271. made it. had surgery oct. 19 2022. now im 232. what pushed me to have this surgery was that i wanted to be a better me, for myself, my husband, and my daughter. i want to be at a healthy bmi so i can live longer since i already have health issues, i also want to have a healthy pregnancy when it comes time for the 2nd baby. :) i have multiple goals, first goal is to get under 200lb. i would be thrilled. 2nd goal is healthy bmi which is 150-160lb. if you dont have a goal in mind thats fine, just strive to be a better and healthier you :)",249
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,44,I didn't have a goal weight.,6
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,45,"Honestly, I thought this surgery would be just another thing that didn't work for me, so even if I put in the work (and I did do the work) - I just didn't want to be let down when the weight didn't drop like everything else I had tried.",49
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,46,I've been pleasantly surprise and have lost over 100 lbs 9 months out.,13

z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,49,I think what they’re looking for on some form is that your number is realistic. Do you weigh 293 pounds and want to get down to 95? That’s probably not realistic or healthy.,33

z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,55,Same.,1
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,56,I want this weight loss journey to be 100% diff than all others I’ve been down before.,17
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,57,I’m not going to weigh for 40 days.,8
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,58,Working with a therapist and dietician to change my thought patterns around weight and numbers etc.,16
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,59,Best of luck to us all.,6
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,60,"That's my thoughts now! I am looking at a healthy weight based on my height, and I just can't imagine being that little! Hell, I don't think I've ever been that small. I'm pretty sure I just sailed right over that healthy range into being over.",46
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,61,I'm in this boat. Overweight my entire life. No specific goal in my head. It just seems unrealistic,18
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,62,Thank you. It's hard to imagine reaching other goals I've set for myself.,13
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,63,I love this. Reading the goal weight for my height feels almost unreal!,13
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,64,"I know, I'm excited to for into jeans comfortably, but that definitely doesn't mean I'll enjoy going to buy them lol",21
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,65,"That's a great way to look at it. I'd love to be what I was before I had my son... you know, back when I thought I was sooo fat. 🙄",31
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,66,"I like how you said that, just a general goal number range. I think I might put something like that! I'm scouring over what is considered a healthy 5 based on my height. Tbh, they so sound so little. I can't imagine ever being that tiny!",46
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,67,"My main diving force is to spend more quality active time with my son. I can't wait to feel good while doing activities with him, again.",26
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,68,"Thank you! More often than not, I see number weight posts on here, and I'm truly excited for others, but when asked directly about mine... I panicked.",27
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,69,"Other than telling me I can't gain weight while in the program, numbers haven't really been discussed with my doctor.",20
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,70,"Wow. That's really deep, fam. Never would've thought as it being that way, either. I would definitely be in the group to label myself as a failure, if I didn't reach the goal.",33
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,71,Have you had your surgery yet?,6
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,72,Even while reading all these it never occurred to me to ask my doctor.. duh!,15
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,73,That's it! I just want to be healthy.,8

z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,82,"I feel like this is me! I have so many little things that I think I'll notice, I'm hoping I just reach a point where I'm just not tired.",29

z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,88,"Congratulations on your 100lbs! Dropping that much will put me in my healthy BMI range, and that would be amazing!",20
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,89,You’re welcome! I remember the last time I went to the amusement park and gave up after the 5th ride I couldn’t fit on. I used to go at least 5-6 times a year. I haven’t been since and it’s been 15 years.,43
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,90,"Same, I was always to heavy. Now it’s a goal!",10
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,91,"Yeah it’s absolutely insane, and impossible unless we are like skin and bones! I’m very happy where I am and I know once I get my skin removal (I have a ton from my previous apron belly) I will see a movement on the scale but I don’t really care about that.",52
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,92,Haha yes!,2
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,93,"No, next Thursday! :D",4
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,94,"I didn't mean that comment to say that HAS to be your goal, i just meant when psych and docs ask, that's a good number to give.",27
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,95,Girl! I feel u on that!!!! Without having a huge Fupa to cover or a severe muffin top! We got this love!!!!!!,22
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,96,Waiting is always the hardest part,6
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,97,Plz share once u ride ur first ride!!! I’m excited for this to happen for u!!,16
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,98,"Oh, goodness! Good luck! Did you have to do the psych consult, too?",13
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,99,"Oh, I know! I really hadn't thought about looking at a healthy BMI to put a number down until it was suggested. Then, when I did, I was a little freaked out. I know it's the ""healthy"" range, and being totally healthy is my goal, but those numbers just seemed low. I picked the higher end of my healthy range and used that number! My healthy range begins at 98lbs, and well, that kind of number NEVER crossed my mind.",80
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,100,Thank you! ❤️,3
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,101,"It’ll be awhile, but I’m hoping maybe (Six Flags Chicago) Fright Fest 2023. Maybe not the Raging Bull, because my hips are big, but my first love, Batman the Ride. If not Fright Fest, I’ll definitely be ready for summer 2024. Maybe even by then I’ll have had my apron removal.",51
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,102,"Yes multiple.consults, it was a drag but I understand it's needed. It took me a year to get to the surgery date",22
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,103,Holy shit that is low!,5
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,104,A year? I'm going to be devastated if it takes that long!,12
z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,105,Yeah I was kind of blown away,7

z9v5w4,gastricsleeve,107,"Kentucky, in the US. I just have to be cleared with an EGD, cardiologist, and psych. Unfortunately, all those appointments are so backlogged that it can take a long time.",30

z9vu5x,Harley,0,Looking to purchase a low rider S the beginning of next year. Looking for a 2019-2022. With a 750 credit score what are the payments looking like ? Thanks I’m advanced !!,32
z9vu5x,Harley,1,nan,1
z9vu5x,Harley,2,Interests rates are high. 5% is considered a good rate. Check around at banks and credit unions before going in to a dealer.,23
z9vu5x,Harley,3,Go to a credit union and ask for an auto loan. Then look around for a bike private sale. You’ll save money overall and some might still have the factory warranty. And you’ll know your interest rate while you’re shopping around.,41
z9vugm,UnitedMasters,0,Why is this this difficult,5
z9vugm,UnitedMasters,1,"I feel like we all ask ourselves this question in the daily if we’re a musician but fr, why oh why, is it this difficult to find a music distribution company that lets you choose a release date and the company actually releases the music on that day, not a day early, not a day late. ???",57
z9vugm,UnitedMasters,2,"I don’t understand why this is so difficult but it’s f’d up for the artists to the nth degree! We get paid $200 for 20k streams for God’s sake..we need to be able to promote our release date for our song and then have it up on the platforms that very day, not early, not late! I am currently with UnitedMasters but am going to switch because of this issue among other issues. But when I was looking this up, I can’t seem to find anyone saying that any certain one will reliably distribute on time. I get things like “tunecore typically releases in 3-5 days” etc.",107
z9vugm,UnitedMasters,3,"I need one with better customer service than UnitedMasters, and comes through for me on release day reliably!! I’m also quite broke so it can’t be expensive really. Like no more than $100/yr. Help! Am I looking for something that doesn’t exist? If so, how do you promote an upcoming single when you don’t know the date it will for sure be available? Thank you! Any advice would be greatly appreciated❤️",71
z9w4em,Skincare_Addiction,0,Maturation Arrest Acne in pregnancy,5
z9w4em,Skincare_Addiction,1,I have had maturation arrest acne for about 15 years now. I was seeing progress at the beginning of the year using CeraVe foaming cleanser and PM lotion day and night and using Glycolic Acid 7% every other night. I've had to stop using glycolic acid because of pregnancy and now my skin is as bad as ever. Any suggestions for getting maturation arrest under control with pregnancy safe products?,70
z9w4em,Skincare_Addiction,2,"Hi there! I’m so sorry to hear this is happening. Maturation arrest is such an annoyance. I had it start after I got clear of cystic acne during my pregnancy, when I was post-partum it developed and I’ve been trying to deal with it since. Face reality products helped me a lot with both, if you have access to an esthetician I would recommend seeing one for it as it is incredibly stubborn. I actually think my esthetician incorrectly increased the intensity of my products, when often maturation can be the result of the wrong products.",96
z9w4em,Skincare_Addiction,3,"I use an app called “acne safe” to check the ingredients of all my products, so for your current routine I would check them out to make sure there is nothing comedogenic. During your pregnancy incorporating some mandelic acid or benzoyl peroxide might help if it is severe. At this point I only use a salicylic toner and occasional retinol or benzoyl peroxide, I found that with the right hydrating products and exfoliating a few times a week my skin responded better than when using actives several times a day.",90
z9w4em,Skincare_Addiction,4,Paula’s choice also has some good products that shouldn’t make the maturation worse. Good luck and congratulations on your pregnancy 🤎,21
z9w6l8,classicalmusic,0,Recommendations based on Handels Messiah,5
z9w6l8,classicalmusic,1,I’ve recently delved into the world of classical music as my in laws play it a lot to my new born baby. His overwhelming favourite seems to be Handels Messiah. So I’m hoping there are similar pieces I can explore as I’d like to listen to some other similar pieces.,50
z9w6l8,classicalmusic,2,Specifically I’m listening to this album on Spotify:,8
unknown,unknown,0,Listen to Israel in Egypt! It’s just as good!,9
unknown,unknown,1,"--Try some of Handel's other oratorios, like *Israel in Egypt,* *Solomon,* *Saul,* and *Theodora*",14
unknown,unknown,2,--Bach's *Mass in B Minor* and *Magnificat*,7
unknown,unknown,3,--Haydn's *The Creation*,3
unknown,unknown,4,Monteverdi Vespers of 1610,4
unknown,unknown,5,Bach Christmas Oratorio (especially the 1st cantata),7
unknown,unknown,6,"Probably most energetic baroque music like Vivaldi concertos (including but definitely not limited to the 4 Seasons), Telemann overtures, pretty much anything by Jean Baptiste Lully",26
unknown,unknown,7,Other Handel: try the coronation anthems. Maybe take a video of baby’s face the first time they hear Zadok the Priest (it builds then it explodes).,26
unknown,unknown,8,Suggestion that’s a little outside the box: Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Most of the humor holds up.,17
unknown,unknown,9,Edit to add: a musical advent calendar from a classical radio station. You can try something new every day.,19
unknown,unknown,0,Others have given great suggestions. I'll just add that Handel's Judas Maccabeus has some very catchy movements:,17
unknown,unknown,1,Just in Act 1:,4
unknown,unknown,2,"* Pious orgies,",3
unknown,unknown,3,"* I feel, I feel the deity within",8
unknown,unknown,4,"* Arm, arm, ye brave",5
unknown,unknown,5,* Call forth thy powers,5
unknown,unknown,6,"* Come, ever-smiling liberty",4
unknown,unknown,7,And of course:,3
unknown,unknown,8,"* Judea, happy land!",4
unknown,unknown,9,* Sound an alarm,4
unknown,unknown,10,"* Father of Heav'n! From Thy eternal throne,",8
unknown,unknown,11,"* See, the conqu'ring hero comes!",6
unknown,unknown,12,* SIng unto God,4
unknown,unknown,13,* Wavy corn,3
unknown,unknown,14,"* Rejoice, O Judah",4
unknown,unknown,15,and the Hallelujah! Amen! finale that rivals the Amen chorus at the end of Messiah.,15
unknown,unknown,16,"Saul is also wonderful, but darker.",6
unknown,unknown,17,"Serse of course contains Ombra Mai Fu, which is just so beautiful.",12
unknown,unknown,18,Waft her gently from Jephtha and Eternal Source of Light Divine are so transcendently lovely.,15
unknown,unknown,19,"I don't know similar music but speaking of the Handel's Messiah, I recommend conductor Gardiner's version.",16
unknown,unknown,20,Water and fireworks maybe,4
unknown,unknown,0,This IS the best one. Objectivel,6
unknown,unknown,1,Edit: I just realized you want recommendations of similar pieces not of good versions messias.,15
unknown,unknown,2,Listen to Bachs Matthew passion. Greatest work of music of all. Hand down,13
unknown,unknown,0,• Handel's other oratorios and operas. I like Rodelinda. Of course in the operas it's more solo arias and the occasional duet or trio. Not so many choirs as in the oratorios.,32
unknown,unknown,1,"• If you like the choirs in Handels Messiah, then you definitely should listen to **Bach**s cantatas and oratorios. I like BWV 198, BWV 34, BWV 11 and many, many others, and would recommend those. Specifically for great choirs I'd mention the opening movements of BWV 248, BWV 72, BWV 63, BWV 5 and BWV 109. Also the final movement of BWV 191 and [the duet in BWV 134](https://open.spotify.com/track/12h5B5BucNevnyGEB9Pkse?si=d60ed7d81e7d418a).",69
unknown,unknown,2,"• If you like the fact that it's not only very good, but at the same time very accessible, listen to Mozart's requiem if you haven't already. And to a lesser extent Pergolesi's Stabat Mater.",35
unknown,unknown,3,"• Other composers that you might want to try: Vivaldi, Charpentier, J.C. Bach, F.X. Richter, Purcell, Rameau, Cavalli, Caldara, Telemann, Erlebach, Monteverdi, J.-H. Fiocco (search for lamentations and petits motets), Hasse and many others",34
unknown,unknown,4,"• Thomas Linley the younger's opening movement to The tempest, which isn't on spotify. There's [a recording on the Hyperion label](https://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dw.asp?dc=W7669_66767), and [a decent video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uk9sNQAt4s).",27
unknown,unknown,5,"• I also really like W.F. Bach's cantata ""Lasset uns ablegen die Werke der Finsternis""",15
unknown,unknown,6,"Edit: forgot to mention Homilius, whose solo arias sometimes have a Handel-like quality.",13
unknown,unknown,7,Gratius agimus tibi!,3
unknown,unknown,8,Handel's setting of *Dixit Dominus* very much sounds like a proto-Messiah. Lots of musical ideas that are going to make much more developed appearances in *Messiah* in their early stages.,30
unknown,unknown,9,Never mind the why and wherefore!,6
unknown,unknown,10,"I second this. Period recordings of baroque and classical period pieces have a light bright feel, very characteristic of the piece.",21
unknown,unknown,11,I have Trevor Pinnock's version.,5
unknown,unknown,12,Thanks! I will check it out!,6
unknown,unknown,13,"Thanks, will have a listen 👍",6
unknown,unknown,14,"Oh damn, the Sixteen is my go to recording of Messiah!",11
unknown,unknown,15,"But, the Matthias Passion is great, but, the Messe in h-moll is the best composition ever. 😄",17
unknown,unknown,16,No BWV 140?,3
unknown,unknown,17,My pleasure! :),3
unknown,unknown,18,"A lot of people think h-moll is #1. My argument for why st Matthew is higher is that the libretto is the greatest story ever told and the most, well, passionate - the passion of Christ. And its longer and it has a larger variety in its music. There are chorales, arias, recitativos, and combinations of the three. The mass only has arias and chorales.",65
unknown,unknown,19,"It's not in my top 10 of favorite Bach cantatas, but the real reason I didn't mention it is I didn't think it would be useful to give a list of *35 cantatas you absolutely should listen to*. On the other hand you're right that BWV 140 maybe has more of a Messiah-vibe than some of the ones I did list.",61
unknown,unknown,20,"Oh I take your point, the Passion tells an amazing story (even if you're not a believer, it's a story of betrayal, suffering, sacrifice, and redemption), the same story the B-minor mass tells (""Gloria in excelsis Deo"", ""Et resurrexit"", etc.), but in a much more visceral way.",47
unknown,unknown,21,"But... there's an amazing variety of styles in the B-minor, and Gratias agimus tibi....",14
unknown,unknown,22,😄,1
unknown,unknown,23,I'm going to listen to what you've listed!,8
unknown,unknown,24,I suppose my main point is that the mass is only a musical work whereas the passion is a musical work with elements of other arts in it like theater and even painting if you include the music's ability to paint a picture with your imagination,46
unknown,unknown,25,"Thanks for your Handel suggestions! I do really love his music, but I don't know all of it.",18
unknown,unknown,26,"Yes, absolutely, you're right!",4
unknown,unknown,27,I have only begun my journey!,6
unknown,unknown,28,"(I've seen, live, what, Messiah\*, Saul, Judas Maccabeus\*, Giulio Cesare\*, Rinaldo, Theodora, Balshazzar, Radamisto, Acis and Galatea, Aci Galatea e Polifemo, La resurrezione, and few others. \* denotes multiple different performances.)",31
z9wic8,IBD,0,How can I talk about my chronic disease without feeling ashamed?,11
z9wic8,IBD,1,Any thoughts on what should i say in a note about my chronic disease to give it to my principal? I tried to explain to my principal that i can’t go to classes he say he’ll try to explain it to other teachers so I can be able to skip all classes.. but rn i need to find a right way to put it in a paper.. and a good words,71

z9wic8,IBD,3,This can change my whole life!,6
z9wic8,IBD,4,I suffer from diarrhea I be going 7 times before getting out of my house and 7-8 times at college. Without eating any food! Also I’m gassy all the time whether I stoped eating or not. That’s why I can’t attend classes. cuz even if I went to the bathroom the min I get out I feel like I wanna shit myself again. So I go back and this feeling won’t go! And being gassy it’s the worse in high school students and even teachers used to complain about the smell! So I can’t do this anymore.. that’s why I need to take online classes and I need to make them understand and make them accept it!,117
z9wic8,IBD,5,Also Sometimes I get constipated which make it worse more gassy and stomach ache…,14
z9wic8,IBD,6,But yk I can’t say these words knowing all of the teachers will know this.. but at the same time I need to make them understand that I literally can’t go to classes.. can you give me some words or a way to say it better?,46
z9wic8,IBD,7,I’d really appreciate it!! It can change my whole life…,10
z9wic8,IBD,8,*btw I gave him a doctor note before about that I can’t attend to class but didn’t explain my condition in it.. he want all my doctors reviews so he can show it to other teachers so they accept..,39
z9wic8,IBD,9,get a 504/accommodation plan,4

z9wrhp,zoloft,0,Anyone currently on zoloft that also is a highly sensitive person?,11
z9wrhp,zoloft,1,"Earlier this year I discovered that all the things I thought made me so different the way I experience the world was just because I'm an HSP (about 20% of the population is!). But now that I was able to identify why I experienced the world a certain way, I realized most of my anxiety, social anxiety, and depression came from this. Just wondering if anyone who's an HSP tried this drug and has has success in being able to manage their anxiety. I'm on day 2, and so far so good, no changes but I didn't expect any just yet.",101
z9wrhp,zoloft,2,"Yes, high chance I am and the meds blunt my emotions. It makes it a lot easier to handle life in general. You can send me a message if u wanna chat.",32
z9wrhp,zoloft,3,"Yes, I'm an HSP on zoloft, and will be undertaking an assessment for autism soon. I'm also a mental health professional. I found that zoloft balances my over reactivity to stimuli and just kinda... chills me out more. I also feel much more positive mood and greater motivation. Hope you have a good experience on it OP. Expect some weirdness in the first few weeks with side effects, but most should diminish with time. About 2 months in is when I really started to feel better 😄",87
z9wrhp,zoloft,4,Been on for a few months now. It’s awesome! I’d say I still retain the traits of HSP but I’m not feeling so anxious and depressed. I feel normal! It’s amazing I never knew I was such a neurotic wreck before until I got better 😂,46
z9wrhp,zoloft,5,"Omg I can’t wait to feel normal and not like I’m WIRED every second of every day. Now that I know where my anxiety/depression is stemming from, somehow I’m even more self aware and it’s not great 😅 I’m so glad you’re having this experience",45
z9wrhp,zoloft,6,All these comments make me so hopeful and persistent to stick out any side effects that will come my way. Thanks for your comment! 😊,25
z9wrhp,zoloft,7,"HSP here! I've been on zoloft for about 6 months and it's been great. I still feel like myself, just without the anxiety.",23
z9wrhp,zoloft,8,Yes I am and I’m in the 90th percentile for neuroticism,11
z9wrhp,zoloft,9,HSP here. It took a while to find the right dosage (made my way to 100 from 25 over six months) but was worth the trial and error. I am much happier and do not dwell on others peoples opinions and actions like I used to. I have more energy and mental space for my family because of it. Good luck!,61
z9wrhp,zoloft,10,I'm commenting now so i can leave a more detailed comment later!!,12
z9wrhp,zoloft,11,I am and I’ve been on Zoloft for 4 years. I did a lot of therapy while on Zoloft and recently started lowering my dose. I’m realizing Zoloft gave me the chance to learn tools to deal with how I feel my way through the world. Zoloft simply lowered the sound to all my feelings so I could process and learn tools. As I turn the volume back up I realize it is no where near as bad. Good luck op.,81
z9wrhp,zoloft,12,"Yes! I discovered I was HSP after starting therapy and starting taking Zoloft. Helped me find balance to move forward. For your info, the first month on Zoloft was really hard for me; hang in there 🙂",37
z9wrhp,zoloft,13,"Started couple a days ago on 25mg, main issue is excessive worrying (as in: out of control) and anxiety; I must say the first pill I took I felt immediately (within 10 minutes) working in on my nervous system. Right now I feel a little dizzy and out of this world, but I get a lot of support from my wife and colleagues at work, as I need to talk about my feelings all the time! I gave it a lot of consideration but at some point I had to draw the line and accept the fact that doing nothing wouldn't help me either.",104
z9wrhp,zoloft,14,I’m glad you found your balance! Thanks for letting me know 😊,12
z9wrhp,zoloft,15,wat like emotionally or like to stuff,7
z9wrhp,zoloft,16,That sounds amazing and gives me hope! Thanks so much for answering,12
z9wrhp,zoloft,17,Yeah such a relief for me as well!!,8
z9wrhp,zoloft,18,Thanks for the reply! I hope I have a good experience on it too :),15
z9wrhp,zoloft,19,I can relate except for the motivation part. It drains my motivation 🥲,13
z9wrhp,zoloft,20,Wow this sounds ideal,4
z9wrhp,zoloft,21,"Thanks so much for your reply! That’s what I’m hoping for, to kind of turn down the volume while I learn how to properly deal with everything I process. Everytime I make some progress, overwhelming emotions take over. So I needed that calm down",44
z9wrhp,zoloft,22,Thanks for telling me! I’m really glad to know it helps :),12
z9wrhp,zoloft,23,Are you sleeping better on zoloft? Perhaps your nervous system is recovering from some burnout and once you've had a big rest your motivation might increase 🤞,27
z9x0sv,forhonor,0,I haven't played in years. How does Lawbringer play atm?,10
z9x0sv,forhonor,1,"When I used to play his kit was very narrow, but I am a huge history nerd which drew me to the game in the first place, and LB had the most ""realistic"" knightly moves and theme. Warden's kit revolved around his shoulder charge move and it looks silly to me.",51
z9x0sv,forhonor,2,"Even though LB moves were limited, he had a high HP pool, so to get better at him you had to be creative with baiting trades and mixups, and I grew to love that playstyle.",35

z9x0sv,forhonor,4,Are there any other characters that play similarly?,8
z9x0sv,forhonor,5,"He’s still the old defensive character. His shove is very safe to land, meaning it can’t be punished.",18
z9x0sv,forhonor,6,"Hell, All of Lawbringers moves can’t be punished.",8
z9x0sv,forhonor,7,"You try to dodge his heavy to guardbreak him, he’ll use his second chain heavy/light.",15
z9x0sv,forhonor,8,"Even if you try to dodge his unblockable heavy and try to guardbreak him, he’ll follow that up with a shove.",21
z9x0sv,forhonor,9,Lawbringer is a mad defensive character…and his mighty catchphrase(Ad Mortem Inimicus) is still uttered gloriously on dominion.,17
z9x0sv,forhonor,10,He's literally the same. No good openers. A decent dodge bash that recovers fast enough to allow him to punish some slow dodge attacks. Lower damage all around but his light parry still deals a lot compared to other heroes. He's pretty much the only turtle left in the game.,50
z9x0sv,forhonor,11,Depending on when you last played he's either completely different or still the same. Right now he isn't very viable competitively because his offense is rather lacking as he has a hard time initiating offense and getting to his finishers. However his parry punishes are still really good. But this means that you are basically forced to play defensively as a lot of other characters have gotten better offense over time. But his core playstyle design has stayed the same. You'll just have to adjust to everything else that's been changed.,91
z9x0sv,forhonor,12,"LB hasn't changed much at all in recent years. The only change I can remember since his ancient rework is that he lost the hyperarmor on his shove. What has changed, though, is the game itself. Moves are faster, with much more of a focus given to making reads as opposed to just reacting to what an enemy is going to do. It may take some getting used to, but by and large, FH these days is much more offensive, whereas lawbringer back in the day was designed to be defensive, so he's a fairly weak character in the current meta.",101
z9x0sv,forhonor,13,"That said, most of the balance in this game is pretty decent, so you can certainly use him to good effect. It's just, that thing you mentioned about having to bait people into things and punish them for it? That's now a much larger part of the game, rather than just a LB thing. You'll be doing that no matter who you play.",63
z9x0sv,forhonor,14,Sounds like the game is in a good spot balance wise. Thanks for the comments. What's a personal recommendation for a character besides LB that I might like?,28

z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,0,48 Hours for a Career Decision,6
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,1,"I currently work in a proprietary Software Support role for a large company, I am due a raise and review in January and have been given responsibility over some automation options and analysis of our chat bot. I have been given an offer that I must respond to in 48 hours for a Help Desk position at a large government contractor. The new role Would shift to general help desk, offer a 2.5k raise, maintain my current benefits, support a secret clearance (biggest deal for me) but I would also could very likely end up at 3rd shift or other similarly odd hours. My questions are as follows:",108
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,2,1. Is the new experience worth the switch?,8
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,3,2. Would my current job be better for a future in development?,12
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,4,3. How valuable is experience with government work at a secret clearance level?,13
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,5,4. Should I speak to my current manager about the possible raise and review?,14
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,6,5. Should I worry about failing to receive the clearance and therefore having left my job for no reason?,19
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,7,6.Is there any more information I could gather that could help my decision?,13
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,8,Thank you to anyone who reads and replies. I’m at a loss.,12
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,9,"To me it sounds like the job you have is better than the one you're going for (you can probably get a 2.5k raise in the review), but there is value in having a security clearance. You can always take the new job, work for a short period then apply to better positions such as something in development if you like. Having the clearance makes finding better and higher paying jobs easy, and if you can find one that will sponsor upgrading your secret to a TS that's even better (although doing this will most likely eliminate almost any fully remote jobs if that's important to you).",107
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,10,"As for failing to receive the clearance, I wouldn't worry unless you know there's something that would eliminate you. Things like undisclosed drug use coming to light, criminal background history, and being in serious debt. By that I mean having bills 120+ days behind and being in collections. If you have a clean background then there's no reason why it wouldn't go through.",63
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,11,"Just give it some thought. If you don't like where you are then it's a no brainer to leave. If you do, you can give it some time to possibly find a better job that will sponsor a clearance, you don't have to take the first one offered.",48
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,12,"Clearance is invaluable. Just work there long enough to get one, and then you're golden.",15
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,13,My experience working in the Federal contractor space was terrible. Wouldn't wish those jobs on my worst enemy.,18
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,14,This really helped ease my anxiety about the decision,9
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,15,Even worth leaving a chill and good job for one potentially much busier and with a possibly MUCH worse schedule?,20
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,16,"My experience is the opposite. I'm a federal contractor now, my first IT job was working for a fortune 100 tech company. I have no desire to go back. The only main downside is that I can't wfh 100% of the time since my job requires TS/SCI clearance and there are things I can only do in a SCIF. But it's easy and the pay is great so it makes up for it.",73
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,17,Yes imo,2
z9xgmy,ITCareerQuestions,18,Should I have worries about failing to get the clearance and losing the opportunity? I have been open with people that know that I have very far left political stances and I’m sure that can be found out about me… but I have great credit and have no criminal history.,50

z9xqt2,autism,1,"I used to have really short hair especially on the sides, and whenever the electric trimmer would get close to my ear, I also get an extreme sensation like im being stabbed in the side of my torso. What makes it worse is that none of these haircuts were voluntary(before i came out as trans) so since I was a “boy” I was forced to get my hair cut short even though I always wanted long hair and the haircut itself was extremely uncomfortable. I was just wondering if this was a trait any other ND people experience because it’s a really niche thing and I can’t find much information on it other than a few reddit threads on men’s forums. It was physically strenuous to hold still and stop my body from moving away from the trimmers.",138

z9y38l,BPD,0,How do I stop myself from splitting,7
z9y38l,BPD,1,So my boyfriend (we got back together) he makes stupid jokes (which I love) but over text my first response is to lash out and luckily I’ve grown enough to not fall into that and try to rationalize cause I know he’s harmless but my intrusive thoughts still get in the way I really need some advice on how to fight it better.,63
z9y38l,BPD,2,Btw these jokes are very light hearted and are not mean or meant to hurt me in anyway.,18
z9y38l,BPD,3,We joke all the time it’s just apart of our relationship and it’s great.,14
z9y38l,BPD,4,"My partner, my friends, and I are also like this and I also find myself responding with my immediate reaction, which is lashing out. Try taking a moment before responding to process how you feel and his intention in his texts. If you still feel angry, you can also communicate that what he said made you upset, even if it is just a joke.",64
z9y38l,BPD,5,"I like to imagine the tone of which the person would be saying it in if it were in person. 99% of the time, it’s that light-hearted joking-ness that I hear.",31
z9y38l,BPD,6,Thank you!!! Most of the time I know he’s joking but there’s always that little voice in the back of my head saying the basic stuff like “he means it.” “Lash out” “he’s trying to be mean.”,37
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,0,How I healed my back pain (Not exactly Neville stuff but I hope mods still approve it and it helps someone here),22
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,1,What I am about to share here is not exactly Neville stuff but basically it's still proof of how powerful our minds are and I am sure will help someone here.,31
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,2,"Anyway I had back problems for most of my life now. I was convinced it was from me growing up gaming and spending lot of time sitting in awkward positions which caused slight curvature in my back. When school started those school desks that I refer to as back breakers didn't help at all. Sitting in them for years and years caused me even more back pain and I was convinced this is never gonna go away. I am now almost 29 years old and I am working 12 hrs a day and I accepted this was gonna be something I am gonna deal with for the rest of my life. At best I hoped it would stay same and not get worse so I ""learned"" to live with it.",130
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,3,"Anyway few months back out of nowhere it got so bad and there was no reason for it to be this bad since I stopped working out, or doing anything that would cause this amount of pain or damage to my back. It got so bad that I couldn't even sit anymore, pain was getting unbearable, and at work I struggled to lift even empty boxes without bending in awkward positions and going through excruciating pain when sitting back up. I took vacation for 3 weeks but it didn't get any better, only worse. I would mostly just lay in my bed and hope it goes way but it didn't.",110
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,4,I hope this is not too much info but one day I couldn't even go to bathroom because sitting down put me in excruciating pain. I tried my best to take shower but I couldn't bend down to take off my socks and this is when I had enough of this BS.,52
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,5,"I sat back and tried to figure out what happened, did I damage some disc in my back, maybe some nerve damage or what is causing this? There has to be a reason.",33
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,6,I eventually realized similar thing happened many times in my life. I had once excruciating pain in my wrist for a week where I couldn't even use mouse or computer and recently even had so much pain in my right foot that I was limping for week and thought I broke my foot. So what was causing all this?,59
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,7,"I realized it was emotions. I know now many of you will roll your eyes and say get the fuck out of here with that Law of Attraction BS, and trust me I would once say that too but it's true.",41
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,8,"I realized it was anger, regret, anxiety. Every time I would feel these emotions it would fire up pain in my body instantly and my life these days is going to shit so I felt so much anger and regret and it caused all this pain. I realized I kept bottling up these emotions and never expressing them and my body was trying to tell me something. I knew there is something to this so I googled it. I researched all this and realized there are some people who realized the same thing. I even checked this sub and found one post that said the same thing, how they healed their back pain with book called ""Healing back pain by John Sarno"" and I found it on YT and listened.",130
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,9,"I knew he was telling the truth because I realized this my self. I kept listening and listening and listening and it made more sense every time and in less than 24 hours all pain was gone. I was in so much pain while listening to this book, I tried fighting off my mind that kept telling me this is BS and how my back is not gonna get better and how something is broken/damaged and I can't fix it with my mind alone. I kept bending down despite excruciating pain and I didn't let my mind win this time. I even went to workout and I couldn't lift my dumbells off floor with my arms because pain was too much but I would bend in very awkward positions and knew I had to beat my mind and pain was not real so I would lift them up any way I could and workout. I went to sleep and woke up with same pain but I didn't give up and during the day it just went away.",177
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,10,I swear I am not making this up. I just couldn't accept this shit anymore and I had to change it at any cost. Now I have 0 pain and If I accepted what my mind told me I would prob now be laying down on my bed and praying to die from all that pain.,56
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,11,Hey I believe it. I think a lot of things are psychosomatic. Do you mind sharing how you released those emotions or what you did specifically,26
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,12,Awesome! Now keep that momentum!,5
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,13,"It’s not BS, there is plenty of scientific evidence on Psychosomatic injuries which is what you are describing. Our minds are powerful tools.

z9y871,NevilleGoddard,18,Wow that's amazing I hope this isn't one of those fake it till you make it scripting stories because dude results in 24 hrs thats really astonishing 😭 i personally got rid of my back nerve pain although it wasn't that sevre but as i stopped thinking about it and just declared i don't have it anymore within a month or few weeks i don't remember properly now but yeah it totally went away,74
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,19,"Also i totally beleive in the stuff you are talking about. Infact there are plenty of people especially some manifestation coach who talks about energy stuff and all . They got results like lighter eye colour , change in voice etc once they started doing energy work . It's surreal how our mind-body can do so much but we limit it with 3 d and logic stupidity",67
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,20,Yeaaaa team Sarno!!! Love seeing his name pop up here.,10
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,21,Cured my trigeminal neuralgia.,4
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,22,"No this is true. It’s all basically pointing out to the same truth that your inner world shapes your outer world. And emotions are part of the as well. If know how to feel our emotions without resisting them which is pretty hard especially with uncomfortable emotions like sadness or anger, then we won’t even manifest bodily pain or mental diseases. I personally used to have these unbearable headaches and then I realized that the root cause of it is repressed anger. Like my belief in the wrongness of anger manifests as headaches. I started looking into why I believe anger is bad and how I can feel my anger. Every time I get headaches I ask myself what am I angry at. By making my pain conscious and releasing it, I am relieved of unconscious need to manifest pain for myself. I have gotten really good at it that I don’t even experience headaches any more.",157
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,23,Truth is that we are conditioned to think emotions are bad and they mess things up while the truth is that they are just guiding you to see what you truly feel. They are not to be hold on to but rather felt.,43
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,24,"And in your case with the back pain, that’s absolutely true. It’s pent up emotions that feel like a burden which is why it manifests as back pain. It’s truly remarkable how we intelligent our bodies are. We just need to be better at listening to it.",47

z9y871,NevilleGoddard,48,"Yea, there is also science behind it. If you take out the energy and religion pieces, perception and therefore reality really is subjective.

z9y871,NevilleGoddard,52,"Well, at the very least there is a huge overlap, and it might depend on what loa coach you’re following. I don’t think I’ve heard Hicks say that the universe decides. And to quote Neville: “your dimensionally larger self speaks to you through the language of desire. Do not de deceive yourself. Knowing what you want, claim you already have it, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give it to you” which sounds to me exactly the same as when Hicks talks about your higher being, or could be interpreted as ‘the universe’. And I know Neville says you can manifest without lifting a finger, but I feel like taking inspired action could be the same thing or very similar to Neville’s bridge of incidents. And when they say vibration attracts, in my interpretation it is basically like Neville’s state. When I focus on everything that is going right for me, and everything I have and love, instead of everything I lack and dislike, I am in the state of having and loving, giving me more things to have and love, or at least that’s how my experience has been.",192
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,53,"So while I don’t really disagree with you, I don’t think I’m entirely wrong either, but a lot of this might have to do with how I personally interpret and experience things :)",33
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,54,Thank you!,2
z9y871,NevilleGoddard,55,I get you 😉,4
z9ybtt,CreditCards,0,Citi Costco Card with 4% on EV charging!,8
z9ybtt,CreditCards,1,"I've had the Citi Costco card for some time now which has been great obviously for Costco purchases as well as gas at 4%. That said, I transitioned to a Tesla Model 3 in the last year was bummed there weren't many options for CC for rewards on charging UNTIL I got an email from Citi in the last couple weeks that states that the 4% include EV charging! This must be relatively new cuz I haven't really seen it advertised on their website. I called Citi a few days ago and confirmed that you will get 4% on transactions that include ""Tesla"" or ""Charging."" The only other cards I know that offer good rewards on EV charging are from Uber. Curious to know if there are other cards other EV drivers would recommend!",134
z9ybtt,CreditCards,2,On the wiki there is a full list of cb on EV charging,13
unknown,CreditCards,0,"They [started](https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/wvd09z/citi_visa_card_4_back_for_ev_charging/) it back in late summer. Citi custom cash also works for 5%, but superchargers are classified as transit.",20
unknown,CreditCards,1,The Wells Fargo Autograph gives 3% on EV charging as well as gas.,13
unknown,CreditCards,2,Good to know,3
unknown,CreditCards,3,Can someone confirm if this 4% EV Charging is at Costco only? My local Costco doesn't have EV charging anyway...,20
z9yezx,UBreddit,0,Why isn’t there a single club focused on Disabled Students?,10
z9yezx,UBreddit,1,"Don’t get me wrong, it is great there are cultural clubs for poc students, for mental health, and clubs for lgbt+ students. But I noticed there isn’t a single club that focuses on disabled students in general. I say this as a person with a disability (adhd + mental health issues but still)",53
z9yezx,UBreddit,2,Would there be interest for a club like this on campus?,11
z9yezx,UBreddit,3,"Edit: I see there is interest, here is the link for a discord server.",14
unknown,unknown,0,We used to have one I was in a year or two before covid but it stopped meeting as people got busy unfortunately and I guess no one ever picked it up,32
unknown,unknown,1,It was the student disability advocacy alliance and we met every month to talk about advocating and projects we could do around campus like possibly tracking when the automatic door buttons wouldn't get fixed for a while,37
unknown,unknown,2,"I’d be interested in this, especially in terms of holding UB accountable for accessibility on campus.",16
unknown,unknown,3,what we even do in that club tho,8
unknown,unknown,4,I think it would be neat. We have a really good disability studies dept and history professors. I’d be interested in advocacy but also hangouts.,25
unknown,unknown,5,I don't see why the club wouldn't be a thing. I think there just hasn't been anyone to step up.,20
unknown,unknown,6,"There's definitely a big problem with accessibility on campus, a ton of the automatic doors just don't work at all",20
unknown,unknown,7,"You know, I was just writing an article along that vein. Actually, would you mind answering a few interview questions related to this subject?",24
unknown,unknown,8,"haha it would be funny because the depressed would think its too much effort and be too tired to go, the anxious would be too scared to join, and both would just join the discord",35
unknown,unknown,9,this is something i’d join for sure,7
unknown,unknown,10,Hi Thnx to all for being concerned about UB. And this is just an opinion UB grad and very shocked that UB has an issue with reasonable accommodation for all. My thing is joined Schussmeister about 10 years ago for the season and asked for a refund or credit to next season as my physical condition changed rapidly. Well documented letter from Doc about degenerative condition.,66
unknown,unknown,11,But the club prez rudely dismissed my concern. Just saying. Wishing all the best.,14
unknown,unknown,12,I had no idea about that! But unfortunately SA doesn’t let you resurrect an old club unlike other schools. A new club with a different name has to be formed.,30
unknown,unknown,13,"What would an LGBTQ club do? What would a Latin American club do? These clubs can bring people of a shared identity together, and that alone can be powerful. But they can also be advocates for change on campus, create safe spaces for marginalized students, or just be a space for people to have fun, watch movies, organize trips, eat good food, etc. Though I am not disabled I imagine there's a LOT such a club could do such as organizing trips that are friendly to disabled people around the Buffalo area, advocating for better accessibility on campus, and creating an environment where people who struggle with a disability can connect and find community on campus.",116
unknown,unknown,14,I didn’t think I would get that far yet.😳,9
unknown,unknown,15,"Edit: Disability Activism, Just getting together in general so there is less isolation and more community. I am open to ideas.",21
unknown,unknown,16,I would love to do hangouts! It can feel lonely when the only major resource on campus is accessibility resources.,20
unknown,unknown,17,"Hell, there is a club for Lettuce enjoyers.",8
unknown,unknown,18,"The closest one is more of a feel good ‘charity’ club for non disabled students to form relationships with disabled adults through the medical school. I would like to assume the club has good intentions. But, not a single one run by disabled students for disabled students.",47
unknown,unknown,19,Ba’dum tss,2
unknown,unknown,20,Yes I will definitely!,4
unknown,unknown,21,"There is a club focused on mental health called active minds, so same can be argued for them 🤨",19
unknown,unknown,22,DM me?,2
unknown,unknown,23,It wasn't under SA which was the best part haha. A different student affairs esque department but I forget which one.,21
unknown,unknown,24,TIL SA has thought of every possible way to suck ass and executes on them all,16
unknown,unknown,25,No you can bring back an old club name. It’s the same process as starting a new club but you can use their premade constitution. I know bc I revitalized the club for Indigenous Students on campus this year despite it being disbanded by SA the year before. (Not all the club requirements were met),55
unknown,unknown,26,"Exactly. Nobody questions any other club. There is a fucking lettuce club, nobody questions their goddamn existence (no offense to anyone involved). Everybody is all about DEI at this damn school until disability is brought up. People either ignore or dismiss our needs (Example: UB and the food allergies,guess what, allergies are a disability!) or they treat us like fragile children.",61
unknown,unknown,27,"To add, anyone who is questioning this club, guess fucking what, everyone has a chance of joining the disability community at any point in their lives. One day you could get a car accident and boom, you are paralyzed. It’s a uncomfortable thought for a lot of people, but it’s true.",51
unknown,unknown,28,"If this school preaches intersectionality, disability needs to be included.",10
unknown,unknown,29,That sounds painfully boring,4
unknown,unknown,30,Be the change :),4
unknown,unknown,31,Awesome! I’ll dm you,4
unknown,unknown,32,"I’m not arguing or making a point tho, it’s just a joke",12
unknown,unknown,33,I would hate to take the name of the other club but that is good to know that there was interest.,21
unknown,unknown,34,"You’re probably thinking of SBI, UB absorbed the money SBI acquired and dissolved the organization a couple years ago, pre covid. Got rid of a shit load of services and programs sbi did and only brought a handful back. Real big shame",42
unknown,unknown,35,Nobody is forcing you to join 🤨,7

z9ys3y,mentalhealth,1,So I’ve been fully focused on my mental health the last like 2 months.,14
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,2,I’ve made massive strides but I’ve hit a point where I feel overwhelmed.,13
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,3,Spiraling thoughts that I can’t seem to shake off. Overwhelming/drowning feeling about job and bills and stuff.,17
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,4,I know logically what’s going on. I used to be able to logic away my issues. Like I could recognize what caused spiraling thoughts and stop them but it’s just not helping right now because of how overwhelming things are.,40
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,5,Deep breathing and som stretching would help…,7
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,6,Now it makes me feel physically nauseous.,7
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,7,I can’t eat (I know I need to) but it makes me feel sick as well.,16
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,8,I can’t give up on my journey and I am DEFINITELY better than where I was but I can’t figure it out.,22
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,9,Worst of all I couldn’t afford therapy this month ($220 a month and I’m in unemployment so with rent and other bills and shit I have like 5 to my name) so I can’t really speak to them.,38
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,10,Does anyone have advice for me? Like I feel overstimulated but I also feel worse while trying to tune out everything. Can’t stand sound but need auditory stimulation. Can’t stand touch but need a hug.,35

z9ys3y,mentalhealth,15,Firstly understand that the ten steps you taken will always mean two back. That’s ok. Your 8 ahead. That’s really good.,21
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,16,At this stage you need to focus on 1% changes. Otherwise it’s overwhelming. What thing can you do today to make things 1% better for tomorrow?,26
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,17,I would say for now that’s to eat. Make sure you have something small for breakfast each day. That’s your challenge. Then for lunch. Then for dinner. Not a amazing meal for now but the rhythm of eating. Then challenge yourself to make a little more effort. Healthier food. New food. But each time one small step.,57
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,18,Music try ambient noise lists on YouTube or Spotify. Or lofi music. It’s much of nothing but not silence.,19
z9ys3y,mentalhealth,19,"If your spiralling thoughts, distractions are good. But that depends what you enjoy and what you are able to do. A sport. A walk. Or if you can try to go 1 min of breathing. Again not 30 mins but one min. Then two. Then three. Steps each time. When your ten mins in remembering you started at 1. Small steps.

z9ytrm,sexualassault,1,"lately ive been watching predator catchers on youtube (like when they pose as minors to catch predators in the act of attempting to meet up with them for sex) and something that really helped me reframe my thinking surrounding the sexual assault i recently suffered is that whenever the predators start making excuses and say shit like ""i made a mistake"" theyre immediately called out and told ""no, you didnt make a mistake. you made a choice"". it just really put things in perspective for me and helped me stop making so many excuses for my ex and its helped me stop blaming myself so much (obviously im not fully to this point in my healing journey yet but again its been helpful). cuz yeah, my ex absolutely had control over his own actions and he chose to ignore my boundaries and chose to pressure me into sex while knowing i didnt want it. idk if this will help anyone else at all, but i just wanted to share that here.",171

So if she does a lot of orange looks, the Natasha Denona Zendo palette might be a nice addition!

z9z0n8,Dogtraining,1,"My 9 month old sheepadoodle is starting to bark in the yard and looking at things out the window. She was a quiet little lamb up until this point. Are we doomed? How do you teach a dog “quiet” if they bark at random things? Also, if outside she’s not going to come if she’s riled up barking. Should we be using a long line in the yard for the foreseeable future so we have more control when this happens?",80
z9z0n8,Dogtraining,2,"When teaching the ""Quiet"" command you would need need a clicker and treats (or whatever your dog likes) and as soon as it stops barking even if its a split second praise keep doing it until it stops barking all together (also eventually over time also start adding a cue word after some repitetion)",54
z9z4gy,Jewish,0,Investigating Jewish ancestors- where to start?,6
z9z4gy,Jewish,1,Hi everyone!,2
z9z4gy,Jewish,2,"My father, uncle and I are keen to look into some family history. I did not grow up Jewish and converted as an adult. Since I've converted, my uncle has come to speak to me about something I'd not heard regarding our family history: my great-grandmother (and therefore my paternal grandmother) were apparently Jewish. We have absolutely no documented evidence of this, however. We're from a country in the former Yugoslavia, and so any evidence would have been disposed of during WWII in order to protect them from persecution. I don't know how feasible it is- but I also don't know how this story would have started if there was nothing to it either.",114
z9z4gy,Jewish,3,Has anyone got any experience with looking into things like this? I'm at a loss at where to start. My great-grandmother was born in Austria- should I start there?,29
z9z4gy,Jewish,4,"Austrian here. It’s mandatory for every inhabitant to have their permanent address registered with the authorities at all times and has been for a very long time - meaning since well into the imperial era, though historic consistency could be compromised if the place of residence ended up being part of another country at some point after the empire was dissolved or sometime inbetween.",64
z9z4gy,Jewish,5,"If you know where they used to live, you can get in touch with the registry office at the town hall (Gemeindeamt in villages, Rathaus or Magistrat in cities) or the national archives and ask them for help finding the historic records (Meldezettel). This should be independent from religious community records and will probably have survived the wars in most cases.",61
z9z4gy,Jewish,6,"Registering personal data like religion was obligatory until very recently, so if your great-grandmother was indeed Jewish, it will say mosaisch or israelitisch in the field for Bekenntnis (creed) on the Meldezettel records.",33
z9z4gy,Jewish,7,"Good luck and let me know if you need anything, I’m more than happy to help with small translations etc.",20
z9z4gy,Jewish,8,Check out jewishgen.org.,3
z9z4gy,Jewish,9,"If you have her name, birth year, and birth place you might be able to find more than you expect.",20
z9z4gy,Jewish,10,My mom tracked out family history. If you have names of family members/know the towns they lived in and when they were born you can see if their are records there (bear in mind you might need to also find someone to translate them to English and family names aren't always spelt consistently).,53
z9z4gy,Jewish,11,Unfortunately the Nazis destroyed a lot of records so you might not have much luck. But believe it or not the Mormon church is a really good resource. They have one of the best archives for birth records because they believe in baptising everyone.,44
z9z4gy,Jewish,12,"I will also say don't worry about not knowing where to start. Its a lot of detective work. For my mom, the process took time, sometimes progression was slow, only finding documents piecemeal, other times she'd find a document and make a bunch of breakthroughs. Either way, its really worth the effort. and Good luck :)",56
z9z4gy,Jewish,13,"I would start by taking a DNA test. If she's Ashkenazi, you'll get clear confirmation of it from the test.",20
z9z4gy,Jewish,14,You can also look through matches and their trees to see if you find anything.,15
z9z4gy,Jewish,15,I have done a completely document trail of my family tree. If you know your grandparents' names and birth years/ other family members it is just a matter of paper trail.,31
z9z4gy,Jewish,16,"All the good advice has already been given; just chiming in to say that this is very plausible, in case (as I perceive from what you wrote) you're skeptical. Many Ashkenazi Jews from Austrian-ruled parts of Europe (Bukovina, Galicia, Austria proper) ended up in Serbia well along the path to assimilation and usually conversion. (I know there were Sephardic communities there but I don't know much about their religious trajectories.)",70
z9z4gy,Jewish,17,Graveyard hunting,2
z9z4gy,Jewish,18,Seconded. This has been an invaluable resource and their newsletters are interesting.,12
z9z4gy,Jewish,19,DNA tests aren't always a good indication of Jewish ancestry. For all they know they might not even be Ashkenazi.,20
z9z4gy,Jewish,20,Thirded. My favorite database to use!,6
z9z4gy,Jewish,21,"So as I said, if this ancestor was Ashkenazi it's a good indicator. Ashkenazi DNA is distinct and easily identifiable. If you have any significant amount of Ashkenazi DNA, it will show up in your results.",36
z9z4gy,Jewish,22,"If the ancestor was Sephardic from the Balkans, a DNA test is still a really good idea. If you look at the 23&Me results of Sephardic Jews from the Balkans, they virtually always get somewhere from 20-45% Ashkenazi in their results. So even if OP is 12.5% Jewish on paper, it would very likely show up in the results.",59
z9z4gy,Jewish,23,"Even if Ashkenazi didn't show up in the results (It very likely would), if you're Serbian or Croatian and you're getting significant results that include a combination of Italian, Broadly Southern European, and Middle Eastern and North African, that's a very strong indicator of Sephardic ancestry as well. The odds that OP would see either Ashkenazi and/or this combination of Southern European and Middle Eastern if they are truly 12.5% Jewish is virtually 100%.",74
z9z4gy,Jewish,24,"A fully Jewish ancestor (Ashkenazi or otherwise) in the last 4 generations is more likely than not to show up unambiguously in a DNA test. But especially if Ashkenazi, it's not going to be very helpful for discovering details of their background.",42
z9z4gy,Jewish,25,Fourthed. I'm a professional and when people ask me what I use... I surprise them by saying that JewishGen is still my first (plus) stop,25
z9z4gy,Jewish,26,"Oh absolutely and also like you said it's a good idea to look at matches as well. For cases like this I'd recommend using Ancestry, this way you can build up a tree and with their DNA testing they match you to others who have also taken the tests and you can find ancestors you had no clue about.",59
z9z4gy,Jewish,27,"Yep, I found out I had more Jewish ancestry than I knew of through one of my great grandmothers, and no one in the family knew. It came up in my DNA test, along with the rest of my Ashkenazi ancestry, and they were able to pinpoint some of the countries her line originated from.",55

z9zovj,Destiny,0,Don't let establishment Republican voices like Shapiro distance themselves from the Ye drama. This is a direct result from allowing conspiracy nutjobs into your party.,25
z9zovj,Destiny,1,"The former Republican president of the US just had dinner with these guys a few days ago. Even saying he liked Fuentes. These Republicans are going to play this off like this has nothing to do with them. Fuck you, you made your bed now lay in it.",48
z9zovj,Destiny,2,I see “moderate” swing district House members denouncing Fuentes but are silent on Trump. Don’t let these cucks get away with going halfway on denouncing hatred and bigotry. Steven was right the Republicans made their bed now it’s time to lie in the shit that they let infest their party. Only way for them to learn is for this to fucking obliterate them,63
z9zovj,Destiny,3,Charlie Kirk was dick riding hard last year and has now scrubbed every mention of ye from his twitter,19
z9zovj,Destiny,4,Part of the Faustian bargain of Reagan’s Revolution is to marry corporate interests and hate based politics into synthesis. Shapiro et. al. know the cost of what their political party agreed to.,32
z9zovj,Destiny,5,"I think you could say this stuff about people like crowder and some other right wing people, but Ben has typically pushed against the more crazy ideas like the election denialism and janurary 6th stuff. Although his opinions on gay marriage is dogshit for sure. I just don’t think it’s fair to lump him in with people like Alex Jones and Ye.",62
z9zovj,Destiny,6,LMAO you’re reaching so hard,5
z9zovj,Destiny,7,Trump talks to anyone with significance. He has a pre existing relationship with Kanye. And he told Kanye to fuck off when he went crazy.,25
z9zovj,Destiny,8,"The Republican Party is more pro Israel than the democrats, so I don’t know where you get this idea that literal Jewish people have no right to tell anti semites to get out of their party. Unhinged.",37
z9zovj,Destiny,9,"Doesn't Ye want to run independent anyway? I mean he'd run R way before D of course, but I doubt you can actually pin this current shitshow to republicans",29
z9zovj,Destiny,10,Okay but what then?,4
z9zovj,Destiny,11,"This is the best opportunity for republicans to distance themselves from trump and the crazies, why not let them do that? Isn't that what we want? wouldn't that be more productive?",31
z9zovj,Destiny,12,"Ngl, your post feels vindictive.",5
z9zovj,Destiny,13,Isn't that unfair.,3
z9zovj,Destiny,14,Didn't like sharpio and Trump always distanced themselves from stuff like that?,12
z9zovj,Destiny,15,Are we arguing similar when Joe Biden talks with evil world leaders?,12
z9zovj,Destiny,16,Thanks for actively trying to lose elections!,7
z9zovj,Destiny,17,"If you're a Democrat, please, please do this. Talk incessantly about how Republicans no matter how much they denounce a message cannot be let off the hook for a message they never endorsed and actively repudiated. Please, seriously, follow this dumbfuck advice.",42
z9zovj,Destiny,18,"Sincerely, Republicans running in 2024 and 2026.",7
z9zovj,Destiny,19,"None of these people involved in this are republicans. Kanye, Fuentes, Milo...all have a history of hating the republican party. Even very conservative people like Matt Walsh and Shapiro wouldn't consider any of these people conservative or republican...just like Destiny wouldn't consider Jackson Hinkle or Jimmy Dore true leftists. This is a moronic post. Republicans love Israel and Jews even more then most Democrats. If anything a large part of the democratic party hates Zionism and is pretty outright anti-Semitic also. See Ilhan Omar and Rashid Talib. Also nobody ""lets"" people into parties homie...that isn't how this works. Obviously Shapiro would denounce everything YE is saying...hes Jewish. This post is just partisan hackery. Sorry bro.",115
z9zovj,Destiny,20,"This is really important to remember if Trump is convicted of anything and can't run. They'll try to disassociate from him and they can't be allowed to, hopefully democrats will keep track of their asskissing and deploy that information well.",40
z9zovj,Destiny,21,The problem is that Kanye said the quiet part out loud.,11
z9zovj,Destiny,22,Supporting Trump in 2020 means supporting his baggage and horde of conspiracy rotted brained crazies he brought with him. He doesn't get off the hook imo.,26
z9zovj,Destiny,23,The only Republicans which get a pass are people like Romney and Liz Cheney who didn't buy Trump's shit from the go,22
z9zovj,Destiny,24,"Based. The repubs, even the most extreme ones, are all rhetoric, when it comes to policy they all voted to send money to Ukraine, and are even now changing course to appeal more to moderates by passing the gay marriage bill. The repubs are dogshit, but lets not act they're on the level of nazis.",55
z9zovj,Destiny,25,I mean this whole thing transpired because of Trump 2016.,10
z9zovj,Destiny,26,"This is basically direct result of what happens when people treat politics like sports teams. With sports you want your opponent to be shit so you can win easily but with politics you actually want both sides to be as strong as possible so they feel like the only way for them to ""beat their opponent"" is by doing as good of a job as possible to appeal the voters. If you would have either side be complete crap and irredeemable for the public for some time, this would only lead to the leading side taking as much of an advantage of the position they are in as possible- fuck the ordinary people, they will still have to vote for them because in their perception the other side is even worse",131
z9zovj,Destiny,27,"Reverse the roles for a second and let's say they met with Obama and not Trump. You think Shapiro would be like ""Hey guys I'm sure Obama wanted nothing to do with them so we shouldn't get on the Dems about this."" Yeah no fucking way. I don't see why we should be more charitable than they would be.",59
z9zovj,Destiny,28,"I mean no, I would never expect republicans to have spines or morals. We should never expect them to denounce any craziness in their party. Atleast they're dying in greater numbers than democrats.",33
z9zovj,Destiny,29,TIL supporting a candidate for a political position means you support literally everything halfway adjacent to them,17
z9zovj,Destiny,30,"I mean Ben didn’t like trump from the get go either but he voted for him in 2020 because the Republican Party aligns up with his ideals more. I know a lot of people that vote republican because they agree with them more on issues even if they hate the candidate. I did. Now in retrospect, after the election denial stuff and janurary 6th stuff I won’t be supporting the Republican Party again, at least for a long time. But I get why some people vote for their party even if the candidate is not good.",96
z9zovj,Destiny,31,"What, Ye saying he loves Hitler?",6
z9zovj,Destiny,32,"Well, shapiro can do w.e he wants, that doesn't mean we should follow what they're doing. We should have more agency.",21
z9zovj,Destiny,33,Hahahahahahaha. You're such a good person.,6
z9zovj,Destiny,34,>he voted for him but he didn't like him,9
z9zovj,Destiny,35,It's time for conservatives to grow the fuck up and accept that this doesn't change that they're responsible for the shit ***they voted in***,24
z9zovj,Destiny,36,"Yes, and the whole groyper/alt-right movement that groomed Kanye for this",11
z9zovj,Destiny,37,I'm just tired of people that storm the capitol and deny covid. It's exhausting when half the country is caught in a fever dream.,24
z9zovj,Destiny,38,"To be fair, most Republicans that aren't terminally online, which is probably the majority of Republicans that actually vote don't really know or care who Kanye or nick fuentes or any of these people are. My dad likes Trump and voted for him but I'd bet my left arm that he isn't even aware of anything thats happened with Kanye over the past month",64
z9zovj,Destiny,39,"Who votes in insane talk by Ye, Fuentes, and Milo? Conservatives didn't vote for this. These three hate the republican party. WTF are you even talking about? Trump doesn't believe in any of this shit.",35
z9zovj,Destiny,40,What percentage of Republicans are vaccinated?,6
z9zovj,Destiny,41,How many people stormed the capitol?,6
z9zovj,Destiny,42,Fuck off trumpie,3

z9zovj,Destiny,45,Thanks for the year ago poll based on data from limited availability time frame. Now... in the present... the difference is less than 5%.,24
z9zovj,Destiny,46,Guess who isn't vaccinated? Low risk people under the age of 30 mostly. Fucking eh.,15
z9zovj,Destiny,47,"Yeah, it wasn't an attack on the government, you lot that think it is are almost as braindead as those that trespassed in the Capitol on 1/6.",27
z9zovj,Destiny,48,It wasn't an attack on the government? What do you think the people storming the capitol where there to do exactly?,21
z9zovj,Destiny,49,Mostly? Trespass unintentionally.,3
z9zovj,Destiny,50,Not interfere with the election certification right? Just some mild trespassing at the same time the election was being certified?,20
z9zovj,Destiny,51,Do you really think the Q Anon Shaman was going to overturn the results of the election?,17
z9zovj,Destiny,52,I think that they were trying to do that yes. Just because you commit a crime incompetently doesn't make it not a crime.,23
z9zovj,Destiny,53,Oh so the people that burned the statehouse in Oregon were Seditionists too?,13
z9zovj,Destiny,54,"Yep. Exactly. These leftist and leftys cannot actually engage. Par for the course. Your daddy Destiny can only give you so many takes, and spoilers, most are weak(maybe not weak, but certainly, ""attackable"".)",33

z9zxv6,Peterborough,0,What is the building between the Kia dealership and the old Trentwinds on Lansdowne?,14
z9zxv6,Peterborough,1,I've lived here my whole life and I've never figured out what's actually going on there. It almost looks like an abandoned motel but I see vehicles there and random mattresses thrown around.,33
z9zxv6,Peterborough,2,That's the trentwinds hotel. Pretty sure it's vacant now. Possible that there's squatters.,13
z9zxv6,Peterborough,3,Don't ask don't tell type situation.,6
z9zxv6,Peterborough,4,Isn't that just an annex for the motel?,8
z9zxv6,Peterborough,5,There was a freight booking company that had an office in one of the rooms at the front at one point. No idea if they are still there.,28

za055k,askatherapist,0,How can I help a depressed child?,7
za055k,askatherapist,1,I work as a teachers aid at an elementary school. One of the children in the third grade class I primarily work in shows significant signs of depression. She comes from a troubled home life and is wise beyond her years,41
za055k,askatherapist,2,….in a really bad way.,5
za055k,askatherapist,3,"She speaks and behaves almost more like an angsty pre teen than an 8 year old child. She struggles with coping skills and every time something doesn’t go her way she breaks down like the world is falling apart and everyone is out to get her. If someone hurts her on accident, she will not listen to them apologize, she just decides they did it on purpose and doesn’t want to hear otherwise. She acts like she’s horribly bullied but she has a group of friends who just kind of get fed up with her drama at times and don’t wanna hang out anymore. She does have days where other kids are mean to her, it’s a problem at our school, but she also can be a bully herself.",129
za055k,askatherapist,4,How can I help raise the self esteem of a child who absolutely doesn’t want to be helped and seems to want the drama of being the victim? What can I do for her?,34
za055k,askatherapist,5,"Listen to her, whatever she needs or wants to talk about. As well as acting as a safety valve to burn off unwanted feelings, listening is the way we show someone they are likeable and worthy.",36
za055k,askatherapist,6,"Without changing her core situation, there is a limit to what you can do to change her. But listening without trying to steer the conversation or impose a view should help her feel better and people who feel better tend to act better.",43
za055k,askatherapist,7,She will be capricious and unreasonable sometimes. That's ok. Allowing her to express her feelings means listening to some odd thoughts.,21
za055k,askatherapist,8,"Secondary tack might be to increase her sense of autonomy: ask her advice on minor things, allow her to make decisions etc. And even if in reality she has little choice in some areas, ask her which thing she might like to do first and so on.",47
za055k,askatherapist,9,"Lastly, I wish every troubled child had someone like you caring about them. Thank you for what you do.",19
za055k,askatherapist,10,oh man thats like looking into a mirror haha. always helped to have teachers when they seemed like they really tried to make a connection with me and understand me and just be a safe space. maybe ask before or after class how theyre doin and that youre there for them or whatever. i remember that being a little awkward for me but its kinda nice to know at the same time,72
za055k,askatherapist,11,"I’m gonna be honest, I’m autistic and drama was something I struggled with growing up. I tended to use drama for attention because at school it seemed to be the thing that made the other girls care about one another. Whoever was the saddest that day had the most people surrounding them. So as an adult drama is something I struggle with because it’s hard for me not to see it as wanting attention. I find myself getting annoyed when something minor happens and she’s crying AGAIN, but I’m also trying really hard to change my viewpoint and figure out why the behavior is happening.",105
za055k,askatherapist,12,I appreciate everyone’s help so far.,6
za055k,askatherapist,13,But what is wrong with wanting attention?,7
za055k,askatherapist,14,NAT!,1
za055k,askatherapist,15,"I was kinda like this too when I was younger. I think a big part of it is that the kid probably does want attention, she just doesn’t know how to ask for it appropriately. I had all these feelings and things going on but I didn’t know how to ask anyone for help, so I did things that I thought might help me connect with people. Sometimes it worked in a way, but it’s hard to form meaningful connections when I wasn’t even fully aware I needed help. That was just my life. Hope that kinda makes sense :)",100
za055k,askatherapist,16,"Whenever we feel like a kid is out to get attention, replace the word attention with connection and that's probably the more true statement.",24
za055k,askatherapist,17,Goes for more than just children!,6
za055k,askatherapist,18,"But also, there's genuinely nothing wrong with wanting attention. It's a normal human need.",14
za055k,askatherapist,19,"Many of us were brought up to feel like we are ""too much."" Like we want and need too much. We've taken a normal human need for attention and proclaimed it ""too much,"" fought against it, then we see it in others & it brings up reactions in us.",49
za055k,askatherapist,20,"But it's OK to want attention. It's OK to want comfort and soothing. And especially for children, they have to be taught how to self soothe and self comfort. And if nobody teaches them how...and nobody provides them external soothing and comfort... they will desperately be looking for it. Potentially their whole lives.",53
za055k,askatherapist,21,"I'm 35 years old, and I was neglected. I want attention... I want my therapist's attention. I want his comfort. I internalize it & use it when I am alone to soothe my own young parts.",36

za0d5d,travel,1,"Hi there, so I'm travelling to Southeast Asia for the first time in the new year!",16
za0d5d,travel,2,"I'm not a fast paced kind of person so my original plan was to spend a few months exploring and living in Thailand, to really get a good experience of the place and be immersed in the culture. Of course I was open to visiting a couple of other countries as well whilst I am over there. There is a multiple entry tourist visa for Thailand that I can use for up to 6 months, although I will have to leave the country after 60 days before I can re-enter, which costs £150.",93
za0d5d,travel,3,"However, I am also aware that currently I can spend 45 days in Thailand on a visa exemption, and possibly another if I return (although I'm not 100% sure on this). Considering this is free, and I'm quite keen now on visiting countries like Vietnam on a month-long visa, I am now undecided on whether its worth spending that much money for the long term Thailand visa if I can hop around other countries instead.",75
za0d5d,travel,4,What would people recommend? Is it worth getting the multiple entry visa? I know some people who go on a visa exemption to Thailand and say it isn't long enough!,30
za0d5d,travel,5,It would also be helpful to know how many times you can get a visa exemption for Thailand.,18

za0l8g,AITAH,0,AITAH for being upset my fiancé skipped a birthday dinner I planned?,12
za0l8g,AITAH,1,So I asked all week what he wanted to do for his birthday and he said idk every time I asked. Last year I threw him a party and he loved it! This year I told him I wanted to do something special but he didn’t give me any ideas so I book a couple reservations so he could pick one. I even took off work:( Today is his birthday and he just left to hang out with his friend and said he wouldn’t make dinner :-/. I texted him saying I am a little hurt ur not letting me give u something nice on your birthday and he said he is just never going to tell me when he is going to hang out with friends because it ruins everything. And for context I was invited for a family thing they did a couple of days back but he had them schedule it when I was working. I know it’s his birthday but I am feeling a little sad and left out and disappointed I wasn’t able to do something special with him and he didn’t want to do anything with me.,193
za0l8g,AITAH,2,"Sounds like he's your boyfriend, not your fiance. You are NTA for being upset. Be careful about this guy. Sounds like a flake.",23
za0l8g,AITAH,3,NTA:,1
za0l8g,AITAH,4,"It's raining red flags babe! The streets are absolutely flooded with them! If he's already showing that he has little to no interest in spending time with you or any consideration for the effort made on your part to do something special FOR HIM, then what can you expect in return? When it's your birthday or a day worth celebrating? Do you think he'll put any effort into making it special for you? I'll wait....I thought as much. Don't waste your time or energy on someone who doesn't deserve you. Much love!",92
za0l8g,AITAH,5,So I just went back and read your post from 34 days ago about him not sticking up for you. I saw your edit that he added that girl back on snap and tried to hide it from you.,39
za0l8g,AITAH,6,"Do you not see these huge red flags?? If you want to know how he spent his birthday, probably want to check out her snapchat or IG….",27
za0l8g,AITAH,7,"He sounds like an idiot, he's never going warn you when he want to hang out with his friends? What?",20
za0l8g,AITAH,8,"I had a boyfriend like yours. My friends said that I was going out with him, but he wasn't going out with me. Are you sure he's your boyfriend or are you just his FWB?",35
za0l8g,AITAH,9,"NTA....if he acts like this in the ""still not married, I better act decent"" phase..it will get much worse once you are married. You may want to take a hard look at what you want...and consider if he is willing to make any effort for you....",46
za0l8g,AITAH,10,I have many friends who have wasted a decade plus only to finally get dumped when the trash significant other/fiance moves on (cheats) with whomever they feel is more important.,30
za0l8g,AITAH,11,"NTA. This is not going to be what you want to hear but this comes across like he doesn’t want you to be an active part of the rest of his life, and potentially could be cheating.",37
za0l8g,AITAH,12,"Deliberately excluding you from his family is a major, major red flag (assuming he was actually with his family). By getting married you would be his family so this is really odd.",32
za0l8g,AITAH,13,"The attitude of ‘I don’t need to tell you were I’m going or when I’m doing things’ is an attitude someone has to something they’re casually seeing, not their fiancé. Again, major, major red flag (again, assuming he was actually with his friends).",43
za0l8g,AITAH,14,"The other issue is NOT that he wouldn’t let you do something nice for him, it’s that you made plans that he knew about in advance and he didn’t show up. If he does that for HIS birthday, he’s going to do it on other occasions that don’t revolve around him.",51
za0l8g,AITAH,15,"I’m really surprised that someone would propose to a partner then treat them like this to be honest. It sounds like either he’s pushing you out and a break up may be coming, or he’s cheating.",36

za0l8g,AITAH,17,Nta and honestly it kinda sounds like he’s cheating on you and giving a bad excuse,16
za0l8g,AITAH,18,Sounds like he doesn't even like you tbh. Take a look at your relationship. This behavior is not normal in couples.,21
za0l8g,AITAH,19,"NTA, get your ducks in row. Sounds like that dude wants to get rid of you",16
za0l8g,AITAH,20,"NTAH. He's being a jerk. If he wanted to spend time with his friends, fine but he needed to communicate with you since you made it clear by repeatedly asking him what he wanted to do on his birthday that you wanted to spend time with him, so not discussing this with you is rude af.",56
za0l8g,AITAH,21,"That, combined with the family thing is giving me red flags. Are you sure this man loves you?",18
za0l8g,AITAH,22,NTA but you will be if you stay with him. He doesn’t respect you or care about your feelings. You need to move on and find someone who will treat you right.,32
za0l8g,AITAH,23,Someone mistreating you is their fault. Allowing them to continue doing it is your fault...,15
za0l8g,AITAH,24,"NTA for how you feel, but YWBTA to yourself if you keep wasting energy on him. He made it clear to you that you are not important or a priority. He is purposefully making sure you can’t make or be involved in events. Sounds like he might be seeing someone else and even if he isn’t, I’m not sure how much more clear he could be on how little he respects you and your time.",75
za0l8g,AITAH,25,"This is another of these NTA for being upset, but YTA a little bit for hanging on to a guy like this and thinking you're going to be able to build a future with him. Y'all need a bit more self-respect and a bit less him in the mix. I'm sure his friends will be happy to have him.",59
za0l8g,AITAH,26,He’s not a keeper. Only cares about himself. More fish in the sea!,13
za0l8g,AITAH,27,What is he? 12?,4
za0l8g,AITAH,28,NTA. Do not marry this person.,6
za0l8g,AITAH,29,"NTA run fast, run far.",5
za0l8g,AITAH,30,"I misread 'fiancé ' as 'friend' and was going to say this guy obviously does not consider you to be a close friend, you like him more than he likes you. I think that still stands. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life in that position?",50

za0l8g,AITAH,33,"Ok I'm not sure I'm reading this right. You wanted to do something special and you kept asking him what to do. His answer was always ""I don't know"". So you made restaurant reservations. Did he know you made those reservations? Not mind reading or the hints were obvious, but you said ""I made reservations for your birthday dinner at 6 on your actual birthday, sound good?"".",67
za0l8g,AITAH,34,If you told him clearly about the plans then he's definitely in the wrong. If you just assumed he would know you finally came up with an idea then you're in the wrong.,33
za0l8g,AITAH,35,Definitely NTA and i would be incredibly hurt too! Yeah it’s his birthday but you talked to him and tried to plan something for him and he completely blew you off like you don’t matter. He’s very inconsiderate and even a little selfish and rude. He he like that in other aspects of your relationship?,55
za0l8g,AITAH,36,"I mean it’s not cool or okay what he did, he’s definitely moving suspicious. He’s clearly showing he doesn’t fancy your company much, or want you to be around his friends!! It’s also for a reason you need to find out the reason! Besides that don’t be to hurt, find something you enjoy doing, keep your money with this economy every penny counts! You make sure you get your lick back too! He doesn’t sound mature though, and seems very odd by your wording, such ass never going to tell you when he’s going to hang out because it ruins everything. Can you detail what he meant it doesn’t sit well with what you texted him.",116
za0l8g,AITAH,37,Did you ever communicate your plans to him? Did he actually know you had taken off work and made plans?,20
za0l8g,AITAH,38,I’d be super hurt!! NTA! You guys clearly have some things to work out about hanging out with other friends figure out giving each other time alone with some friends if you want and also why can’t you be prt of that hang out sometimes? Especially being his SO on his birthday🤷‍♀️,52
za0l8g,AITAH,39,NTA - He doesn’t care enough about you to include you in his plans. Please take this as face value.,20
za0l8g,AITAH,40,NRA. Grab you fiancé’s hair tightly so you can pull his head out of his ass - it is so far up. Fiancé trumps friends in spontaneous stuff. Tell him to grow up,33

za0l8g,AITAH,42,Girl please take those blinders off so you can see all the red flags.,14
za0l8g,AITAH,43,Are you sure he was hanging out with friends? These are not behaviors of a fiance. Please look really hard into this relationship and decide if this is the lifelong commitment you deserve.,33
za0l8g,AITAH,44,"Oh honey, seems like he is not in a relationship with you anymore.",13
za0l8g,AITAH,45,NTH he doesn't seem to care about you,8
za0l8g,AITAH,46,"NTA, but I bet your fiancé has a girlfriend or two that he is spending time with. Time to reevaluate what you want in life.",25
za0l8g,AITAH,47,Run!!!!,1
za0l8g,AITAH,48,"Next time, do not surprise him so he will know that that time is to focus on the two of you. This way, there are no misses.",27
za0l8g,AITAH,49,"Having them reschedule a get together when she won't be able to make it sounds like hes got a foot out the door. Now the bday no show, he's saying alot here.",32
za0l8g,AITAH,50,Yup these comments are correct. This is not going to get better after you're married. You don't want to be locked down into a marriage where your feelings are being disregarded. Don't settle for that kind of treatment especially from a potential life partner. You will always complain about this issue and similar issues. Run while you still can.,59
za0l8g,AITAH,51,NTA I am sorry for you but his attitude is problematic. He purposely arranges to exclude you from a family thing where you were invited? He won’t tell you when he goes out with his friends because it ruins the fun? Are you sure you want to spend your life with this person? The disrespect is staggering.,57
za0l8g,AITAH,52,Oh.... He's distancing himself from you. Be prepared for a break up in the near future.,16
za0l8g,AITAH,53,"Red flag full stop. If they chose to hang out with ""friends"" on their birthday instead of you I would look into what ""friends"" were there. . . Sounds like side action",32
za0l8g,AITAH,54,"He wants you to break up with him. Everything he's doing it, screams it.",14
za0l8g,AITAH,55,"Run. RUN. A fiance who wants to ""hang out with his friends"" without YOU on his birthday? If you're LUCKY, he's just a selfish narcissistic jerk who's showing how little he cares about you. But I'm guessing he spent his birthday with his girlfriend.",44
za0l8g,AITAH,56,NTA he’s an overgrown man child. It’s obvious that he doesn’t care about you.,14
za0l8g,AITAH,57,INFO: Why are you wasting your life with this jackass?,10
za0l8g,AITAH,58,He's just not into you any longer. Who asks someone to schedule an event when you are working?,18
za0l8g,AITAH,59,Are you sure he hasn't got another secret gf hidden somewhere because he's going to great lengths to avoid you. NTA but he's showing you who he really is so take heed and reconsider this relationship. He's a walking bag of red flags right now.,45
za0l8g,AITAH,60,Is his friend male or female if female than he might be cheating,13
za0l8g,AITAH,61,"Hello BF's butt, let me introduce my feet. Feet, meet butt HARD!!! BF, GTFO!",14
za0l8g,AITAH,62,"Sounds like fiancé may be having second thoughts about the engagement. If you were his priority, he wouldn’t blow off your prior plans for his own plans that he’s never going to tell you about. If he’s serious about never telling you, is that the kind of life you want? For that matter, is his current actions what you want?",60
za0l8g,AITAH,63,Good luck!,2
za0l8g,AITAH,64,Please !UpdateMe about whatever happens.,5
za0l8g,AITAH,65,"I misread 'fiancé ' as 'friend' and was going to say this guy obviously does not consider you to be a close friend, you like him more than he likes you. I think that still stands. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life in that position?",50

za0l8g,AITAH,67,YTA. It's not your birthday. Let him do what he wants.,11
za0l8g,AITAH,68,Why would it ruin it if he tells you he’s going to hang out with his friends? Is this purely a bizarre and shitty attitude from him or have you fought about it in the past?,36
za0l8g,AITAH,69,NTA.,1
za0l8g,AITAH,70,People prioritize what’s important to them. Period. You weren’t included in the family event and he bailed on you for his birthday. He is telling you that you are not a priority and not important to him. I’m so sorry. That would not feel good. Your actions were thoughtful and caring. You deserve the same thoughtful response and level of effort in return. This relationship doesn’t sound like it’s in your best interest.,73
za0l8g,AITAH,71,Does he do anything wonderful for your b-day.,8
za0l8g,AITAH,72,"He made sure she wasnt included in the family event, he intentionally excluded her from his birthday, and purposefully left her alone at home on a milestone event. sounds like he goes to great length to make sure she knows she is not important and part of his life, this is more than casually flaky behavior, he is isolating her and ignoring her, and the overt disrespect in his words that he is never going to tell her about hanging our with friends, i see serious emotional abuse in op's future.",91
za0l8g,AITAH,73,"How come that the status and responsability change immediatly after getting engaged? I am not engaged, but my boyfriend already has all responsabilities he will have as a husband (except Children of course). I don´t get that the labeling is so important for your role.",45
za0l8g,AITAH,74,He barely sounds like a boyfriend. I'd dip.,8
za0l8g,AITAH,75,"Barely a boyfriend, at that.",5
za0l8g,AITAH,76,I bet he’s either cheating or already warned the friend group OP is on the way out. Purposely vague birthday plans AND a “family thing” scheduled for a time his girlfriend of more than a year can’t be there? Plus trying to flip the responsibility to OP with “you’ve ruined everything?”,51
za0l8g,AITAH,77,Who’s this “friend” he’s meeting again?,6
za0l8g,AITAH,78,See. This.,2
za0l8g,AITAH,79,Sounds like what OP wants is just space for venting and validation.,12
za0l8g,AITAH,80,Fuck! I wish we could see the red flags through rose colored glasses.,13
za0l8g,AITAH,81,"""Love makes fools of all of us"" -William Thackeray",9
za0l8g,AITAH,82,Bingo. This was my thought as well. OP he is telling you blatantly that you are not a priority to him. Be wise and listen.,25
za0l8g,AITAH,83,"I’m wondering if there was a proposal at all or if this is just a title that was given to him. Because he sounds like a FWB, not a fiance.",30
za0l8g,AITAH,84,"Even if he didn’t know there were firm plans, he did know she was wanting to plan something. So he’s still the AH because then he supposedly made plans but didn’t include her.",33
za0l8g,AITAH,85,He definitely knew because he wanted to try this new buffet,11
za0l8g,AITAH,86,It basically because there have been other times he has promised me something then went with his friends,18
za0l8g,AITAH,87,Does she need to….it’s his birthday,6
za0l8g,AITAH,88,Most normal people who like their partners would ask said partner “what are we doing for my birthday”,18
za0l8g,AITAH,89,Or know them enough to know she or he would have planned something,13
za0l8g,AITAH,90,He’s the AH here,4

za0l8g,AITAH,97,Your relationships must suck,4
za0l8g,AITAH,98,"The behaviour definitely screams FWB but if they aren’t actually engaged and OP just calls refers to him as her fiancé, that would be really odd on OP’s part",29
za0l8g,AITAH,99,"She's said he definitely knew, so it's not really relevant. But I enjoy discussing possibilities and assume you do as well since you responded after she clarified.",27
za0l8g,AITAH,100,"If she never made it clear what the plans were then he's not wrong for thinking there aren't any. Not everyone celebrates their birthday on their actual birthday. Perhaps he thought it would be a weekend thing. Or perhaps he thought she would do something but then she was home and nothing, nothing, nothing so when his friends invited him to something he frustratedly picked something over nothing. He's not a mind-reader and shouldn't be blamed for her lack of communication. It's his birthday, he can spend it how he wants. He didn't break plans with her to hang out with his friends because he didn't know there were plans.",110
za0l8g,AITAH,101,"How often do we see people here with his story? ""I always do a ton for his birthday and this year I'm sitting home waiting for anything to happen. He even has the day off of work, but so far all he's done is watch a movie by himself. My friends invited me to go out but I said no because I'm sure he'll do something. Well reddit, he didn't. We got in a big fight at bedtime and he says I'm TA for blaming him that I didn't go with my friends. He never said we had plans so it's my fault for assuming. He says he had reservations at a hotel for us for this weekend but now he's cancelling because he's mad at me.""",127
za0l8g,AITAH,102,If there's no communication then that's the problem. He's not at fault for her lack of communication.,17
za0l8g,AITAH,103,"Again, all hypothetical as she's stated that he did know.",10
za0l8g,AITAH,104,"I’m sorry but if my husband ignores it my birthday was coming up and didn’t even acknowledge it and then expected me to be free and not make plans, I’d be perfectly in the right to do that. When you plan to surprise someone you have to actually make sure they’re available. So it’s actually very important to know if she asked or told him that she made plans for him.",71
za0l8g,AITAH,105,On the contrary...,3
za0l8g,AITAH,106,I totally agree. However I have read stories about people somehow assuming they’re engaged when they’re really not.,18
za0l8g,AITAH,107,"I completely see your point and don’t necessarily disagree with that possibility. However, I did read another post by her from a little over a month ago. I think that they are not on the same page in terms of where they are in their relationship. I think she views their relationship as more serious than he does.",58
za0l8g,AITAH,108,I agree she should have told him and it’s not clear if OP told him but still he should have at least asked or known that she would plan something,30
za0l8g,AITAH,109,Plus with the additional information of hun planning stuff without her,11

za0stf,ModernWarfareII,1,"So, the thing is that I’m Swiss and I wanted to vote for Switzerland, but:",15
za0stf,ModernWarfareII,2,First time I missed it bc lack of communication on CoD (didn’t know you could vote for your country in game),21
za0stf,ModernWarfareII,3,Second time I think I was too late for the vote,11
za0stf,ModernWarfareII,4,But now I tried to vote when I came back from work (7pm UTC+1) but I only had the option to vote for Brazil.,24
za0stf,ModernWarfareII,5,Can I even vote for Switzerland or is this another bug on the bug list this game has ?,19
za0stf,ModernWarfareII,6,They chose six matches for the contest - tomorrow’s match is Brazil v. Cameroon. If you missed your chance earlier then it’s too late.,24
za0stf,ModernWarfareII,7,"Edit: AFAIK, Switzerland was never even a part of the contest.",11
za0stf,ModernWarfareII,8,"There is no bug, COD selected 6 matches to include in this promotion, Switzerland was never one of them.",19
za0stf,ModernWarfareII,9,So no Swiss calling card or anything ?,8
za0stf,ModernWarfareII,10,"Not yet as far as I know. I’m sure they could add it in the future, but there were only 12 countries in total for this little betting game. And only the winners get their cards/anthems distributed.",37

za0stf,ModernWarfareII,13,"2 are a given (draws) and probably Argentina winning was likely, but Mexico weren't actually that low in the rankings.",20
za0stf,ModernWarfareII,14,However I didn't see Ghana and Tunisia winning.,8

za0zan,selfimprovement,1,"I thought thought by getting a good job or joining the National Guard again or getting married that I was going to be alright. That, ""This time, I'm going to be Happy and need no more."" What I've come to realize though is that I'm simply a restless human being who constantly needs to try new things and meet new people. I can't settle on working one job for the rest of my life any more because there's more to life than just that!",84
za0zan,selfimprovement,2,"Being alive and living that life, to me, means that you constantly need to reinvent yourself. Learn new skills. You can go to school, play the flute, learn how to cook, draw, work one job for a year or two and then switch to another one. Keep pushing yourself to learn and interact with other's who in turn will teach you new insights, skills, tricks, etc.",66
za0zan,selfimprovement,3,"Ever since I was a kid (I'm 37), I felt this sort of restlessness. Everyone around me always told me to get a job, marry, settle down. My first marriage was a complete fuck up (through my own actions) and my life was falling a part. Then, something within me sort of, snapped into place. Fast forward a few years and I'm just overall, happy. Sure, I fuck up here and there (again, self doing) but I think that's to remind me that I'm human . As long you keep it moving and DOING SOMETHING to better yourself as a human being and contributing to your little (or big) tribe, you'll be fine.",113

My opening balance at 1/1/22 was about $24,700 and my current balance is $26,400. My 401k allows various allocations of funds in which I have money in each: Pre-Mixed To-Go Funds, General Asset Class Funds, and Expanded Choice Funds.

za2k52,AmItheAsshole,0,AITA for going off on my sister for not taking the dog out?,13
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,1,Some back story: my sister (26F) and I (28F) grew up in an abusive household. We lost contact with eachother for almost 8 years. We reconnected almost 2 years ago and decided to move in together. During that 8 years I adopted a pitbull from an abusive and neglective environment. She came with me when I moved in with my sister.,61
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,2,So we both work full time and more often than not my sister is home hours before I am. When I leave for work I put my dog into a crate (something I hate doing but if I don't she likes to get into the garbage out of boredom). The only thing I ask of her is when she is done with her 30 minute break (We have a household policy that when you get home you take 30 minutes to yourself and relax) then take the dog out so she can do her business.,95
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,3,"For the last year, year and half roughly, my sister has gotten in the habit of getting home and getting on a game or falling asleep before taking her out. So when I get home the dog is still in her crate and there would be pee and poop in it and I'd have to clean it up.",58
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,4,"Last night was one of those nights and the dog hasn't been feeling well. So her poop is...liquid. There was poop EVERYWHERE in the crate and on the dog. I lost it. I busted my way into her room (thinking she fell asleep again so thinking I'd have to make as much noise as possible to wake her up). All I asked was if the dog has been out yet. Granted in a yelling tone. She took the dog out and when she came back in I asked her what her issue is. I don't ask her for rent, though she pays half anyways. I don't ask her to help clean, she barely does that. All I ask is for her to take the dog out. She just kept apologizing and said she lost track of time from being on her game. I'm a gamer as well but if I know something needs to be done I do that first then get online. I told her that if she can't do that then she is gonna have to have to find somewhere else to stay. Or I leave. She got mad at me calling me an asshole because she can't afford to live on her own. And that she knows she messed up but I don't need to take it that far.",222
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,5,So AITA??,2
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,6,Edit: there seems to be some confusion about if I'm the landlord. I am not. I am a tenant as much as my sister is. I paid for the deposit but that's a mute point.,35
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,7,Edit 2: if my sister walks the dog when she gets home the dog is in there for 4 or 5 hours at the most. If I walk her when I get home and she has been in the cage when I get home it's going on 9 hours at most.,51
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,8,"Edit 3: at this time dog sitters are a no go for me. I have hired people 3 times and all 3 times it was a bad experience. For both my dog, me, and the personal belongings. I am prepared to rehome her if I really must. So let's avoid making assumptions in the comments. Thank you",57
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,9,"Edit 4: I get it, ITA for having a dog while working 40 hours. Other than telling me I need to rehome her how about some suggestions on how to fix boredom. I did not go into her background because I did not feel it necessary to the original post. She was almost 3 years old when I took her in. She was not house trained whatsoever. Had no obedience training. Was not fixed nor had ever had shots since she was still a puppy. She had bite marks and still has scars from other dogs all over her. Especially on her neck and right hind leg. She is terrified of small dogs and hates big dogs. I got her trained, fixed, updated shots, and mostly house trained while still working 40 hour work weeks. The only huge issue I'm facing right now is her boredom or maybe it's anxiety. Idk. She gets into EVERYTHING if left to her own devices. At one point in particular I rushed her to a vet hospital because she thought cleaning chemicals were something to snack on. I learned my lesson on that one. I have to put her in the crate for her own safety at this point. As long as she gets walked every 5/6 hours maximum then there's no mess of any kind. No poop, pee, trash, cushions, pieces of wall anywhere.",231

za2k52,AmItheAsshole,20,"YTA and an irresponsible dog owner whose actions are *causing the abuse of your dog*. Not from your sister because it is not her responsibility, but from *you* who leave it contained for so long its defecating there. ***You should not have adopted an animal or created a situation in which you could not take care of them.***",58
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,21,Also she's a *tenant*. She pays *rent*. Have fun with the eviction process.,13
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,22,"ESH the dog should be let out as soon as the first person gets home, not 30 minutes later. The dog has already been in the crate long enough. That 30 minute rule is fine but after the dog is taken care of, not before.",45
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,23,YTA It’s your dog,4
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,24,"YTA. Get a dog walker for when you're at work, or a dog sitter, or even a better home for the poor thing, it shouldn't be created all day and I'm guessing all night too?",35
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,25,"YTA and I feel bad for your dog. Please rehome them to someone who has the time and ability to take care of them properly. A dog shouldn’t be in a crate for that long(I personally never used crates except for transporting) it’s cruel to have your dog live that way. It’s your fault your dog has to use the bathroom inside because it’s so neglected, your sister obviously isn’t interested in helping out with the dog. So sad that no one is doing right by this innocent animal.",89
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,26,"Does she live at yours rent free and part of the agreement is you look after your dog? It also sounds like the dog isn't hers it's yours. I'm kind of on the fence. If I was her out of my nature I'd look after the dog. But if it's not her responsibility, as hard as it is of a pill to swallow she doesn't owe you taking care of the dog.",72

za2k52,AmItheAsshole,29,Some back story: my sister (26F) and I (28F) grew up in an abusive household. We lost contact with eachother for almost 8 years. We reconnected almost 2 years ago and decided to move in together. During that 8 years I adopted a pitbull from an abusive and negative environment. She came with me when I moved in with my sister.,61
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,30,So we both work full time and more often than not my sister is home hours before I am. When I leave for work I put my dog into a crate (something I hate doing but if I don't she likes to get into the garbage out of boredom). The only thing I ask of her is when she is done with her 30 minute break (We have a household policy that when you get home you take 30 minutes to yourself and relax) then take the dog out so she can do her business.,95
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,31,"For the last year, year and half roughly, my sister has gotten in the habit of getting home and getting on a game or falling asleep before taking her out. So when I get home the dog is still in her crate and there would be pee and poop in it and I'd have to clean it up.",58
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,32,"Last night was one of those nights and the dog hasn't been feeling well. So her poop is...liquid. There was poop EVERYWHERE in the crate and on the dog. I lost it. I busted my way into her room (thinking she fell asleep again so thinking I'd have to make as much noise as possible to wake her up). All I asked was if the dog has been out yet. Granted in a yelling tone. She took the dog out and when she came back in I asked her what her issue is. I don't ask her for rent, though she pays half anyways. I don't ask her to help clean, she barely does that. All I ask is for her to take the dog out. She just kept apologizing and said she lost track of time from being on her game. I'm a gamer as well but if I know something needs to be done I do that first then get online. I told her that if she can't do that then she is gonna have to have to find somewhere else to stay. Or I leave. She got mad at me calling me an asshole because she can't afford to live on her own. And that she knows she messed up but I don't need to take it that far.",222
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,33,So AITA??,2
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,34,"*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*",24
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,35,You are an idiot for adopting this dog. Let her go. You are neglecting this dog. You are a terrible owner.,21
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,36,"Thank you for your input. The most she is in the crate is (if my sister walks her when she gets home) 4 or 5 hours. If she is still there when I get home it's 9 hours roughly. I hate both. I do NOT want to have her in the cage. But at this time it's the only option. I have tried training her to be ""house trained"" in a way. And we got to a place where I could leave her for an hour alone.",87
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,37,"Also I'm not a landlord. I'm a tenant as well. My sister snd I live together as tenants. Then we pay the landlord. I paid for the 2.6k$ for the deposit. And at this point I have serious doubts I'm getting it back. This place is too small for the dog but it was the only place that had no dog restrictions. I just have to pay a ""pet fee"" every month and have liability insurance and show she is fixed and is updated on her shots. I'm waiting on a promotion from my work in 4 months to be able to afford a home loan so I give this dog at least a yard to run around in. I don't want to give up something that has been with me since my lowest in my life. But I am prepared to if this promotion doesn't come to fruition.",149
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,38,I was just thinking this - my dogs go out as soon as I've set my bag down. It must be awful for that pup knowing someone is home but ignoring them.,32
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,39,ESH,1
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,40,Came here to say exactly that.,6
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,41,"You care for your animals, then you get to rest.",10
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,42,I do walk the dog as soon as I'm in the door. The dog isn't really her responsibility but I understand where you're coming from as well. And I do agree with you,33
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,43,Thank you for your input,5
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,44,"Thank you for your input. And I have looked into dog walkers and sitters. And I have had REALLY bad experiences with dog sitters. All 3 times I've hired someone I either got scammed, stolen from, or had my place be the local party house for a night. And I have been thinking seriously to just rehome her. But until then the dog is still here. And no she isn't in the crate all night. My schedule runs from 10am-7/8pm. I walk her before I leave for work, when I get home, about an hour after she eats, then one more time before I pass out for the night. 1 or 2am.",112
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,45,"So what you're saying is people who work cannot have animals? Just wanna make sure I understand you correctly. Because by your way of wording anyone who works more than 15-20 hours a week should not have pets. Or children for that matter. How do YOU suggest I help my dog from getting bored and ripping the whole house apart..AGAIN? I have tried everything from a specialist dog trainer to gross tasting sprays that ""makes puppies uninterested in chewing things"", to simply taking a trash out before I leave. This adorable dumbo thought it was a good idea to get into the cabinet where I kept (not anymore) cleaning chemicals. She almost died! I got home just in time and rushed her to the vet hospital and had her stomach pumped! She stayed there for almost a week for observation it was so bad. YOU may never had to use crates but I'm not you. And nor was I lucky enough to find this fur brain when she was still a puppy. I got her when she was almost 3 years old and she wasn't house trained! *I* got her to be house trained. Or are least to a point where she can hold it longer than she originally could. As long as she gets walked every 5/6 hours everything is fine.",222
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,46,It was the original agreement that she wouldn't have to pay rent if she walks the dog a few times during the day. She decided on her own to pay half the rent when she got a pay raise. So she sends me money through zelle. But she said she'd still walk the dog when she gets home. And I agree it's not her responsibility. I'm just one of those that does what they say they are gonna do. If that makes sense. We are gonna talk about it when I get home tonight. But I'm just seeing if maybe I messed up our relationship too far over this..if that makes sense. Just so I have an idea on how I should talk to her.,125
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,47,"Even if the dog is not her responsibility, she should have a big enough heart to attend to the dog if needed. Dogs are family. I'm glad you prioritise your pooch when you get home.",35
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,48,"…yes, anyone who is not available to take care of their pets should not have them. your dog almost DIED and you are somehow spinning that story to make yourself out to be the hero that saved her, not the ignorant fool who put her in that position.",48
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,49,wow looks like some of your family members behaviour has rubbed off on you. do you understand how dogs work or how children work? you don’t deserve a dog really. YOU have no time for a dog that especially needs it. you’re a selfish person and making yourself a victim in a situation you created and are here barking at people for being right and honest to you. why should someone who has no time for children have kids anyway? are you dumb? you are trying to paint yourself as a good and failing bc ur just describing awful shit your dog is going through because of your neglect and lack of time. dogs are like toddlers and a full time job. if you cared for this dog you’d give it to someone who can actually care for it. your dog almost died because of YOU you are no hero. you’re a dog abuser.,154
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,50,I think her paying rent was a way to communicate that she can no longer take the dog for walks. Maybe you should find an alternative for your pet. Understandably she could be exhausted herself after work.,37
za2k52,AmItheAsshole,51,I can see she's tried to make things right by paying rent now she has more of an income. I'd say have a conversation about it ☺️,27
za33q5,Aliexpress,0,Seller taking too long to send the product,8
za33q5,Aliexpress,1,"25/11 i bought a graphics card on cpu top store, and it still not been sent by the seller, is this normal? What should i do? I already contacted the seller and I said I need the graphics card to be sent before December, then they said they are going to send as soon as possible, it still not sent. Idk what to do, and i need this graphics card in my pc before January. Btw I'm from Brazil",79
za33q5,Aliexpress,2,"This is why you shouldn’t buy stuff you will need within 4 months on Ali, especially with all the corona lockdowns going on there.",24
za33q5,Aliexpress,3,Besides that you shouldn’t buy PC parts on there either the chance you won’t get what you ordered is gigantic.,20
za33q5,Aliexpress,4,I believe they have to send within a few days and if they don’t it will get canceled automatically. Otherwise if they generated a shipping label you will have to wait until the date it should have been delivered.,39
za33q5,Aliexpress,5,"Similar situation with 2 orders of mine, they face a lot of issues with logistics and having orders shipped due to lockdowns.",22
za33q5,Aliexpress,6,But regardless you should never ever rely on the delivery date on such long shipments. Usually aliexpress gives a 2 month period for the items to be delivered before you can ask for a refund. This shows how much an order can take to arrive and I believe that this is an optimistic scenario as well.,56

za33q5,Aliexpress,11,"Update: i know nobody cares, but i would like to update it here: my graphics card is already installed on my pc for about a month and damn, WHAT A BEAST. The shipping time was 1 month or less, just as expected, to Brazil, things are shipped faster, apparently.",49
za33q5,Aliexpress,12,I had one order that was automatically cancelled and the money was refunded after 1 week when the seller failed to ship the item. I have another order that was supposedly shipped on Nov 27th yet as of Dec 1st there is no tracking showing it was ever picked up by the carrier.,53
za33q5,Aliexpress,13,"In my region, AliExpress shipping takes around a month, so it would be no problem for me, i didn't know China was having corona lockdowns until now, thanks",28
za33q5,Aliexpress,14,After 15 days of no movement on the tracking Aliexpress will automatically cancel.,13
za33q5,Aliexpress,15,Take into consideration that there’s a very complicated situation in china currently and your seller may not be able to ship in the time you need it.,27
za39al,antidepressants,0,Just switched from Pristiq to Fetzima,6
za39al,antidepressants,1,"During the three weeks that I was on Pristiq, my already severe depression and anxiety were worse, and I was having an increased amounts of suicidal thoughts amongst other not being able to sleep, etc. Coming off of 50mg after my doctor took me off it a few days ago whilst waiting for Fetzima to be approved, I've been trying be hopeful that it'll help.",65
za39al,antidepressants,2,"I take my first dose tonight and I'm wondering what your guys' experience with Fetzima for depression, or anxiety, if it helps anxiety. I'd love to actually find an antidepressant that works and doesn't make me feel worse.",38
za39al,antidepressants,3,Curious how your switch went and how you went about it. Thinking about switching to Fetzima myself as Pristiq doesn’t seem like it’s strong enough.,25
za39al,antidepressants,4,"Insurance wouldn't cover Fetzima, but they covered Effexor, which I was on for a month but the negatives of it took away from the good it was doing. I'm on Celexa now and it's working well, side-effects aren't as bad as they were as Effexor, and I'm getting adjusted to it.",51
za39al,antidepressants,5,"To answer your question, I was only on Pristiq for three weeks before the increased depression, anxiety, and paranoia convinced my doctor to take me off of it. That was a nightmare I don't want to relive.",37

za3d3q,toddlers,1,"Y'all, what a cutie! The way she reached her neck out like a turtle to find the wiggle straw and get it into her mouth after a little struggle followed by the joy in her eyes after she succeeded and then losing the straw and using her tongue to try to get it back towards her mouth. Just... Lol. So fun to witness. Made my day.",66

za4b3k,pagan,0,I worship Artemis but I'm interested in also worshiping Aphrodite can I?,12
za4b3k,pagan,1,And how would it work? I know those two do not get along,13
za4b3k,pagan,2,"What makes you think that any two Gods ""do not get along""?",12
za4b3k,pagan,3,What makes you think that you can only worship one God or Goddess at a time?,16
za4b3k,pagan,4,Most people in antiquity would have worshiped both Goddesses without any issues at all.,14
za4b3k,pagan,5,"Myths aren't literal. In fact myths which show on a surface level an antagonism or rivalry between Gods in myths is often interpreted as showing a relationship between the Gods. (eg the Myth of Athena and Poseidon feuding over who gets to be Patron of Athens shows a relationship where both were celebrated at festivals side by side in Athens, as well as being a historical remembrance that Poseidon was likely an important patron of Athens during the days when it had Kings as Poseidon is related to Kingship, and Athena more to democracy.)",94
za4b3k,pagan,6,Look at what Euripides had Heracles say about the myths in the 5th Century BCE.,15
za4b3k,pagan,7,">In any case, I don’t believe any of it. I don’t believe that the gods engage is such unholy relationships, nor have I never believed this story about gods tying up their parents in chains and I won’t believe it now.",41
za4b3k,pagan,8,>Nor can I ever believe that one god is the lord of another.,13
za4b3k,pagan,9,">A god, if he is a real god, is in need of nothing. These are just miserable tales made up by poets.",22
za4b3k,pagan,10,Artemis was historically called on to aid in an easy childbirth. The works of Aphrodite are usually involved in the conception of said children. Why should the two goddesses not get along?,32
za4b3k,pagan,11,"Myths shouldn’t be taken literally, and there’s more to both of these goddesses than the myths.",16
za4b3k,pagan,12,"You can worship any combination of deities that you like. As has already been mentioned, we Hellenists usually don't take myths literally. So there's no need for concern about whether you can worship these two deities together. You can.",39
za4b3k,pagan,13,Considering that the Greeks and Romans worshipped like 15+ gods as whole cultures I don't see why not.,18
za4b3k,pagan,14,"Yeah, they're polytheistic gods so you can worship as many of them as you want to. That's what people have always done.",22
za4b3k,pagan,15,I mean I worship both Odin and Loki in the Norse Parthenon and those two didn't really get along in the end,22
za4b3k,pagan,16,I feel as if 75-90% of goddesses have to do with childbirth.,12
za4y25,Marriage,0,Throwaway. Just need to vent and get some advice.,9
za4y25,Marriage,1,"TLDR; 34m and 34f(me) married 10 years, together 14 years, confused about whether to divorce, whether I'm the problem, and like the title says, just looking to vent and get advice.",31
za4y25,Marriage,2,"(Reading this back after writing and it's so unorganized and chaotic, So sorry to anyone who reads this lol)",19
za4y25,Marriage,3,"I'll start from the beginning, since I think this is where a lot of our issues stem from.",18
za4y25,Marriage,4,"We worked together first, and became friends. He was dating someone at the time, who he'd been with since high school, they had their share of issues, and they broke up. We started dating, and it moved pretty quickly. I was basically living with him at this point, partially because we just enjoyed being together but also I had terrible anxiety and admittedly felt possessive over him. I knew they were still talking. He lied to me about going to see a friend to get him out of a bad situation with his ""alcoholic dad"", went to spend the night with her instead, and he still, to this day, will not tell me the truth. The only reason I know what actually happened is because she told me, and that the friend with the alcoholic dad is a family friend, and he is in fact not an alcoholic.",148
za4y25,Marriage,5,"Very early on I feel like I was pushing him into the next phase of our relationship. Getting our first place together, buying a ring, proposing... all of that I feel like I pushed him to do when maybe he wasn't ready? He did all of it, of course, he didn't have to, I never forced him. But he was never passionate. He went to my parents to ask for their ""permission"" (something we don't believe in now, but we were youngish), but didn't actually do it. Didn't plan a big proposal when he knew I wanted that, Just... didn't put thought into those things. I was fine with that because I thought maybe it just wasn't him, and I accepted him as he was. Looking back now though it does upset me.",133
za4y25,Marriage,6,"There were lots of things that bothered me though. He is very passive, doesn't make decisions, doesn't take initiative, things I didn't think were a big deal so I took the lead on most things in our life. I decided where we lived, our budgets, I took on the ""mental load"". I was fine with it. In the beginning he worked very long hours at a physically challenging job, and even though I was working full time, I was glad to do all of those things.",86
za4y25,Marriage,7,"From very early on, I knew he lacked emotional intimacy. There weren't many emotional conversations. No cuddling just to cuddle. No words of affirmation (or any of the other love languages for that matter lol). Everything was ""fine"" always. DOn't get me wrong. He is a great man. But I'd say, very emotionally immature. Again, it wasn't an issue before because we didn't have any ""real"" responsibilities - car payments, kids, pets, etc. And I didn't need the emotional support, emotional intimacy, communication, etc.",84
za4y25,Marriage,8,"Since we've had kids, we have two (7 and 2), these things are bigger issues for me. Taking on the mental load is more difficult when we have kids and pets. For the longest time, I was doing all the cleaning, planning, cooking, etc. Then he started a different job that was way less hours, not physically demanding, and he could be home more. He didn't pick up any slack or chores or anything. We talked, he reluctantly agreed to start doing more around the house. Which is great, I'm thankful. BUT, I still have to initiate the tasks most of the time, unless it effects him directly (like laundry). We tried the Fair Play game, that helped a bit, but again, I felt like I was forcing him to participate. Dragging him along. With the kids, I'm the one planning and executing outings, and then I have to drag him out to come with us.",156
za4y25,Marriage,9,"I have no emotional support when it comes to the kids. I am the one that makes rules, bedtimes, pushes showers and teeth brushing. Makes appointments. Remembers vaccines, clothing sizes... When something goes wrong, he turns it around on me and it's my fault. But then I feel set up because he won't make decisions or help out, so of course it's my fault because he doesn't do anything. He won't apologize. Ever. At all. He wrestles with our oldest and doesn't stop when he asks. Doesn't apologize if oldest is hurt. Is just cruel sometimes with us.He claims our son lies about things, stupid things, and then doesn't apologize when he's proven wrong. He does not praise or acknowledge good work from the kids or me. It's like he only has negative thoughts, assumes the worst, etc. Doesn't thank anyone. I can't disagree with him at all.",148
za4y25,Marriage,10,"His biggest gripe is that we aren't physically intimate enough. Anytime I try to talk about our issues, the issues I have, he says he would be happier, more active in our lives, if we had more sx.",38
za4y25,Marriage,11,"For a long time after our marriage, I thought I was asexual. I had no desire or urge at all. But I'm learning that all of these things that I thought didn't matter, that I ignored, actually do matter to me. And they push me away from him. I don't feel respected. I don't feel loved (I asked him during our last serious conversation whether he still loved me. He said he ""tries to love"" me. etc?). I don't feel appreciated. I'm learning that I can't force myself to be physical in a relationship that doesn't have those things. Yes, I've communicated all of this with him. He said he didn't know how, or what to do, or that he was already giving his all. I take 100% of the responsibility on this. I don't want him to be in a relationship that the's not fulfilled in, and it is 100% my fault that we aren't sexual. I knew all of these things were issues before we were married, and I ignored them. That's on me.",176
za4y25,Marriage,12,"At the same time though, I keep hearing ""If he wanted to, he would."" If he loved me, cared for me, appreciated me, he would be making an effort.",29
za4y25,Marriage,13,There is no effort.,4
za4y25,Marriage,14,"I know I am also at fault in this relationship situation. Don't get me wrong. I have ADHD, Anxiety, depression, I'm terrible at managing money and budgets. I have my own issues. But I do try. So hard. I'm in therapy. I'm on meds. I'm really trying.",47
za4y25,Marriage,15,"But I'm fucking exhausted of feeling like I'm the only one trying here. If all of these red flags that I ignored 14 years ago still exist, I can't expect him to change to become what I need.",38
za4y25,Marriage,16,"But, we have kids. I still have hope that things will get better.",13
za4y25,Marriage,17,But they haven't got better. Am I the shitty one here? Can I just get some input? Validation? Or slap me with some reality? Being an adult really fucking sucks.,30
za4y25,Marriage,18,My thoughts are.,3
za4y25,Marriage,19,"His ex might have been the love of his life fantasy type of thing. He essentially was dating you and slept with his ex, possibly in hopes of something becoming more again. Not nice. But you need to let go of the past and it was 14 years ago. He does seem to have a lot of issues though.",59
za4y25,Marriage,20,Sounds like he's not feeling it and neither are you. It's unlikely he will change and it's unlikely you will want to jump into bed with him. Does that mean divorce? Probably not.,33
za4y25,Marriage,21,"I think you need some self-care outside of this constellation. Pick up some hobbies, concentrate on that. You need to stop caring so much, analysing and picking up the slack, He complains about you doing too much, not enough, not perfect enough, it needs to go over your head and he needs to step up and you slow down.",59
za4y25,Marriage,22,"He will likely not change. He seems really reactive and that's probably the turn off for you sexually, it's not that you're asexual, it's that you're not connected.",28
za4y25,Marriage,23,So here's what you do:,5
za4y25,Marriage,24,"Since he's reactive maybe just love him for who he is and accept him. Warts and all. If you can manage that, great! If you can't, you need to learn this for yourself.",33
za4y25,Marriage,25,"Sex can only come with connection. He has hobbies? Let him carry them out, leave him be. If he wants to hang out with you, ok, watch his movies, eat the foods he likes. Find his jokes funny again. If not, the grown man has friends and you go live his life.",52
za4y25,Marriage,26,"But there's no give without take. He needs to do more things he's good at, maybe cleaning, maybe task, without you telling him to. You need to take whatever you feel you need.",33
za4y25,Marriage,27,"You can do loads to build a connection without giving in to sex. Sex will come with a decent connection and once it feel natural again, things will start on a better foot than now.",35

za599y,TTC_PCOS,0,Anyone else starting letrozole this cycle?,6
za599y,TTC_PCOS,1,I’ll be starting it in roughly 16 days and would love a cycle buddy 😅 I’m so nervous and hopeful!,20
za599y,TTC_PCOS,2,Any tips or tricks are appreciated!,6
za599y,TTC_PCOS,3,"I will be starting it as soon as I get my period (CD 3-7), which should be any day now! Fingers crossed for you too!",25
za599y,TTC_PCOS,4,"Starting second round tonight! Last month I found the side effects are fine, little bit dizzy, but the impact of the progesterone after ovulation if you’re not used to it is WILD. Hot sweats for DAYS.",36
za599y,TTC_PCOS,5,I’m hopefully starting it Saturday after baseline ultrasound/labs! 🤞,9
za599y,TTC_PCOS,6,In the TWW on my first round!,7
za599y,TTC_PCOS,7,I’m 5 days post my last dose of my first round x,12
za599y,TTC_PCOS,8,I’m starting it in roughly 2 weeks too! Cycle twins!,10
za599y,TTC_PCOS,9,"I am! I’ll be starting my second round, I didn’t ovulate on my first round of 2.5mg so they’ve upped the dosage to 5mg for next cycle. I’m just waiting to get my period now. Good luck to you!!",39
za599y,TTC_PCOS,10,Me!! On day 3 of Provera right now to induce a period.,12
za599y,TTC_PCOS,11,I am on my 2nd round of IUI with donor sperm (31F lesbian) and was on 2.5mg of letrazole last month.,21
za599y,TTC_PCOS,12,I’m doing IUI again and taking 2.5 letrazole every night this week and then hopefully doing my trigger shot (ovidrel) if I get a mature follicle next week!,28
za599y,TTC_PCOS,13,I’m on my second cycle now! Had a 22mm follicle and took the trigger on Wednesday. Fingers crossed 🤞🏽🤞🏽,19
za599y,TTC_PCOS,14,It’s a really easy process just make sure to document every single symptom you get. I believe a lot of my side affects I was taking as pregnancy symptoms and convinced myself I was pregnant and was crushed after round 1.,41
za599y,TTC_PCOS,15,I started tonight for my first round with it!,9
za599y,TTC_PCOS,16,Starting my first round hopefully in the next week or so (waiting for AF to show up after a round of provera). Here’s hoping things go smoothly for all of us!!,31
za599y,TTC_PCOS,17,I was supposed to but my clinic didn’t send my prescription in time! 😭,14
za599y,TTC_PCOS,18,Me! This is my last day taking it. It’s been good except for a little bit of digestive upset.,19
za599y,TTC_PCOS,19,30 weeks pregnant after one found if 5mg Letrozole for 5 days! Good luck,14
za599y,TTC_PCOS,20,Started letrozole today!I go in on Saturday to get my follicles checked.,12
za599y,TTC_PCOS,21,Having the worst period migraine since yesterday. Once I took letrozole I had a nap and now feeling much better,20
za599y,TTC_PCOS,22,Finished my Letrozole on Tuesday. I have a ultrasound tomorrow to see follicle size,14
za599y,TTC_PCOS,23,Starting a new round soon with increased dose. Also doing some testing since RE is concerned that my luteal phase is too long.,23
za599y,TTC_PCOS,24,"Second cycle! First cycle 5 days of 5mg, failed to produce a mature follicle, took three additional days and didn’t progress at all so the cycle was cancelled. On my third day at 7.5, hoping and praying it succeeds.",39
za599y,TTC_PCOS,25,I started taking it from day 8. Im really worried if that's okay. My doctor she just told me to start it. Didn't tell me that it should be taken from day 3.,33
za599y,TTC_PCOS,26,Good luck!!! I’m sending lots of baby dust,8
za599y,TTC_PCOS,27,I’m in the same exact boat! Last day of provera tomorrow. Fingers crossed. COVID messed with my last medicated cycle so hopefully this one works!!,25
za599y,TTC_PCOS,28,I’m so so interested to see how it impacts me. Thank you for this!,14
za599y,TTC_PCOS,29,That’s so exciting! Crossing fingers for you,7
za599y,TTC_PCOS,30,I felt sick on day 3 and quite unwell but then got better and have just felt hotter,18
za599y,TTC_PCOS,31,How did you feel from it?,6
za599y,TTC_PCOS,32,Ahhhhh yay! I hope it’s a successful round for you guys,11
za599y,TTC_PCOS,33,Good luck!! I hope it all works out,8
za599y,TTC_PCOS,34,I’m on roughly the same schedule! Trigger shot Monday and mildly panicking now because the tww is just the worst.,20
za599y,TTC_PCOS,35,"I’m starting my first night tomorrow, first round, cycle buddy :)",11
za599y,TTC_PCOS,36,Noooooo! I’m so sorry 😞,5
za599y,TTC_PCOS,37,Fingers crossed for you!,4
za599y,TTC_PCOS,38,How long is the LP for you? I’m having similar concerns,11
za599y,TTC_PCOS,39,Thank you! ☺️❤️,3
za599y,TTC_PCOS,40,Thank you! I hope it works for you as well!,10
za599y,TTC_PCOS,41,Yes - I have cried several times today imagine myself holding a negative test. I can take it but gotta give myself something to look forward to.,27
za599y,TTC_PCOS,42,I’m literally working right now to keep my mind off of it 😭😭,13
za599y,TTC_PCOS,43,How are you feeling about it?? I get such anxiety when I start a new med lol,17
za599y,TTC_PCOS,44,Like 16-18 days I think. She said could be a sign of very early loss (I’m not as sure since I’ve been taking pregnancy tests tho?). She said it should be 14 days between the positive OPK and the new cycle,41
za599y,TTC_PCOS,45,feel free to message if you need to rant/could use support! seems like our timelines are pretty similar :) my CD1 is expected in the next week-10 days,28
za599y,TTC_PCOS,46,Feeling cautiously optimistic. I’m sure my mind will spiral soon enough though. I was frustrated and down cause I thought provera didn’t even work to give me a period to start this cycle. Never been so happy to see my period. Just want to get things started really - sick of not even ovulating and being able to try,59
za599y,TTC_PCOS,47,i’m with you on this! i feel like i haven’t even had a shot at trying yet. but i’m also worried about all the stress of then ‘actually’ ttc. i think i’ll be needing provera to start mine so i can then start the medicated cycle process. good luck to you!,51
za599y,TTC_PCOS,48,"I know, it’s going to be a real lesson in patience. Waiting for (hopefully) ovulation, then the tww, then provera again, repeat. I’m hoping doing some yoga helps my stress.",30

za5cla,migraine,0,Gabapentin is weird (for me),5
za5cla,migraine,1,"My doctor told me it would just make me sleepy, but it made me suddenly gain weight and made my face puffy, as well as no help at all. Has anyone else had bad experience with it?",37
za5cla,migraine,2,"It made me feel like I was drunk-drunk. Felt like I was moving around underwater and dizzy. I was prescribed it for nerve pain but only ever took it once. That was more than enough for me. I do know the other commenter is absolutely right about the withdrawals, I've seen many people go through it. I hope you find something that helps, but if it makes you feel weird and makes your face swell this probably isn't it.",79
za5cla,migraine,3,If you don't like it wean off as soon as possible. It's hands down the worst withdrawal I've ever gone through. Worse than benzos withdrawal. I was on 900mg 3x day for about six months. Near the end I thought I was losing my mind. The brain fog was so intense and my vision was awful.,56
za5cla,migraine,4,"100 mg 2x day chilled me out and helped some with blurry vision. 200 mg 2x day knocked me out with exhaustion. I gained ~5 lbs in the 3 months I was on gaba, and my face was puffy as well. I stopped taking it because it made my tits hurt so fucking bad hahaha. Looked it up and in like 1% of people it causes severe breast pain. Of course I was in the 1%. Overall, even if it only helped my auras a little, I loved gaba for my anxiety.",92
za5cla,migraine,5,Those are known side effects.,5
za5cla,migraine,6,"They gave me 300 mg and it knocked me out. Then, 100 mg which didn’t do anything.",17
za5cla,migraine,7,Omg is that why my face is puffy? Did it go away for y'all?,14
za5cla,migraine,8,"I'm on gaba... Made me ""stupid"" in the begining. But your body adjusts. Weight gain can be a side effect. Not sure about the puffy face tho. Give Dr a call maybe. The withdrawals from it aren't fun... I've done it twice .. but it's better than say Lyrica. If you can try to give the med a chance otherwise move onto the next option.",65
za5cla,migraine,9,"Yup, crap medicine for migraine. A GP put me on it for a while until I complained it did not help and made me feel awful. That and Topamax should not be prescribed for migraine, ever, in my opinion, but what do I know :/",45
za5cla,migraine,10,Exactly what happened to me. Took it once and never again. Dr listed it as one of my allergies,19
za5cla,migraine,11,Ooh that might be why my tits hurt too lol,10
za5cla,migraine,12,"That's interesting but makes sense. I have known a few people over the years that took it for fun, which I think is crazy on many levels. I never thought about it being an allergy.",35
za5cla,migraine,13,Basically just means they won’t ever prescribe it again and it will alert them in the system,17
za5r4a,disability,0,Does anyone know how to train your own pet to be a service dog?,14
za5r4a,disability,1,I wanted to have a Service Dog for my heart rate since I tend to forget bodily pain (?) and tend to pass out and have no one around me at most times,33
za5r4a,disability,2,"The first step is to have the pet dog you're wanting to train evaluated by a canine behavioralist or a professional trainer who's experienced in service dog training to see if they have potential as a candidate. It is much more likely for a dog to not have the right temperament for service work than it is for them to be suited for it, and because training is so incredibly expensive and takes so long (usually around 2 years), you don't want to be starting out with a prospect that has no chance of succeeding. That's why it's important to get an evaluation first, before you start investing time and money into training.",113
za5r4a,disability,3,"If this current dog is a suitable prospect, the next step would be to get set up with a trainer who can help you through the process.",27
za5r4a,disability,4,"If this current dog is not a suitable prospect, whether that's because of temperament, behavioral habits, age, etc, the next step would be to acquire a new prospect and to potentially figure out a rehoming option for your current dog if owning two dogs at once isn't possible for you.",50
za5r4a,disability,5,"Something else to keep in mind is that if you're looking for a dog to be a cardiac alert service dog, your best bet is to get a service dog from a program as opposed to owner training one. Cardiac alerts are currently not thought to be a type of alert that can be trained and instead require a natural ability from the dog. If cardiac alert is a task that you need a service dog to perform, getting a program dog is a much safer bet because then you know that dog will be able to do that task as opposed to rolling the dice and hoping the dog you attempt to owner train ends up able to do it.",121
za5r4a,disability,6,"Well, I can tell you this: it's allowed. There's no rule about who can and can't train a service animal, no certifications or licenses involved. And, there's no tests or anything for an animal you've trained to count.",38
za5r4a,disability,7,"However, consider your position: you're asking Reddit how to train a dog to do something with your life in the balance. That screams ""bad idea.""",25
za5r4a,disability,8,"If you want to do this, first you have to train yourself to learn how to train dogs, and familiarize yourself with the process of training a service animal, and then re-visit this.",33
za5r4a,disability,9,"Until then, I'd suggest a medical alert system with fall detection as a stopgap",14
za5r4a,disability,10,"I have experience with service dogs and ""service dog trainers."" The rules regarding service dogs are extremely flexible (too much so; bad people often take advantage of them)",28
za5r4a,disability,11,"My advice based on my experience: work with a dog that has a very good bond with you. The closer you are to him/her, the more likely that he/she will be in-tune with your body",35
za5r4a,disability,12,You don't have to formally train a dog for him/her to be aware of your body.,16
za5r4a,disability,13,"If you're in an emergency state- that dog will *take care of you,* instinctively",14
za5r4a,disability,14,"While training with a professional trainer isn’t required, you do still have to train a dog to do tasks. The vast majority of dogs aren’t just going to instinctively do task work simply because they have a bond with their owner like your saying they will.",46
za5r4a,disability,15,"And even if a dog does happen to have a natural alert or response, it doesn’t legally count as a task unless that natural alert/response is then shaped and reinforced as the ADA specifically states it has to be trained.",40
za5r4a,disability,16,"""the vast majority of dogs aren't just going to instinctively do task work"" - this particular person mentioned that they pass out. Not every dog would respond well to task work like ""press emergency button,"" but any dog would start barking its head off at the sight of its owner passed out on the ground",55
za5r4a,disability,17,"I guess I was trying to think more flexibly like ""how can a person own a dog that can help save their life - without having to 'train it' according to ADA standards""",33
za5r4a,disability,18,"No actually the majority of dogs won’t do that either. They may be slightly concerned or scared at first and then ignore/move away from their owner or even attempt to initiate play, but barking isn’t something a lot dogs will do in that situation. Especially not with the actual purpose of getting attention.",53
za5r4a,disability,19,"That type of thing must either be shaped or trained. And OP was specifically asking about having their pet dog become a service dog, which would need to meet the ADA definition and requirements to be a service dog. If it isn’t trained to that then it isn’t a service dog.",51
za5r4a,disability,20,Ugh whatever I still have my viewpoint based on my experience and you have yours. Have a good one,19
za5r4a,disability,21,Literally - tasks must be trained in order to count. Full stop. A bond and 'natural reactions' do not meet the legal definition of a service dog.,27
za5r4a,disability,22,"I ""know* the tasks are required so a dog can legally be considered a service animal",16
za5r4a,disability,23,"But in my experience, dog trainers often don't understand the disabled person's needs (and therefore they don't understand the tasks that they need to train the dog)",27
za5r4a,disability,24,"Personally, I don't think we need to train complicated tasks because when we develop strong bonds with animals, they can sense when we're in a medical emergency",27
za5r4a,disability,25,It's ok to disagree. Lol,5
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,0,Concerned my girlfriend may have a shopping addiction,8
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,1,My girlfriend (22) has been living with my family and I for almost a year. I am beginning to suspect she has a shopping addiction.,25
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,2,"She currently has a couple thousand dollars in credit card debt and has taken out about $9k in several personal loans (with sky high interest, which she has used to pay off her past credit card debt). She also has been maxing out her student loans every semester to pay on her credit cards. (To make matters worse, she isn’t doing very well grade-wise but refuses to change her major to something more suited to her) She goes on large shopping sprees every couple weeks buying makeup, clothes and shoes. Our bedroom is overflowing with all her purchases, a lot of which she only wears a couple times.",108
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,3,She doesn’t have the greatest job either and only works part-time. She also bought a brand new vehicle for $25k on which the payment and insurance eats up over half of her income.,33
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,4,"I love her but I’m finding it hard to wrap my head around what she does. I’m concerned that we will never be able to get a place of our own due to her debt-to-income ratio, let alone be able to one day buy a house.",46
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,5,"Am I overreacting? If not, is there anything I can do to support her and help her see that this isn’t sustainable?",22
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,6,"You don't even have your own place, she's blowing money, and taking out loans with high interest???",17
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,7,"Ruh oh! You need to talk to her and set your priorities...if you live with family you do everything you can to be independent and I've been there. I don't like having to rely on anyone else, ever.",38
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,8,"Also, don't do anything stupid before you get this sorted. If she's not willing to adapt I guess is the word I'll use this may be a problem you have to live with for the rest of your life, unless divorce.",41
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,9,"Certainly tell her how this is affecting you. Sometimes people don't realize there is a problem until they are told. See if you can help her come up with a plan to get back on track and get to a better financial state. Being in college is hard, and it looks like she may not have developed the skills to manage money prior to college. A lot of people (including myself) have been there. Try not to demean her or talk down to her -- the world is set up in a way that is designed to make people like her continue what she is doing, in order to maximize profit off of her.",114
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,10,"Remember that it is a gradual process -- you won't see progress overnight. She might have to take the time to see a therapist, if there is something that she is trying to compensate for.",35
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,11,"But remember first and foremost, that she has to be willing to help herself. If you express how you feel and she doesn't seem to take it seriously, use that information for your next move.",35
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,12,"All good advice here, I just wanted to add when you do approach her don’t do so from an accusatory place. It sounds like she’s dealing with a lot mentally (addiction is all about filling a void), and she may see it as an attack and crawl deeper into the hole. Be firm but gentle, and show her how you can help her too",64
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,13,"If she has a shopping addiction, she may need therapy to address the issues, as for some they get a high from shopping, or it helps ease stress. On top of that she is young, and might not have received proper financial guidance earlier on in her life.",48
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,14,"Your concerns are valid and I suggest you present them to her in the kindest way possible, that you are worried for her and your future together.",27
za63pm,shoppingaddiction,15,"Even too, what is her social media usage like? Is she being easily swayed by influencers?",16

For a variety of reasons that I won't get into on this post (trying to remain as anonymous as possible), we can't split the large group up into smaller groups.",84
za6y2w,socialwork,2,"Some clients participate and are supportive of others as they share, but the majority of the group are doing their own thing. Some of them sleep, some are on their phones, some are having sidebar conversations unrelated to the group topics, etc. We've tried collaborating with clients to create group norms, and we've tried using topic suggestions from our clients in hopes that it'll appeal to the group's interests.",69
za6y2w,socialwork,3,"Although I'm not a huge fan of the sleepers, it's the disruptive behaviors that bug me. I certainly don't want to force anyone to engage in therapy if they dont want to, but at the very least I'd like the clients that don't want to share to at least be quiet and/or observant. I've had clients come up to me after group and express their frustrations, which I certainly understand. I feel responsible because I've been unsuccessful at keeping the group from getting rowdy.",84
za6y2w,socialwork,4,So here are my questions:,5
za6y2w,socialwork,5,1) has anyone here ever facilitated group therapy for 30+ people with success?,13
za6y2w,socialwork,6,"2) if you were successful, what did you do to make it work?",13
za6y2w,socialwork,7,Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.,5

I've been told by a friend that I should try to ""keep the peace"" and ""be friends"" because I have to live with them, but tbh, (1) I've never blamed them. I gave many warnings and stated that it had everything to do with ME being anxious about the door being unlocked. And (2) if someone gets this mad/rude over someone setting a simple boundary, then why would I want them as a friend. As a roommate friendship isn't my priority; respect for each other (and each other's boundaries) is most important.

za79i9,AmItheAsshole,37,"NTA. You were clear that leaving the door unlocked made you uncomfortable and what you'd do if they kept leaving it unlocked. You gave them multiple chances and they didn't care sbout your feelings enough to change their actions, so they can biy their own TV if they want one in the common room. My college roommate drove me nuts because she refused to lock our dorm room, even when she'd leave for class. I've watched too many true crime shows to not double check that my doors are always locked. I'd tell your roommates you're just trying to make sure you all don't end up like the 4 college students that were just murdered in Idaho USA in an off campus house. They sound like they could use a scare to learn to be more responsible.",137
za79i9,AmItheAsshole,38,"NTA this is beyond worrying about just a TV, this is a major safety hazard. I can't imagine being a person who's just ok with the front door being unlocked at 4am, especially after being told many times it makes a roommate anxious. You did all you needed to let them know what was going to happen, they're the ones who didn't bother to either listen or care. If your bedroom doesn't have a lock I'd maybe invest in one.",80

za79i9,AmItheAsshole,41,"NTA, though I'm kinda curious about this part. They woke up to the TV being gone, and then they just calmly asked you about it when you woke up?

za7z94,Screenwriting,1,This is the first time I’ve posted here. Please be gentle guys.,12
za7z94,Screenwriting,2,"I’ve been writing scripts here and there for years but never had any luck selling them. So I decided to narrow my focus and write something that would be easier to film. No car chases or creature effects. Also I personally love high concept, cerebral ideas so I decided to write a High Concept Low Budget horror screenplay…",58
za7z94,Screenwriting,3,And it worked! I sold it and it’s In post production now. I think I want to keep writing in this format and see if I can do it again. Kinda make it my thing.,35
za7z94,Screenwriting,4,I’m hoping to hear from other writers about if they tailor their writing to fit into a certain style or if they hope to make a name for themselves by writing a screenplays of only types.,36
za7z94,Screenwriting,5,"Also any other writers who write similar screenplays, what have been your experiences. Did it make it easier to sell for you?",22
za7z94,Screenwriting,6,Congrats to you!,3
za7z94,Screenwriting,7,"I don't really do the Hollywood thing anymore. Did that back in the 80s and 90s. These days, at my age, I love writing simple, character-driven low budget movies for independent producers. The pay is not great, certainly not by Hollywood standards, but the movies get made. A movie I wrote last year is in post now. I can't wait to see it.",63
za7z94,Screenwriting,8,Sounds like you got a good plan working for you. Wishing you continued success.,14
za7z94,Screenwriting,9,That’s basically the Blumhouse model. Jason has wondered out loud why others aren’t adopting it.,15

za7z94,Screenwriting,11,"Right now I’m working on a comedy pilot that, after looking at the pitch deck, said he “can’t think of a more complicated comedy” but that “the script could be great.” Another producer read the script and said it was “hilarious and like It’s Always Sunny meets Half Baked” so the complexity of it seems to range.",57
za7z94,Screenwriting,12,But writing something simple yet fucking bonkers is so fun and uninhabiting.,12
za7z94,Screenwriting,13,Congrats on selling the script! I can’t wait to see a post when it finally comes out!,17

za7z94,Screenwriting,17,Think about the economics of that and figure out if it's sustainable. How long did it take to write the script? How much did you get paid for it? How many would you need to write in a year (and sell) to quit your day job?,46

za7z94,Screenwriting,30,I have a thriller/horror that has less than ten characters and takes place over one night at a ranch. A friend who read a draft said it’s almost like a play and there are a few things that may be a bit effect heavy like a fire and cattle being wrangled.,51

za7z94,Screenwriting,33,if it's your passion then every dollar is well worth it bud. if you don't mind me asking what are the numbers like when selling for a low budget film,30
za7z94,Screenwriting,34,A real 10 grand is worth a lot more than an imaginary 10 million,14
za7z94,Screenwriting,35,"Unlike Hollywood where writer rates are dictated by the Writers Guild, low budget independent prices depend on what you're willing to work for - and what you can get. Five grand, ten grand, twenty grand. Whatever. It just depends. Sometimes you work cheap in the hopes the movie will take off and take you with it.",56
za7z94,Screenwriting,36,"One director asked me if he could shoot one of my horror screenplays in exchange for part of the profits (if any and there won't be. LOL!). I said, sure.

za7z94,Screenwriting,37,Hope that helps.,3
za7z94,Screenwriting,38,That's very true. I was more talking low-budget vs. ultra low budget. I'll write a horror movie for 10k. Not gonna write one for $300 or something.,27

za9cjk,Fosterparents,0,Submitted our application today. Excited and nervous.,7
za9cjk,Fosterparents,1,"My wife works in a local elementary school and has worked with a boy for the last 2 years who has been in the system since birth, in and out of foster homes, family homes etc..The kid has had no stable place to stay and lives out of a suitcase. After 2 years of working with him daily, my wife asked if he could live with us, she said he is a sweet kid who needs a stable, loving home and we can provide that.",85
za9cjk,Fosterparents,2,"My concern is that the kid has averaged 6 homes a year and we don’t know why. My wife and the schools have seen no signs of anything serious, no violence or trauma, he is well adjusted, happy and gets along with everyone. Is this normal? Is 30 plus homes unusual? Is the system that broken? Or should I be really wary? I have no context to help me understand this number of homes.",74
za9cjk,Fosterparents,3,I would expect him to show some challenges related to attachment and trust if he's been in that many times. It will take a long time for him to let his guard down.,33
za9cjk,Fosterparents,4,"A home environment can be very challenging for some students; school is structured and predictable, and serious trauma very rarely happens in a school.",24
za9cjk,Fosterparents,5,"The fact that your wife already has a solid relationship with him should be a really big help. Many stories from foster care where children do well start this way. Of course, he has significant trauma and is likely not as ""well-adjusted"" under the surface as he seems. You may want to read about trauma; ""What Happened to You"" by Dr. Bruce Perry and Oprah is a fairly easy read and a great introduction.",74
za9cjk,Fosterparents,6,That doesn't mean that you won't have a rewarding experience.,10
za9cjk,Fosterparents,7,The system is that broken. I have literal infants that average six homes. INFANTS. I have teens who have had hundreds of placements. And kids who have no placement go into what is called temporary placements where they literally are moved every week if not every day - the commitments are only for a day at a time. Sounds like he has been in that a few times.,68
za9cjk,Fosterparents,8,"All children in foster care have trauma behaviors, and every move worsens them. We recruit too many untrained foster families. A child being harmed is never the fault of the child. Foster care often harms the children more than the original bio family due to the nature of trauma and its affect on the brain.",55
za9cjk,Fosterparents,9,"I will be honest, the amount of homes is going to have caused a lot of pain and damage, but **it isn't his fault.** I'm sure many were also abusive emotionally (even if unintentional - many people use traditional parenting methods of punishment not understanding it is harmful and abusive to traumatized kids), just due to the statistical odds, and caused his pain to deepen. I could take a perfect super child, from the best family in the world, and if you put that child through what that foster child has been through, they would act the same way. Heck, if I took an adult, they would act the same way (if not worse).",114
za9cjk,Fosterparents,10,"It is going to be a hard journey (but if you have the right mindset, amazing, because you're helping an abused child and growing as a person yourself to be more patient, loving, empathetic, and strong) and you're going to have to dedicate yourself to learning and studying trauma and parenting traumatized kids. As long as you take the time to really learn and research, it is going to be one of the best things you have chosen to do in your life (although sometimes you may regret it and want to jump out the window - but that is just being a parent in general). The child you see in school is the child he is deep down, but there are going to be huge scary trauma behaviors that arise once he is placed in your home to test you and see if you will disrupt. These kids will do everything they can to try to push you away. If you prepare for it and dedicate yourself to **committing**, then you'll live and come out stronger for it, and it will save his literal physical and neurological development in ways that are profound.",194
za9cjk,Fosterparents,11,"I recommend reading some books. In fact, a lot of books. The more you read, the better off you'll be. There are also some great on demand DVDs by Karyn Purvis regarding TBRI. I find these to be incredible.",39
za9cjk,Fosterparents,12,"Be wary of Reddit and social media groups. Always remember that the type people who failed him initially are also members, and even though well-intended, do not have the skillset to heal but often end up profoundly breaking these kids.",40
za9cjk,Fosterparents,13,"Get therapy for yourself and for him right away. If you need a good virtual group with trainings, PM me.",20
za9cjk,Fosterparents,14,"And although I'm not too religious, God bless you for doing this for him. You do not understand the impact you can have. It is so profound.",27
za9cjk,Fosterparents,15,Thank you for stepping up for this child. 30 homes? That's atrocious and not normal. Definitely have a frank talk about this with the social worker. It may not be the child's fault at all but it's definitely something to carefully discuss.,42
za9cjk,Fosterparents,16,"Thank you. I ordered the book. I know it will take time and gentle persistence to gain his trust, and I’m quiet and patient. It will come in time, I’m sure. It just has to be earned honestly.",38
za9cjk,Fosterparents,17,"Thank you. I completely understand that the kid is blameless, and that a load of bad decisions by adults in his life have brought him here. I know we have a job ahead of us, but like anything worth doing, it’s worth doing it right. This isn’t about us, it’s about him.",52
za9cjk,Fosterparents,18,"I love Dr. Bruce Perry. His other book is very good too, ""The Boy Who Was Raised As A Dog.""",20
za9cjk,Fosterparents,19,"I would read Dr. Perry's books before reading, ""The Body Keeps The Score"" which is also commonly recommended and is going to come up to you at some point. They're very similar books and the two authors worked in the same labs, but one is aimed at adults and the other is aimed at kids. Read ""The Body Keeps The Score"" after.",62

za9rlq,relationship_advice,0,How do I present PS5 to my Bf for Hanukkah…,10
za9rlq,relationship_advice,1,"The past few months my (23F) boyfriend (25 M) of over 2 years has been my rock. I recently lost my grandfather to cancer and my parents went to go take care of our family in Israel. In doing that they left me to take care of my two younger sisters, the house, and our 4 pets (3 dogs and 1 cat) for a month and a half. On top of that I’m a full time student that babysits and dog-sits on the side. My boyfriend has been trying to take off as much of the responsibility as possible so that I can still do my school work and pass my classes. He has been taking my sisters to school, doctors appointments, helping with the pets, cleaning the house and cleaning the dishes after I cook. I don’t know how I could have coped without him.",146

zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,0,Sad about my master's graduation,5
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,1,I (30f) am graduating next week from my Master's program for my dream career. I've been working hard since 2019 in this program and I've done well even when switching to remote learning due to the pandemic.,37
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,2,My fiance (30m) currently lives 6 hours away for his doctoral program that he's dreamed of ever since I met him 11 years ago. He unfortunately will not be able to attend because he has final exams the next day. I completely understand and I don't want him to do poorly on his final exams especially since he expressed concern that he hasn't been performing to his standards and may risk some need for remediation. I truly do not want him to risk his performance for his exam to travel to me for graduation and so forth. We both discussed that it is in both of our interests that he stay at school to prepare for his exams.,118
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,3,"As the days come closer and closer to graduation, I become more sad that he won't be there to share this monumental ceremony experience with me. I am saddened because he's been with me for the last 11 years, proposed to me this year, and he's been there supporting me throughout my entire undergraduate and graduate career. I want to share this special moment with him and celebrate with him. I've done the same for him as he also started his doctoral program this year and supported him throughout. I'm extremely proud of him and want him to excel and exceed in his program.",104
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,4,"He has expressed feeling guilty of not being able to make it. I've told him time and time again that though he may feel guilty, it's okay. Because even though I lie about being sad momentarily when I think about him not being there, I truthfully tell him that I am extremely happy he's in his dream program and that he will have the career he's been working so hard for for the past 11 years. I truly don't want him to feel guilty because I sort of do think him not coming is an investment for his program to pass, not remediate, and get that degree. I was reminded throughout my master's program that committing to it and making sure I graduate costs us a short term sacrifice of not always being able to be there for your loved ones or for personal enjoyment, for long term payout (hopefully).",150
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,5,"I do plan on spending much much more time with him after I graduate and travel with my family internationally for the holidays (he is not joining due to the 14 hour flights to and from, 16 hour time difference, and about only a 1.5-2 week break). So the distance is not an issue, it's just that I'm sad he won't be at graduation. Plus, I will be his study buddy again once I'm back since I have to study for board exams.",83
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,6,"I think the sadness just revolves around wanting to have my person be there with me to see me graduate. To take pictures for memories that we both did this together, celebrate together with family afterwards at my favorite restaurant, and just have a final deep breath of relief with my fiance and family that I actually completed my program. I want to have every monumental accomplishments and experiences shared with him.",72
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,7,I wanted to get this off my chest because I sometimes feel like a burden when I have the need to cry or express my sadness when it comes around. Just needed to vent and express. Thank you for reading.,40
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,8,"trivial in the grand scheme. ten years from now you'll look back at this and wonder what you were thinking, stressing out about this. just enjoy and set up your plans for spending time together when you can.",38

zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,11,"Once, my diploma was laying around and I used it as a dustbin while I was sweeping the floor.",19
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,12,Congratulations! Could he watch the ceremony via FaceTime or something? You both sound like awesome people who have accomplished so much and unfortunately as you well know it involves some compromises. Better than nothing.,34
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,13,My parents skipped out on mine because they didn’t feel like driving. At least he has a good reason. The hurt is real though. This internet stranger is proud of you! Congratulations,32
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,14,Thank you! We're both proud of our accomplishments we've both gotten to and I will thank you on his behalf for him getting to his. We both know the compromises suck but GAH! We will definitely be fine,38
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,15,What's great is that the event is going to be live streamed. He will definitely be watching if he's not in the middle of an exam.,26
zaaonr,TrueOffMyChest,16,I'm so sorry to hear that about your graduation. My friend is having the same situation with her parents not initially wanting to attend due to driving and eventually convinced them to go. Thank you for understanding the sadness around this. Thank you so much!,45
zaaxdh,Catholicism,0,Job trying to force me to work Feast of the Immaculate Conception even though I said I couldn’t,18
zaaxdh,Catholicism,1,As you all probably know December 8th is the feast of the immaculate conception. I cashier after school twice a week and weekends and the one day I said I couldn’t work in December was the 8th but they scheduled me anyways. (My work has ignored a lot of my availability but that’s besides the point.) Do I have any legal rights in this situation? Or do you have any suggestions for how I should explain to them why I can’t work that day.,84
zaaxdh,Catholicism,2,Masses are either during the school day or during my shift at all the parishes around me.,17
zaaxdh,Catholicism,3,"I'd ask your boss one more time as they could have forgot. If they say no, I'd inform them you'll be calling out that day for your religious obligation. And then do just that.",34
zaaxdh,Catholicism,4,"Could be just an oversight. Tell your boss again that you need off so you can attend church. Can you work before and after, like just take a longer lunch break or whatever? Can you get someone else to cover for you?",42
zaaxdh,Catholicism,5,> Do I have any legal rights in this situation?,10
zaaxdh,Catholicism,6,"If you are in the United States, your employer may be breaking Federal and State law by denying you a reasonable religious accommodation",23
zaaxdh,Catholicism,7,"My suggestion is to clearly state, in writing to your superior, that your religion requires you to attend a worship service on December 8th and your scheduled shift conflicts with the worship service you will be attending. Most likely they will do nothing, but if they do you have etablished evidence for a religious discrimination claim.",56
zaaxdh,Catholicism,8,Any chance of making it to a Vigil Mass on the evening of the 7th? Not optimal but meets the obligation without making too many waves at work.,28
zaaxdh,Catholicism,9,"My daughter is 17 and works 15-20 hours a week. It's at a retreat center, so weekends are busy. She's asked that if they have her work Sunday morning, they give her Saturday afternoon off so she can get to Mass. It's a Christian employer so that helps, but they still don't get the concept of ""obligation.""",57
zaaxdh,Catholicism,10,"I would just not show up. If they penalize you somehow, threaten legal action for religious discrimination.",17
zaaxdh,Catholicism,11,"Tell them you aren't asking. If they have scheduling problems they don't have enough employees and probably won't fire you. If they do, you're better off finding a different job anyway. You're way too young to put up with that kind of disrespect to your time.",46
zaaxdh,Catholicism,12,"Just be calm. ""I saw Im on the schedule next week, I need to attend mass at (offer available mass times)"" I'm happy to be flexible, I just need to be there for an hour + travel, anything you can do to help me?""",44
zaaxdh,Catholicism,13,People will work with you.,5
zaaxdh,Catholicism,14,"As I tell my crewing, as a union rep, that is a crewing issue not a me issue. You told them and they didn’t listen.",25
zaaxdh,Catholicism,15,"**Mr. Nice Guy Approach**: Trade shifts with someone who is off for December 8, tell your boss that you took care of it yourself and remind him (verbally and in writing) that you needed that day off for religious reasons.",40
zaaxdh,Catholicism,16,"**Firm Approach**: Reiterate to your boss (verbally and in writing) that you need that day off for religious reasons and you refuse to work that day, period. Make him fix it himself.",32
zaaxdh,Catholicism,17,**Scorched Earth**: Call a lawyer.,5
zaaxdh,Catholicism,18,"You can always just not show up. Tell them you cannot be at work that day, you already notified them, and let them know you won’t be coming. If they fire you (they won’t) there are MANY other cashier jobs around. This is not an important job, don’t even give them an inch.",53
zaaxdh,Catholicism,19,"If I were in the situation, I would first reiterate to the boss that I would be unavailable that day, and if the boss refused to change it, I would just give the boss an ultimatum: either take me off the schedule or I quit.",45
zaaxdh,Catholicism,20,"I had to deal with this when Gamestop was putting up blasphemous images of the Sacred Heart. Tell them you are protected under the law by Title 7 of EEOA. Once they understood this, they started whistling a different tune and went out of their way to keep me away from stuff involving the offensive. These laws are for your protection in the US.",64
zaaxdh,Catholicism,21,Your school can likely function without you for an hour or two easier than your employer can. Can you miss a class or two and go during the school day?,30
zaaxdh,Catholicism,22,"Not sure where your parents fit in, but would they be open to excusing you from classes to attend Mass?",20
zaaxdh,Catholicism,23,Well I work in the evenings so they don’t give me any breaks those days. I’m the only cashier working usually too. Most of the people I work with refuse to work at night and the other people who do are usually too busy to take on another shift. I’ll definitely ask though,53
zaaxdh,Catholicism,24,I don’t think there’s any past 8pm at the parishes around me but I could double check.,17
zaaxdh,Catholicism,25,"No, you should definitely inform your employer that it is a religious holiday",13
zaaxdh,Catholicism,26,Usually people don’t switch with me but I’ll definitely try. Worst comes to worse can I actually hire a lawyer?,20
zaaxdh,Catholicism,27,"Don’t quit. If they want to fire you over a religious obligation, let them.",14
zaaxdh,Catholicism,28,That’s a terrible idea…and also illegal,6
zaaxdh,Catholicism,29,I mean i could but my mom isn’t Catholic and she wouldn’t be willing to call me out of school.,20
zaaxdh,Catholicism,30,So you can't get to a Mass during the day? I realize that you said you're a student.,18
zaaxdh,Catholicism,31,I assumed they had already done that.,7
zaaxdh,Catholicism,32,> can I actually hire a lawyer?,7
zaaxdh,Catholicism,33,You can...but you can likely kiss the job goodbye and it'll cost you a lot of money.,17
zaaxdh,Catholicism,34,"Leaving school for a couple hours is illegal? I don't know this person to be a minor, and even if they are, I don't know of anywhere that a parent can't pull a student out of school for a short period of time. Hell, we routinely pull kids out for a week at a time to go deer hunting.",59
zaaxdh,Catholicism,35,I can’t unless I skipped school,6
zaaxdh,Catholicism,36,It’s illegal for a business to have a high school kid come to work during his class time.,18
zaaxdh,Catholicism,37,OP is clearly some high schooler.,6
zaaxdh,Catholicism,38,"Well it depends on what would be the worse consequences.... missing a class or two, or possibly losing your job. 🤷🏼‍♂️",21
zaaxdh,Catholicism,39,I didn’t suggest having anyone leave school to go to work.,11
zaaxdh,Catholicism,40,"That said, when I was a senior in highschool I went to school for half of a day and worked half a day so it isn’t illegal here. I had all the credits I needed by then though.",38
zaaxdh,Catholicism,41,"If you aren’t in school at the time then it’s legal, but an employer cannot be having student workers sipping to work. OP seems imply they are in class.",29
zaaxdh,Catholicism,42,Nobody suggested that the employer would be having the student miss class to work. I suggested they miss class to attend Mass.,22
zabslv,saskatchewan,0,Stuck in the middle of an increasingly nasty parental separation,10
zabslv,saskatchewan,1,I know there are websites for public legal assistance (plea.org and familyplea.org) but sometimes it’s just easier to talk and ask stupid questions with a live person…,27
zabslv,saskatchewan,2,Are there any lawyers or legal professionals that could give advice related to property division that I could use to get my parents to act equitably with each other as their separation is beginning to get nasty?,37
zabslv,saskatchewan,3,"If they don't qualify for legal aid, try a mediator.",10
zabslv,saskatchewan,4,Call Pro Bono Law Saskatchewan. They run a bunch of free legal clinics throughout the province. You can get an appointment with a lawyer to ask questions.,27
zabslv,saskatchewan,5,A mediator will be more cost effective and the goal is a solution with a mediator as with an attorney (only my experience) the goal was a trial.,28
zabslv,saskatchewan,6,"Lawyers only make things nastier. I went through a divorce and have a friend going through one right now, he kept asking about lawyers and I told him NO, they will cost you a fortune and try to run up the bill.",42
zabslv,saskatchewan,7,"Call Family Matters which is a government service, and they can get your parents in for a free session with a mediator which is what we did, didn't cost us a dime. This is assuming both parties actually want to deal. However even if they don't, they will provide advice for free.",52
zacpdj,Christianity,0,Can someone explain this for me please?,7
zacpdj,Christianity,1,"I was at church, listening to the youth pastor talk. I zoned out for a second and had a vision. I was looking through the eyes of Jesus while he was on the cross. I could see and look around. I saw his feet and hands nailed to the cross and all the people staring at him. I saw the landscape around him. It was grey and cloudy, there were a lot of rocks, and they were on a cliff. I could literally see everything perfectly. I was wondering if anyone knew what it meant. This has never happened to me before so I don’t know what to think of this.",111
zacpdj,Christianity,2,Next time when you zone out don’t stare directly at the lights,12

zacpdj,Christianity,6,You’ve never had your mind just wander off into a daydream before?,12
zacpdj,Christianity,7,"Given you were in church, probably with a crucified Jesus front and centre, the context of your daydream is not surprising.",21
zacpdj,Christianity,8,"I have. When I do it’s quick, faint and I don’t really remember what I daydreamed about after a while. What I saw was so vivid and realistic. I can tell you exactly what I saw detail for detail right now, the day after. It could’ve been a daydream but if it was, I have never had anything like that before.",61
zacpdj,Christianity,9,"Do you remember every dream, everything that ever happened to you?",11
zacpdj,Christianity,10,"Memory is like that. Some things stick. This particular dream seemed unusual to you and you’ve assigned significance to it, so it’s getting priority memory space.",26
zacpdj,Christianity,11,"New experiences tend to do that, it keeps your brain alert for anything similar and any threats or hazards that might come with it.",24
zacpdj,Christianity,12,"Regular boring old dreams and day to day stuff gets stuffed down the back of the memory sofa, as you’ve already processed that and are familiar with it.",28
zad3s2,aircanada,0,Possibly dumb layover question,4
zad3s2,aircanada,1,"Hi there, not sure if anyone can help me with this but I’m a little worried about my layover time for an upcoming AC flight. In mid January I’m flying from Halifax to New York through Montreal. The first flight gets into YUL at around 7:40am. It’s then an hour and a half layover before the flight to New York. Am I going to be screwed for getting through customs? I know technically the airline wouldn’t offer the trip if it wasn’t enough time but I haven’t flown internationally since long before COVID so I’m panicking a little. I’m not checking any bags which I think helps my case. I’m also travelling alone if that makes a difference. If anyone has any insight on whether I should look into changing my flight please let me know!",136
zad3s2,aircanada,2,"There are flights from Montréal to NYC almost every hour in the morning. If you do miss the connection, AC will just put you in the next flight. The caveat is which NYC airport you will be put on to.",40
zad3s2,aircanada,3,"It will be tight that time of the morning, but they pulled ppl from the connections line through customs last time I was there in a long line so you should be fine. Not having a checked bag will save you hours and hours if you were to misconnect.",49
zad3s2,aircanada,4,"Should be fine. Last time I did transborder in YUL was in October and the luggage was the slow bit at US customs so if you can avoid checking a bag that will help. But as long as your departure is on time it should be fine. As someone else mentioned, there are lots of other daily flights so worst case is you get rebooked a few hours later.",69
zad898,breastcancer,0,Feeling Devastated,2
zad898,breastcancer,1,I was diagnosed with DCIS and tested positive for BRCA2. I have had to make the difficult decision of getting a double mastectomy and reconstruction. I will also get my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.,35
zad898,breastcancer,2,I am devastated that the body that I know will drastically change. I don’t want implants but I also don’t want to lose my breasts so I opted for implants. Using my own tissue is possible but it means going to a new hospital and starting the process all over again with a new care team (which I also don’t want).,61
zad898,breastcancer,3,It’s hard to accept and even harder when it’s getting closer to setting a surgery date. It’s super alienating and I don’t even feel like a person anymore.,28
zad898,breastcancer,4,"I hope it gets better but it’s hard to see anything but losses. I am a young person and just.. I feel so robbed of so many things. I feel so sad. I am also single too so there is also the worry that no one would accept me with no nipple, and scarred. Just venting…",56
zad898,breastcancer,5,"Ask if you are a candidate for nipple sparing mastectomy. I had that. I am only at the spacer stage, but am impressed how good they look and how delicate the scarring is.",33
zad898,breastcancer,6,I also had an oophrectomy at the same time as the BMx.,12
zad898,breastcancer,7,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I honestly hate breast cancer (or any kind of cancer) so much. It’s unfair and no one ever deserves this, especially women who have to sacrifice their boobs.",35
zad898,breastcancer,8,I’m amazed by those who are able to make the hard decisions (though what choice do we have?). I can’t imagine how painful and uncomfortable reconstruction will be.,28
zad898,breastcancer,9,"Though there is nothing I can do for you, I’ll be thinking of you, my fellow sister. If this helps at all, know that there are so many women in the same boat as you, and you’re not alone. Rant and vent here all you want and we will hear your voice. The world is cruel enough as it is, but this is your safe place.",66
zad898,breastcancer,10,Wishing you a speedy recovery!,5
zad898,breastcancer,11,"I’m so sorry you have to deal with this. Ask your team if you’re a candidate for a nipple sparing mastectomy. My nipples lost all sensation which is hard to adjust to, but aesthetically they look fine.",37
zad898,breastcancer,12,"One thing to consider is that implants don’t have to be permanent. I wasn’t a candidate for a tissue flap surgery, but my plastic surgeon said I can get implants right now and then get them removed and do a flap procedure in the future. It will end up being extra surgeries down the line, but it might be worth it if you want to get it over with as quickly as possible.",73
zad898,breastcancer,13,"Also, I can only have sex with a bra on now. It’s been a year and a half and it’s still super emotional for me to take my bra off around someone. Not one guy has ever complained about me wearing a bra during sex. They’re just excited to be having sex!",52
zad898,breastcancer,14,Keeping you in my thoughts <3,6
zad898,breastcancer,15,Same here! I'm only 36 and looking at double mastectomy with removal of ovaries and fallopian tunes in the future. I have an appt next Tuesday and will hopefully be setting up my surgery after that appt. I am here and going to be going through a similar experience if you wanted to chat at all! Best wishes to you.,60
zad898,breastcancer,16,Hugs to you,3
zad898,breastcancer,17,"Asking with the nipple-sparing surgeries, you also have the option of tattooing nipples on your breasts if you choose, along with nipple reconstruction surgery. I was offered the nipple reconstruction as part of the DIEP recommendation but eagerly opted to pass. I spent my entire life trying to hide my very temperature responsive nipples and was happy to never have to think about that again. I haven't yet decided what to do about nipples, I'm going the tattoo route but haven't decided if I'm going to get a regular nipple or go for something more creative. There are a lot of beautiful images if you search for mastectomy tattoos.",109
zad898,breastcancer,18,"I'm sorry that you're facing such a hard situation. It sucks. As others have said, you are not your boobs, you are a person with boobs that needs to get rid of them before they kill you. It feels like a betrayal, but it gets easier over time.

I prayed about what to do and decided it was my body and I was going to work thru this. I do not understand why they remove other female organs.

I changed my diet, took one small chemo pill (doctor insisted that if she was going to treat me and help me to monitor my progress). It has been five years. I had four years of progress and the fifth year my immune system was weakened and the cancer went up on me. But I focused on being grateful, eating and exercising and low stress, as much as possible.

I am thankful for each day. I am thankful for the healing. I accept each day as valuable and look forward to what each day offers and will not live with the regret of turning myself over to someone else to make my decisions.

zad898,breastcancer,26,Hi. I had the same thing and opted for DCIS instead of implants. Just a thought,16
zad898,breastcancer,27,I also had a nipple and skin sparing mastectomy. I'm shocked how normal my reconstructed breasts look. The only incision is along the breast crease.,25
zad898,breastcancer,28,I will ask. I know my oncologist is not a fan of keeping it because the cancer is there. Thank you for the tip.,24
zad898,breastcancer,29,Thank you so much. I appreciate the support and kind words. We don’t have many choices except to save our lives.,21
zad898,breastcancer,30,I want to eventually replace the implants with my own tissue. My first objective is to get rid of the cancer first. Thank you for your lovely words.,28
zad898,breastcancer,31,I’m sorry you had to go through this too.,9
zad898,breastcancer,32,Are you me? I’m turning 36 this year. It’s so hard to accept all these massive changes. I hope you’re doing okay. BRCA2 is evil. I wish you all the best with your surgeries and healing.,36
zad898,breastcancer,33,Thanks! I am doing pretty well I think! I get so anxious as my appts get closer. It's hard not knowing what to expect! I am happy to read through other people's experiences! Makes me feel less alone! Brca is evil for sure! Decimated my dad's side of the family so I feel fortunate that I became aware at a younger age. I keep trying to look at the positives.,70
zad898,breastcancer,34,Thank you ❤️,3
zad898,breastcancer,35,💕💕💕,1
zad898,breastcancer,36,"Thank you, friend! ❤️",4
zad898,breastcancer,37,>opted for DCIS instead of implants,6
zad898,breastcancer,38,What did you mean to type instead of DCIS? DIEP maybe?,11
zad898,breastcancer,39,"Same! I had resigned myself to awful scars, but maybe they would look cool? Like war wounds? A car accident but I survived? Or maybe they wouldn’t be awful, but surely my breasts would never look good.",37
zad898,breastcancer,40,When the scabs fell off from nipples (it took *ages* on one breast) I was stunned how good they looked.,20
zad898,breastcancer,41,"I guess they will redo the incision edges when I have the spacers removed and the implants placed, and *then* they’ll be careful about the scars. Silicone coverings and such. I blurted out: “these the “bad” scars?!?”",37
zad898,breastcancer,42,"The scars are very thin, and only slightly red (which will fade). Where it is red, it perfectly matches the areola. They’re perky and even. I love them, and they aren’t even in their final form.",36
zad898,breastcancer,43,"I hope this helps. I was vain about my nipples (it’s not good to be vain, but I was) and so I was scared how things would look. I hope my (anecdotal) data helps someone.",35
zad898,breastcancer,44,"It’s easy for me to say because I was lucky enough to keep both nipples, but looking at pictures of my PS’s work, I was shocked how good the “constructed” nipples looked. Then I assumed, oh, they look good now but will deteriorate or shrink or something in 5 years. But her PA (who I trust perhaps most of all my cancer medical people) said that rarely happens. Anyway, this made me less scared at the potential mine would die or need to be removed. I mean, they looked *good*.",90
zad898,breastcancer,45,"I haven’t seen pictures of 3D tattoos, but from other people commenting, these can look great too.",17
zad898,breastcancer,46,"Wishing a successful outcome for you, both cancer-wise and looks-wise.",10
zad898,breastcancer,47,Lol... yep DIEP... darn autocorrect.,5
zad898,breastcancer,48,I felt the same way! I refused to look at them after the mastectomy and tissue expander placement until my mom told me she was impressed at an appointment with the surgeon.,32
zad898,breastcancer,49,I did follow up with a PAP flap reconstruction a few weeks ago which came with a startling number of incisions. Everything is healing really well and I'm thrilled with the results. I will have some scars but nothing as disfiguring as I envisioned in my mind. My surgeon cut through a tattoo on the front of my hip and you can't even tell at 3 weeks out. It's incredible. I am already much more comfortable in my skin that I anticipated at this stage. Now if only my hair could grow back faster!,94
zadpq7,detrans,0,Our inability to discuss transitioning rationally as a society is worrisome.,11
zadpq7,detrans,1,It’s very taboo to even suggest that a 12 year old child might not be in the right mind when they come out as trans.,25
zadpq7,detrans,2,I work with mentally ill adolescents and half of them have some degree of gender dysphoria and identify as trans.,20
zadpq7,detrans,3,"It's way too politicized. This sort of thing should be science based, not ideological...",14
zadpq7,detrans,4,"Very true, trans has become rebellion, defiance, assertion for adolescents.",10
zadpq7,detrans,5,"That age is so vulnerable as they are looking for adults to admire and establish a way to be unique. Prime age for gang recruitment, sexual exploration, talking into drug experimentation. And now transgenderism has been presented to kids almost like ""here try this joint, show you're cool""",48
zadpq7,detrans,6,Yeah. It's the unfortunate result of the pendulum swinging the other way combining with social media and backlash to anti-trans persecution.,21
zadpq7,detrans,7,"I expect it will not be long until the ""groomer"" narrative and the bad PR makes it swings back and trans people are forced back to the periphery of society.",30
zadpq7,detrans,8,"I’ve been in the political space for as long as I can remember, almost.",14
zadpq7,detrans,9,Right now we can’t discuss anything rationally.,7
zadpq7,detrans,10,Yup. Makes me think about who it’s benefitting,8
zadpq7,detrans,11,"There's been many studies proving that human's frontal lobes, especially where we logically weigh risks and think of the future, don't fully develop until our early twenties. On top of that, there's a lot of fantasy and support for anyone that likes to deviate from the norm, no matter how odd or strange. Got a really strange, possibly isolating or even unhealthy kink shared by maybe 10k out of 8 billion people? The internet will make it seem like you're not alone, enabling you with all illusions you could hope for.",91
zadpq7,detrans,12,"Very recently I went to a public concert where another attendee showed up in a head to toe anthropomorphic furry outfit. My spouse's immediate reaction was to exhale and say, ""Well I don't think anyone will be looking too closely at *me* tonight."" We came to learn later that night that he now lives full time as his ""fursona"", using only his fursona name. He's married, works from home full time in IT, and his spouse was with him. I would like to say his spouse supports him, but she honestly looked pretty uncomfortable and resigned anytime I dared to look. No way to know how old he was, but it had to be late 20's early 30's if it matched the age of his wife.",126
zadpq7,detrans,13,"Certainly gave me a lot to think about since then... I imagine that was an interesting conversation to have with his immediate family. Sort of puts a lot of perspective on ""coming out, being brave, living your truth."" My spouse, for all their journey's, didn't seem very supportive. I still don't know how I feel, other than... sympathy. I'm afraid to look into it more too, lest the algorithms take my curiosity for earnest interest.",75
zadpq7,detrans,14,"I will say, from what I have observed, is that *a lot* of young people simply consider transitioning ""an option"" versus an affirmation; and often with the argument that, ""people should just be allowed to do what they want, it's not hurting anyone right?""",44
zadpq7,detrans,15,"I know, this shit makes me so anxious for everyone. Younger and older. This shit is serious and life changing but no, let's get riskyyyyy🎉 😮‍💨",26
zadpq7,detrans,16,Like most things today unfortunately. Look at covid imo it should have never been a political thing and only a 100% scientific thing. I hate the current state of politics,30
zadpq7,detrans,17,"That worries me too. My spouse is intersex and after going back and forth, being on both E and T trying to figure themselves out, they now consider themselves nonbinary.",30
zadpq7,detrans,18,"I recently read that as many as 2% of people are intersex, about the same rate as people with red hair. So if you've met someone with red hair, you've probably met someone who is intersex. In addition to my spouse I currently know a woman who is quite tall, grows a full beard (has an obvious five o'clock shadow otherwise), and visually doesn't pass for female very well. But, she IS female, genuinely FAB, and has had children. I don't remember the specifics are for her medical diagnosis, but her existence has been a valuable lesson to concepts held by others.",102
zadpq7,detrans,19,"Many people I know believe as I do, that it's entirely natural to be homosexual (or bisexual within a spectrum of homo and hetero). But many people think there is only male or female, and scientifically I know that there's a hell of a lot more variables regarding sex.",49
zadpq7,detrans,20,"After a lot of study (and I'm talking 20+ years here) I'm of the opinion that a lot of true transexuals do exist and are inherently intersex, and that depending on the medical diagnosis there's a spectrum there too, but the peer science is lacking. And that spectrum can change-- there was a case of an intersex man with Klinefelter's whom after an illness their adrenals reset and their body went with the XX instead of the XY of their natural XXY state.",83
zadpq7,detrans,21,"Thus, he grew breasts and his body began naturally feminizing. Having always felt female privately, once their body changed, that person chose to transition. Whether or not they got bottom surgery I don't know, but they were effectively a woman with working male sex organs otherwise. Again, it bothers me greatly when people argue that intersex people still must be one or the other, like there can't somehow be a spectrum there too.",73
zadpq7,detrans,22,"I think it would be very helpful if genetic and medical testing were stardard as part of transitioning, including endocrine testing and mapped neurology via MRI, but that would call into question that there's more to it than belief or that people should simply be free to do as they wish. This is further exacerbated in places like the USA where transitioning has become somewhat common but otherwise medicine in general is pretty abysmal.",74
zadpq7,detrans,23,"The people acting out their hentai feminization fantasies, and the doctors making money off it.",15
zadpq7,detrans,24,To the question-- so are they in their fursuit now 24-7?,11
zadpq7,detrans,25,"I assume the answer is mostly? Logically I'm pretty sure they don't shower in it. We went to the concert with several friends. One of my friends had a panic attack so security took them out of the venue for a bit, another friend went with them as a support person and they were taken to a quieter area to get some air. The person in their fursuit and his wife was also there, because being around so many people in the fursuit they kept overheating.",86
zadpq7,detrans,26,"My friend who was the support person is utterly fearless and didn't waste the opportunity to chat them up, which is how we found out they're living full-time as their fursona now. They can eat in it, but my friend didn't inquire about other... functions.",45
zadpq7,detrans,27,"On the drive home that night my spouse remarked that if they're in it full time and they're overheating then it must get pretty sweaty and smelly and they must have to get it dry cleaned. They must have multiple sets of the suit too. It was a clearly custom-made high quality fursuit, I can't imagine it's having been inexpensive. Getting multiple made at the same time probably would have been somewhat cost-effective?",73
zae0ap,relationship_advice,0,What is disorganized attachment style?,5
zae0ap,relationship_advice,1,"I used to think i was on the avoidant side of attachment styles until i found myself in two different relationships ( at different times in my life btw, but each a year apart) where i leaned into anxious attachment. Growing and learning about my patterns, taking tests etc has lead me to believe I actually have disorganized attachment which is like a whole mixed up can of worms. My family can be very loving and supportive, but something i realized young is that no one in my family let’s others speak, there is very little listening that goes on and alot of talking at instead of to. This is something that deeply affected me as a child, and still now, the subject of many of my nightmares (ig i have a big fear of not being heard and or being misinterpreted) when i was in college i found myself in a physically but mostly emotionally abusive relationship that took me many years to make sense of and begin to heal from. I mention this bc it has come to my attention that experience most likely greatly affected my attachment style as well.",193
zae0ap,relationship_advice,2,"I guess now i’m just scared bc even though I go to therapy, and have improved with some of my communication skills, i’m just still confused what it means for me to have this attachment style. How can I continue to work on this issue? A lot of stuff i read online makes me worried like my attachment style makes me the most unstable/hardest to deal with of the styles. My partner assumed i was anxiously attached and up until this point I had thought this too. How does this change things now that i feel I am disorganized attached instead?",101

zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,6,Here are some events that I’ve made note of in my life (please note that I do not remember my childhood very well. The ages + events are as accurate as I can possibly get them):,36
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,7,***** Ages 4-8: *****,4
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,8,"- • - When I would throw a tantrum, my parents (mainly my mom) would tell me to go into the bathroom, shut the door, and not come out. I would scream, cry, and scratch at the walls/door. The door would never be locked, but I was told that I wasn’t allowed out so I always stayed in the bathroom until they thought I was calm enough to come out.",70
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,9,"- • - One night, after my parents had been yelling at each other (mainly my dad antagonizing my mother), my mom cuddled up to me in her bed (I slept in their bed a lot). We started to hear loud “crunching” noises, so we both got up to see what was going on. My dad was standing over a broken chair in our dining room. He had ripped the entire wooden chair into pieces with his bare hands. I remember being terrified.",83
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,10,"- • - I remember witnessing my dad physically intimidating my mother by backing her into her car door. He was chest to chest with her, and he was yelling. They both knew that I was standing there, afaik. Neither of them remember this event, so I’m not sure if it actually happened. I have brought it up to them a couple of times.",64
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,11,"- • - Around this age, my parents would fight a LOT and threaten divorces in front of me. It got to a point where I, as a small child, actually WISHED that they would get one. This lasted until about age 16 and I believe it has affected my current relationship.",52
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,12,***** Ages 9-13 *****,4
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,13,"- • - My mom decided to open a small business. This is great and I’ll always support her! However, I was ALWAYS at said business. I rarely got to just be at home. I had bad separation anxiety, too, so I never wanted to go hang out with friends. I would be put to work and/or told to go into my mom’s “office”. I was expected to occupy myself, every single day after school, for hours on end. It was frustrating and I remember being upset about it when I was a child. It still upsets me to this day.",101
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,14,"- • - Around this time, I began showing signs of depression and anxiety. I was formally diagnosed and my mom was very supportive of getting me help (getting me into the doctor, encouraging medication, etc.)! I started missing a lot of school during this time due to my mental health. My parents and I fought nearly every single day because I wouldn’t want to go to school. One night, after my parents and I had finished arguing about it, I overheard them talking about me. Being a nosy little shit, I eavesdropped and heard my dad say that my mental illnesses were not real (he has a minor in psych. So, understandably, this made me doubt myself a LOT).",120
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,15,"- • - One night, while out to dinner with my parents, we had gotten into a small argument. I can’t remember what it was about, but I remember that I told them I was “going to run away and kill myself”. My dad hit me in the face for that. (Thx u rlly made it better haha.)",58
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,16,***** Ages 14-20 *****,4
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,17,"- • - By the time I was around 14-15, I was sick of being forced to go to work with my mom at her small business (also, at this point in time, I had transferred to an online school due to mental &amp; physical health reasons). So, I would ask to stay home instead. My mom usually let me stay home every single time that I asked. I would typically be home alone from 10am-8pm during this time. My parents worked a lot, so I barely saw them. One time, I even stayed home alone all day on my birthday (I think I was turning 15 or 16). Yes, I did ask to stay home. However, I really feel like they could’ve made an effort to not neglect (?) me completely.",132
zae4tr,EmotionalAbuseSupport,18,"- • - My dad and I were in the car together one day (I was driving) when we drove past a slew of protesters in our city. He asked what they were protesting, and I told him that they were “pro-lifers” protesting on the opposite street of a non-profit women’s clinic (this clinic offers free pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and doesn’t even perform abortions nor refers patients). My dad, being a pro-lifer, began going on a tangent about being pro-life and why abortion was morally wrong. Me, being pro-choice, naturally began debating him. When things got too heated, I politely asked him to stop because I was getting angry and wanted to drop it. He kept going, and I kept asking him to stop. Finally, I snapped and began yelling at him (which I knew would happen). He told me to “pull the fucking car over” and that he would “walk home”. He got out of the car, I asked him to get back in, and he refused. So, I drove home without him. I was home with my mom (who was trying to calm me down) for about 30-40 minutes. My dad finally walks in, slams the door, and starts yelling at me for not turning around and getting him. (??? What.)",213

zaekha,emotionalneglect,0,What should I do?,4
zaekha,emotionalneglect,1,I don’t know what to do. My therapist told me I was emotionally neglected by my mum for 7 yrs. I’m mad and I want an apology but I think things will go down badly. I want to run away from home because it seems like fun but mainly because I want to show my mum how much she has affected me and to get away from her. I’m going on holiday with her for 5 weeks. Last time we went on holiday she was an A-hole. I don’t know what to do lol,94
zaekha,emotionalneglect,2,"hey friend, sorry you're going through this. feeling angry and grieving is natural and healthy as a reaction to what you've been through. I will say that it's going to be much harder for you to create a space of healing and change while still living with her, but it's possible to start. first, try writing her a letter with all the things you want to say, and then -this is critical- burn the letter. your mother is not emotionally mature or capable enough to be able to give you the closure you need and to meet you on the level you need from her, and I'm sorry about that. It's a hard thing to hear and harder still to accept, but that is part of the process. Confronting your mother won't help you right now, and may make you more unsafe.",142
zaekha,emotionalneglect,3,"There are many types of emotional neglect and many ways it presents, but I found the books Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, How to Do The Work, and It Didn't Start With You to be extremely helpful in starting to heal and understand what happened to me. as for your trip- I don't know your mother's mannerisms and behaviors, so I couldn't tell you what the best approach is, but I would suggest looking up ""Grey Rocking""- Patrick Teahan on youtube has an excellent series about grey rocking, what it looks like, how to practice, etc.",97
zaekha,emotionalneglect,4,"I don't know how nosy your mother is, but mine always read any journal I tried to keep. I ended up making a made-up script only I can read so I could journal safely until I could get out. It might be worth thinking about as a safe way to have catharsis.",52

It's obvious to me this is a server side issue -there are at most about 5 or 6 computers on the office network, sharing its internet access, 4 are M1 Macs, 2 are PCs, with clean Windows installs -nothing suspicious running on these computers that could trigger a particularly sensitive firewall rule on Hetzner's side. The wordpress sites are edited either via WPBakery or Elementor.",107
zahemu,techsupport,6,"Are there any WP plugins that could be causing this 'blacklisting' of their public IP? I was discussing this issue with a friend who recommended that perhaps the firewall on Hetzner's side gets triggered due to too many POST requests when editing said websites, which usually happens with third party website building tools. But this connection issue occurs randomly, even when they haven't touched the websites for the entire day.",70
zahemu,techsupport,7,Does anyone have any ideas?,5
zahemu,techsupport,8,"I think you're on the right path, very likely something coming from the network is triggering a firewall/IDS rule on Hetzner server/network that's triggering this lock out behavior.",28
zahemu,techsupport,9,"It's probably easiest to ask Hetzner about it, but if they are uncooperative then you'll have to watch your outgoing traffic with some sort of tool and hope you can find something. Presumably the connection is encrypted, so this could get difficult.",42
zahemu,techsupport,10,"The plan they have with Hetzner is a very basic hosting plan. Essentially Hetzner said 'you configured the server/firewall/wordpress stuff, we just provide the VM these run on, so you are responsible for making sure it works right, we can't assist in this'.",43
zahemu,techsupport,11,"Okay, yeah, the guy that set it up is the only one that knows what he did.",17
zahemu,techsupport,12,"I guess you could have another expert look at what's configured, but this isn't some easy thing to figure out. I can think of a lot of things that could cause this. From Wordpress plugins to IDSes, Apache modules, etc.",40
zahemu,techsupport,13,One very quick workaround you could try is reconfiguring the firewall with an ACCEPT rule for the Office IP as the first rule. That way any later rules made by some sort of solution can't block the office IP.,39

zakb97,relationship_advice,2,"I’m a 28 y.o. guy and the girl i dated till recently is 23. I met her 4 months ago and since then we’ve been together, and our relationship was so nice, without any arguments, or fights or anything. We understood eachother at a deeper level. We did all things together (e.g cooking, cleaning, etc.). About a week ago or so, she said she needs time for her to solve her personal issue, and she said that she can’t do that while being with me because she doesn’t want to hurt me with her behaviour/ problems. She’s going to go through a dermatological intervention, she’ll have a 5 week exam session and has to write her bachelor’s degree as she’s in the last year of Uni. I gave her the space she needed after we talked, and since then we’ve talked a bit, but obviously the conversation is not as it was before. She said she doesn’t want for me to wait for her, because it would make her feel bad. In the meanwhile i decided to stop smoking drinking(haven’t been drinking a lot before either, but it messes with my training) and hitting the Gym to distract myself from thinking of her. My question is, should i wait for her to solve her stuff and get back together, even if that means waiting for half a year or so or should i just forget about her? I know she asked this for the right reasons, because she’s got a lot on her plate right now. Any answer would be much appreciated",262

zamony,AskConservatives,0,What do you see happening in the future. So Republicans seem to be about cutting entitlements. Yet more and more people live paycheck to paycheck. So what happens when those people go to retire?,34
zamony,AskConservatives,1,"I would consider myself middle class, maybe a bit better. My financial guy tells me that if I want to live in retirement the way I live now I need at least a million dollars in the bank. And that is with SS. IDK, I live in the same house I bought in 1990, we drive Hyundais that are 5 and 10 years old. I paid for my kids to go to college (in state) and our family income is roughly DOUBLE the average family income. I'm not going to have close to a million dollars.",96

My two late 20s sons one with some college the other with a degree have what they consider decent jobs and are making around $50k . Both are a major car problem from going into debt. OK, they should eventually start making more money, but if you start putting money away at 35, you aren't gong to be able to retire on the money you saved.

zamony,AskConservatives,28,By how much? are we cutting entitlements to cut down or stop deficit spending or are we cutting it to make sure people aren't getting something I'm not. If we cut both entitlements and how we pay for them we aren't doing as much.,44
zamony,AskConservatives,29,"So, I'll ask, have you spent money you should have saved? Is it absurd to take that money and repair your car so you can get to work?

zamony,AskConservatives,30,"It's a nice theory that doesn't work in practice. Social security attackers seem to forget that SS hasn't been around forever. And before it was around, their was a lot more elderly poverty. AND the elderly weren't even living nearly as long as they do now.",46

unknown,unknown,11,Put $200 away a month into an index fund and increase that contribution as you income increases over time. If you manage to double that roughly every 10 years you should be in the ballpark of $1M by the time you retire.,42
unknown,unknown,12,Start earlier and it's easier. If you start at even just $50/month at 25 and double that every 10 years so you're contributing only *half* as much per month as above and you'd be only a little behind... match the above and you're well north of $1M by retirement.,49

unknown,unknown,14,They should be. If I were you I'd twist their arm to put away even the smallest monthly contribution just to get them started and they can bump it up later. Help them set up an IRA and the monthly transfer payment. If you really want to help throw a little seed money in there for them as a Christmas gift.

THIS is a very real value which a landlord is providing to his tenants: He invested HIS resources up-front, and is putting HIS resources at risk so YOU don't have to.

zan65s,Welding,0,Can welding still damage your eyes even if you wear eye protection?,12
zan65s,Welding,1,"I'm about to go into college to start learning about how to weld. I chose it cause people say the pay is good and honestly I like doing manual work and think it'll be interesting. But I have a question, even if you wear eye protection can it still damage your eyes due to long exposure even if you're wearing it? Thank you.",63
zan65s,Welding,2,"If you're wearing the right eye protection at the proper time, and wearing it correctly, your eyes will be fine, even with long term exposure",25
zan65s,Welding,3,"Your respiratory system is much less forgiving, wear a good respirator and check your filters often",16
zan65s,Welding,4,"Put your safety first , think of the long haul …. The ones that last in this game are the ones who protect themselves and work smart . Treat your body like shit and it will break down . Yea it’s not the safest trade but there’s also a lot of idiots who skip safety and end up paying for it.",61
zan65s,Welding,5,Use the proper shade number for what you're doing.,9
zan65s,Welding,6,"I saw guys using number 8 shades while stick welding cuz ""they couldn't see the pool"" fucking blinding when I tried their hood.",23
zan65s,Welding,7,"We are also using glass. Auto seems to be ""lighter"" than glass I was 11 with glass and auto I was 12. Stick at 125amps.",25
zan65s,Welding,8,"The damage from welding comes from UV exposure. Every welding hood will block it completely and even clear polycarbonate lenses will block over 99%, so it is a good idea to ALWAYS be wearing clear safeties in a shop environment, even under a welding hood, in case you accidentally get flashed.",51
zan65s,Welding,9,"As someone else said, the much much more significant long term exposure risk is respiratory.",15
zan65s,Welding,10,"I believe that it can. I have been welding for decades, and I always use the darkest shade available, usually a 12. But at the end of a given day, I still feel eyestrain and irritation on occasion. I also have a lot of floaters, which I feel developed over time while welding.",53
zan65s,Welding,11,Also you have to be careful about the arc flash reflecting off stuff behind you and coming in from the back of the helmet. And then there are the inevitable unintentional arc strikes where you end up getting flashed by someone else.,42
zan65s,Welding,12,"If you are super careful and use the proper PPE you will likely be OK, but the potential is still there and you should be aware of that.",28
zan65s,Welding,13,[deleted],1
zan65s,Welding,14,Yes but not the way you think. Think like a lifetime of reading eye strain. Super focused on minute detailed things,21
zan65s,Welding,15,The long-term effects of welding very very close it's tough on the eyes seriously have you seen any old welders you don't have glasses on when you focus your muscles that close to your face all the time and puts a lot of strain on them so you have to be aware of that in terms of the shielding glass keeping your eyes safe yeah you'll be fine,68
zan65s,Welding,16,You have to make sure you are on the right shade,11
zan65s,Welding,17,"You’ll get arc flash… a lot. But that’s just part of the trade. However (correct me if I’m wrong), some if not most safety glasses by them selves have a slight amount of UV protection.",35
zan65s,Welding,18,"As for daily under the hood, there’s different shade levels and it’s all up to preference from there.",18
zan65s,Welding,19,Everything in life will kill you. Happy Friday!!,8
zan65s,Welding,20,Even with protection if you don’t have a full headgear you can get some exposure from other welders in the shop. Depends on how many and if there are screens available. I just weld at home so not an issue for me but an associate is a production welder and he occasionally gets some exposure from others. Also you need to set your hood setting correct or have the correct fixed lens for the process you are using. (There’s plenty on the internet to advise lens shade or equivalent for different processes) happy welding!,94
zan65s,Welding,21,The hardest thing on a welders eyes are the women. You meet Suzie Rotten Crotch in a bar at night. She is a portable beauty queen. However the next morning when you wake up and she is laying next to you your thinking what happened to the queen I left with last night. Some of these gals can be extremely hard on the eyes.,64
zan65s,Welding,22,Going to college? Where do you live? If you can find a local union and try to start an apprenticeship it will be a lot cheaper school. They will give you a job and work conditions are better than non union jobs,42
zan65s,Welding,23,"Not really, but yes. Any exposure to UV light is damaging. Using the proper shade will just delay the inevitable. The real question is if you want to be blind at 60 or 90.",34
zan65s,Welding,24,Depends on the eye protection,5
zan65s,Welding,25,Get UV protection glasses and use at least a 12 shade in your mask.,14
zan65s,Welding,26,"I feel like I have been pretty careful with my eyes during my career, but still developed night blindness a few years in. Not sure I could have done more to protect them.",33
zan65s,Welding,27,"Hello! Just keep in mind, the light you are protecting from, is uv light, so it is invisible, is not the glare you can see when welding.",27
zan65s,Welding,28,"That being said, if your are next to other people welding, let's say in a classroom, even if you are not welding remember that that light still bounces in the walls of the room, so if you think that as long you are not staring at the visible glare your are ok, you'd be wrong, all the people in the room will be the same exposed to a light that behaves like light but you cannot see.",77
zan65s,Welding,29,Enjoy your journey!!!,3
zan65s,Welding,30,Jeez! Reading some replies here is making me glad I'm just a hobby welder.,14
zan65s,Welding,31,"I use shade 12 (with blue eyes) at all times, unless using Flux core, then it's shade 13. My eyes are fine, after 17 years, even though my whole family wears glasses. My breathing was always bad because of asthma, but since I started wearing a respirator at ALL TIMES it's been much better! Always care about your lungs! Eyes have an easy crutch (glasses).....you lungs not so much.",69

zan65s,Welding,35,Noted. Thank ya friend :),5
zan65s,Welding,36,My throat and nose feels kind of soar after working at the factory for 12h. We have air filtered welding masks.. it's all the anti spatter spray fumes saturating the air.. the ventilation system can't keep up. Feels like I need to wear a respirator in there even when I'm not welding.,52
zan65s,Welding,37,After 20 years in the industry my eye are fine. I have only had arc flash 3 times. It's from when someone welds to close behind you. The light will reflect off the inside of your glasses and into your eye.,41
zan65s,Welding,38,"Yeah, every shop has that guy who practically abuses himself on behalf of the boss. ""I don't have a choice, I just gotta get it done"" he says before returning to cutting steel without gloves or glasses on. It takes him a moment to do anything near the floor because his knees are so fucked he can't bend or squat and it's always questionable if he's gonna make it back up...",71
zan65s,Welding,39,That guy keeps me reminded that the boss is less important to me than myself. Fuck anyone who wants me to become disabled to meet some bottom line figure written by some asshat who doesn't even know what his employees do.,41
zan65s,Welding,40,Shade 8 and stick welding shouldn’t be in the same sentence,11
zan65s,Welding,41,Everyone's eyes process light differently. So its possible that he was just less sensitive to light than most people.,19
zan65s,Welding,42,Not to mention in case some grinding wheel explodes or some other thing sends fragments of stuff at your eyes!,20
zan65s,Welding,43,"I feel like the eye strain might be caused from focusing on one point for too long, and possibly using too dark of a shade making it harder to see. Though that depends on what you’re doing of course.",39

zan65s,Welding,62,But what kind of welding are they teaching? If you get in pipefitting/ welding local you can go to school through them for free or next to nothing.

zandy0,GarminWatches,0,Choosing specific app notification in the watch?,7
zandy0,GarminWatches,1,"I just got a garmin venu yesterday and I’m trying to figure out how to configure notifications to suit me. I don’t want all my phones notifications to also show up on my watch, only texts, calendar and phone calls. I don’t understand if it’s possible to fix though. The help section on garmin.com makes it sound like you have to have notifications disabled on your phone for a specific app to ensure it doesn’t show up on the watch as well. Surely that can’t be the case? That’s the stupidest thing I’ve heard in a while.",97

zandy0,GarminWatches,3,[How Do I Set Up Which Notifications Display on My Garmin Device?](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=TLeDN92ZU0AgN4df6HakwA),12
zandy0,GarminWatches,4,I have an iPhone unfortunately. That’s so stupid :( thank you!,11
zandy0,GarminWatches,5,Yes I read that and that’s where I got the impression that in order to avoid getting notifications for a certain app I need to turn it off for my phone as well. I just wanted to make sure I didn’t misunderstand because I think it sounds very clunky to have them be connected like that.,56
zandy0,GarminWatches,6,"On iPhone, you have to configure it on a per-app setting what notifications you get. I think it is Banners that get sent to the watch",26
zandy0,GarminWatches,7,"Turn off the Notification Center alerts, you can keep Lock Screen and Banners on",14
zandy0,GarminWatches,8,Aha! Thank you!,3
zankl3,zoloft,0,How long dit it take to work?,7
zankl3,zoloft,1,"Dear people, I’m with sertraline since august 2022 (anxiety, panic, PTSD). I think it is working…but very slow. Therefore my question: how long dit it take to work? Suddenly or slow?",31
zankl3,zoloft,2,Thanks in advance for your feedback🙂,6
zankl3,zoloft,3,2 to 6 weeks,4
zankl3,zoloft,4,25mg currently. Third day I had windows of time where that heavy cloud was lifted. That feeling became more frequent as the days went on taking Zoloft.,27
zankl3,zoloft,5,"What dosage are you on? I'm nearly 7 weeks into 50mg, can't tell if it's working or not 😅",19
zankl3,zoloft,6,I've been on it since August as well. It has worked... but by like 10%. I'll take whatever improvement I get though.,22
zankl3,zoloft,7,9 weeks before first improvements.,5
zankl3,zoloft,8,About 3-4 weeks for me. I moved up doses to 100mg within 3 weeks though because I was dealing with severe panic disorder. Most people don’t up their dose as quickly as I did.,34
zankl3,zoloft,9,I got immediate calming effect. And that’s pretty much stayed with me since day 1. I on and off feel happier and I’m not snapping at people or threatening to call the cops on anyone since I started,38
zankl3,zoloft,10,8 months,2
zankl3,zoloft,11,What dose?,2
zankl3,zoloft,12,"My psychiatrist started me at 50mg four days ago, and wants me to take 100mg from the second week forward. I'm about upping the dosage so quickly. What should I expect?",31
zankl3,zoloft,13,The most side effects I’ve had has been being a little shaky. I also had a little bit of a “floaty” feeling right after I upped the dose. I did a week at 50mg and then a week at 75mg before moving to 100 though. I didn’t go straight from 50 to 100. You could try doing 75 for a few days first.,63
zankl3,zoloft,14,Thank you for replying. My most major side effect has been insomnia. I haven't driven in a month.,18
zankl3,zoloft,15,That’s so rough. I relate. I had awful insomnia for a while too but for me it was because of my panic disorder and OCD flare up since I was having insomnia before getting on Zoloft. Once Zoloft started kicking in it got better. I know insomnia is a common side effect with starting so I’m sure it’ll clear up for you soon!,63
zanp22,Christianity,0,I think I've finally overcame my lustful thinking by changing my mindset,12
zanp22,Christianity,1,"I was addicted to porn and masturbation for some time and I'd always pray for God to help me to stop sexualizing women. I tried forcing asexuality upon myself, but couldn't because I was too attracted to women. I felt like I'd never beat this, but a few days ago I was thinking about how we're all brothers and sisters in Christ and that the women I lust after are my sisters, and I wouldn't be thinking these thoughts about one of my siblings. After this, I stopped feeling attraction toward women and view them all as a sister.",99
zanp22,Christianity,2,[removed],1
zanp22,Christianity,3,"Lol, what that step-sibling crap? I'm thinking of these women in the same way that I think of one of my actual sisters, there's no sexualization in my changed mind.",30

zao2nz,AutisticAdults,0,Just a vent about today.,5
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,1,I had s meltdown today and I feel like ass because of it. I’m home alone all day with no one to talk to but 4 animals who all love to make noise and demand attention. My parents’ dog follows me around and woofs at me if I try to sit alone in my room. My cat can’t be around the other cats and always wants the window open and thumps her tail repetitively against the glass if I don’t open it. My parents’ cat cries if I’m not with him (he doesn’t get along with my cat). I’m constantly overloaded by these animals and I have no energy or patience left to give them what they want. I feel terrible and sad about it but in thr moment I’m always just pissed because I’m so overwhelmed.,137
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,2,Today was already bad. I was trying to work on my social skills but it only made me feel guilty because I was doing well before everything happened and now it feels like I’m at square one. I’ve been trying to spend more time with my parents but I feel like they don’t enjoy my company very much.,58
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,3,I’ve never hit myself or anything during a meltdown but today was bad. My cat kept hitting the window with a very specific and repetitive noise and the dog wanted in my room and the other cats wanted in too and they were crying at my door and I just lost it. I was yelling and hitting the walls with my arms and I still feel like shit because I scared my cat. I always feel so guilty for having them because I know I need to control myself but I can’t.,92
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,4,"It was bound to happen with how stressed I’ve been this entire week, but I just needed to vent. I think things will be better when I’m in school and not sitting around anymore. Thanks for listening.",37
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,5,"Look at it this way, animals? They're forgiving as hell. It's fine to feel a bit guilty but your cat has probably already forgiven you and will come right to you the next time it sees you.",37
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,6,"A meltdown isn't meant to be suppressed, love. It's an important outpouring of emotion and stress. It's going to happen and it's better done sooner rather than later. As soon as you're in a safe space.",36
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,7,What you can do is make it easier. The animals are acting up? Noise cancelling headphones/earplugs or earbuds. They will soon learn they don't control you.,26
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,8,Please be kind to yourself. You deserve it.,8
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,9,You are valid in your feelings. Please cut yourself some slack I know I'd be super on edge from sensory input like that (part of why I haven't gotten a pet yet and also can barely look after myself).,39
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,10,Can you maybe identify anything else that has been stressing you out and limit this? I know my tolerance and fuse gets shorter the more stressors I've had in my life.,31
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,11,If you can try taking an hour or two for yourself where you go in your room and shut/lock the door with the animals on the outside of it. Maybe Just after you feed them so they’re all distracted? And then just put some earplugs or noise canceling headphones in and set your alarm for 1-1.5 hours or even 2 if you need it and just pretend for that time that they don’t exist.,74
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,12,It might sound mean but you can’t take care of them if you don’t take care of yourself. And if they won’t leave you alone themselves you’ll just have to make time without them.,34
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,13,"As a parent, this is my base state. I'm physically repulsed by repetitive sounds and actions, and that's their entire life's purpose right now.",24
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,14,"At this moment there's two children with two tablets playing things I don't want to hear, kicking at me and bouncing off of me, asking me question after question...",29
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,15,When it gets bad I put in my Google Pixel Buds Pro and turn on noise cancellation to get a little distance from the intensity and it's been helping A LOT.,31
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,16,"I love them more than life itself, but... Let's just say, when I was 11 I realized I can't deal with repetition when a neighbor's dog spent all morning barking continuously and I started punching holes in my wall to relieve the feelings building up in me, and this is 100x as frustrating (I never have and never will hit my kids, I instead let it build until I can't and then I go to the bathroom and sit alone or take a bath or something).",86
zao2nz,AutisticAdults,17,"The animals in my house are a huge trigger for me. They over stimulate the shit outta me and if I could go back and not get them, I would. I feel soooo badly about that because they of course deserve to be loved and adored, but after having a kid I just don’t have the energy for them anymore. All my spoons go to my child. Please don’t feel bad. We don’t pick what overstimulates us. You deserve peace ❤️",81

zao9j3,mbti,5,Haha! Um no how do you actually know you are entj?,11
zao9j3,mbti,6,What what,2
zao9j3,mbti,7,"I studied cognitive functions during the summer, why?",8
zao9j3,mbti,8,How much and how do you know you’re te ni?,10
zao9j3,mbti,9,"Are you doubting me?? Jk I doubted myself too for some time. Not for te-fi because I think that’s very obvious to everyone, but I couldn’t decide between estj/entj. 90% of the time I really see the Ni-Se but then I’ll read something about Si to which I can relate to (rarely ever Ne but ig it makes sense cuz it would be tert?). However every time I read estj vs entj descriptions I always relate to the entj and rarely ever anything about the estj. I also have a dad with pretty high Si so I can really see how different we are. I try to study and understand better cognitive functions and stacks every day if I can, whenever I watch movies/read books I always try to notice what functions characters use, then check online and read the comments as a way of ”training the eye”. I have yet a lot to learn, though I believe I know enough to type myself (I have been called overconfident a few times tho so idk lmao). That doesn’t really answer your question but I don’t suppose you want me to describe everything I know about each cognitive function, right?",199
zao9j3,mbti,10,Yes maybe I do hahaha! Also tell me about si blindness I have studied this and very seriously for 3 years.,21
zao9j3,mbti,11,Well if you have then you should explain better what you mean bc I had never heard of it until you mentioned it just now. Are you talking about PoLR?,30
zao9j3,mbti,12,I am. I want you to explain it that confirms things more.,12
zao9j3,mbti,13,Right.. well like I said I don’t know anything about it yet so ig I can’t do that,18
zao9j3,mbti,14,"So maybe I should just type you afresh. It will help you out and you’d learn a lot. If you’re really what you think it will not hert you, if you’re not that will completely retype you.",37
zao9j3,mbti,15,"Sure I have no problem with that, but I am wondering why you’re having such a hard time answering my question. Also why are you so interested in helping me?",30
zao9j3,mbti,16,Because I want to help people find their type also type is much more complex then you have it there.,20
zao9j3,mbti,17,What are your hobbies and why? Please explain each as thoroughly as possible.,13
zao9j3,mbti,18,Also what do you do study or work? If you work what do you do for a living? Do you enjoy it and why? If you study instead what do you study and why do you study this? What is your favorite aspect of your studies? Why? Do you enjoy what you’re studying and why?,55

zaoclk,Mcat,1,long story short I'm currently taking a biochem class and am testing early January.

zaodev,relationship_advice,0,"My(26m) friends (23m 24m 27m) invited me to live with them, but changed up plans after I agreed",18
zaodev,relationship_advice,1,"Back in July I was last minute invited to come live with a group of friends, 5 people in a 4 bedroom because rent was too high. I agreed being told I would have a ground level room and since I have a parrot the sunlight is MUCH needed. Well the week before I moved my belongings one of the original housemates decided she (26f) was moving out and they filled the spot same day. Problem is the new person E (25m) got the room I was supposed to have and I was assigned the corner basement room. Apparently E and one of the housemates (D) are exes and D's current partner (F) does not want them on the same floor (But same house is ok?)",126
zaodev,relationship_advice,2,I have 3 massive artificial lights now for my bird because this room is so far underground there is no sunlight at all :(. I have to play bird videos instead of the birdfeeder I wanted to set up and I just feel so bad for him because he's in this dark basement alone.,54
zaodev,relationship_advice,3,"The group doesn't really seem to care and have explained to me that it's basically tough shit and drop it. I have, but the whole reason I chose to move here was because I was under the impression that I would have a good set up for my parrot.",49
zaodev,relationship_advice,4,"Now I feel that I sound unreasonable and ungrateful yea? Well E is never even home. 80% of the time the room is empty, he spends a lot of time at work and at his partners house and stays there overnight often. I get to look at this beautifully bright empty room every day.",54
zaodev,relationship_advice,5,I am really appreciative about being asked to move in but I am kinda mad that I was tossed aside like that. How should I proceed? I know I should just drop it but I keep feeling slighted about it.,40

zapbs4,NoFap,3,"Your balls hurting is called having blue balls. That happens when fluids (not semen, that's not stored in the balls) accumulate in your balls from being aroused and not releasing. It creates a pressure that hurts. Probably happened because you watched porn. Now you know why you shouldn't do that. The pain might go away on its own but I heard that applying cold helps, or doing squats with a lot of weight (warm your legs up first). Hope you manage. Also, motivation is great and makes things easier but real strength comes from discipline, i.e. being able to do the right thing even if you don't feel like it. So even if you release and don't feel motivated don't take that as an excuse to not do the work. Accept the fact that it just won't be as easy. Hope you manage to hang on and pass your exams!",150

zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,0,Was physically assaulted after being falsely accused by a bar of stealing a bag,14
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,1,Hiya so idk if it’s too late for me to take action but a few months ago I attended a friends birthday party at a bar/club.,26
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,2,"an incident occurred in which my friend (who I was living with at the time) had lost her bag in the bar after becoming incredibly intoxicated, because at the beginning of the night there was cctv footage of me carrying my friends bag for her to our table and I was the only coloured individual with the group the bouncers had assumed that I was a thief and proceeded to hold be in their back rooms for an hour and a half where 3 large men proceeded to intimate me insisting that it was not a racially profiled incident because the manager was black, as I didn’t know what was going on and couldn’t provide them with any information since I hadn’t stolen anything they proceeded to calm that they had thirty cctv footage of me looking through my friends bags and taking things however when I asked to be shown the footage it could not be provided I was eventually let go",163
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,3,"Unbeknownst to me while I was being held by security, there was another bouncer who had gone to my friend (who had lost her bag) and told her that he thought that I had mental health issues, that I was lying to her and that she should find better friends. So when I was eventually released and we all got in our lift to go home she brutally attacked me in the car ripping out clumps of my hair",79
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,4,"In the aftermath the next day she threw all of my things outside into the rain and filled my bags with her dogs poop before spitting on my things resulting in damages to various expensive pieces of technology and I had most of my clothing ruined by the damp, She made various TikTok’s that she eventually took down boasting about the way she had attacked me and she has crippled my social life as she has told anyone that will listen that I’m not a good person and that I’m a thief despite the fact that i was all a misunderstanding and her bad was found in the end with everything still in it",114
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,5,"My life now is a shell of what I used to be, I rally go out because In my small town I am almost always met with dirty looks of comments from individuals who believe the false accusations made against me and I was just hoping that someone on this platform might know of something I can do to Clear my name and get the justice I deserved 🙏🏾",69

zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,27,So you’ve had numerous crimes committed against you here that you should go to the police about.,17
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,28,The first is false imprisonment. The line between citizens arrest and false imprisonment is that obviously debatable but they’ve gone far over it in this case because:,27
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,29,- The crime is not serious.,6
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,30,- There is little evidence you did it. You didn’t have the bag on you.,15
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,31,"- They held you for an hour and a half. You’re only supposed to hold someone until the police arrive. Obviously the police would have arrived much sooner than that or the police would have told them to let you go. Clearly they didn’t even ring the police which means it doesn’t count as a citizens arrest, just false imprisonment.",60
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,32,You should go to the police over this.,8
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,33,You can also put in a civil claim for damages against the company which could give you significant compensation. You’ll probably need a lawyer to pursue a civil claim but may be able to get no win no fee.,39
zaphv4,LegalAdviceUK,34,You can also get their security licences taken away.,9
unknown,unknown,0,Secondly assault. You roommate physically assaulted you. This is a crime. Go to the police and present whatever evidence you have. If you saved her TikToks admitting it it will be an open and shut case (though will still take a long time.),43
unknown,unknown,1,"Thirdly, damaging your stuff. This is criminal damage. Again go to the police with your evidence.",16
unknown,unknown,2,"Lastly the reputational damage. You do have a case that you’ve been lied about and had your reputation damage however pursing such a case through the Courts would be very expensive for you and may be very difficult. My advice would be that once you go to the police you go on social media and tell your side of the story publicly. As long as you tell the truth there should be no legal problems for you in doing this. Name the people involved, name and shame the companies. Lots of people will believe you and sympathise with you. I instantly believed you. The higher ups at the company will probably investigate. Your roommate may attack you again but you will have defenders on your side now and she’s actually likely to say something that incriminates her again.",138
unknown,unknown,3,Hope that helps.,3
zappoq,petco,0,Dog Training Area,3
zappoq,petco,1,People always get mad when I move stuff out of my way or away from my DT Kiosk and idk if its happened to anyone else. We are a small store and the donation bin we use is right next to my kiosk and I wanted to decorate but it was in the way and i had gotten the OK from my GM to move it but one of the other managers got mad? Im talking with my gm about it but does anyone have any similar experiences / what did you do?,93
zappoq,petco,2,You have a donation bin? We were told to get rid of ours due to the unions (weird),18
zappoq,petco,3,"But in response to your question- if your GM is fine with it what the other managers say really doesn’t matter in the long run (coming from the CAL/SEL) It’s not like you got rid of the donation bin, only moved it. If it’s still within sight and reach you didn’t do anything wrong",54
zappoq,petco,4,Yea move that shit,4
zappoq,petco,5,"My DT's training area is their personal space and they are free to do whatever they want to it to make it appealing to them, the pet parents and of course the pets.",33
zappoq,petco,6,The other managers keep putting shut in front of my ring and my display and I literally just move it out of the way and spitefully put it all in front of the register so that way they HAVE to deal with it.,43
zappoq,petco,7,"It was a certain thing that didnt fit in the donation bin, our manager fights our dgm for it (lol) but it was a stand for a cockatiel cage that was literally rught under the kiosk. The people who showcase the cats here didn't take it so i just wanted it out of the way and they were saying its fine there but it's literally my only spot where i can put the kiosk",74
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,0,Current state of wrestling magazines (Pro Wrestling Illustrated etc.)?,9
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,1,"As a kid I was a big fan of PWI and their family of magazines, and would also occasionally end up with one from the George Napolitano publications (theirs were kind of a sloppier, pulpier version of the Apter mags). It was really common to see them at grocery store or drugstore newsstands, all-ages bookstores, etc. back in the late '80s and early '90s.",64
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,2,"I know that Pro Wrestling Illustrated still exists, because the PWI 500 gets talked up on social media every year (if nothing else) but it's been a few years since I've actually seen one at a store (I think Walgreens was the last one?) I know it's not novel to say that print media's been in steep decline for awhile, so it's impressive that PWI is still around at all, but I was curious and figured someone on here probably still bought/read them semi-regularly.",84
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,3,I guess my main questions are:,6
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,4,"1. Is PWI the last one standing, or do they still publish other titles? As mentioned, I've seen PWI for sale at stores a few times in recent years, but I can't remember the last time I saw any other wrestling magazine. From the ""Apter mags"" family or otherwise.",49
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,5,"2. Do they still more or less try to keep kayfabe in their stories? I know on one hand that might seem foolish in the internet age, when there's probably no full-on ""marks"" left of any age, but if they can't compete with the internet (online dirtsheets included) in terms of news and up-to-the-minute commentary, I can see how they might decide to just pick a lane and keep up a winking suspension of disbelief.",75

zapwhj,SquaredCircle,8,So I recently got the PWI 500 magazine and I was rather happy with my purchase. I don’t know of other magazines really. But I liked the product enough that I bought a subscription.,34
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,9,I live with my 68 year old Great uncle who was following wrestling with his dad my great grandfather as kid reading the magazines and stuff. It did still present itself as a kayfabe magazine.,35
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,10,But the big reason for me I got it to connect with an old school fan. And it worked. We’re looking forward to the next issues.,26
zapwhj,SquaredCircle,11,Pretty sure PWI is the sole publication of theirs now.,10

zaqm2o,legaladvice,1,"Hi,",1
zaqm2o,legaladvice,2,"I lived in Missouri some time ago and made my internet payments directly through the landlord included in Rent since the internet was a bundle they had with ATT. Though the online account had my email and name, it always showed $0 and no usage as that was reported to my landlord. When I moved out, I asked my landlord if I was responsible for returning the equipment, or I leave it in the apartment for the next person, and they told me to leave it and they'll take care of it. I got notification months later from ATT saying that I didn't return my equipment. I called the landlord, they were going to return. Never did, so I got ATT sent the debt to a debt collection agency.",129

zaruvo,relationship_advice,17,"Since you have expertise in the hiring process, I would casually offer him help practicing and/or tips. But I wouldn't mention ""because I saw your interview and you are terrible"", more like ""since you are going through something I am knowledgeable in"".",42
zaruvo,relationship_advice,18,It sounds like he has not asked for help.,9
zaruvo,relationship_advice,19,"First of all does he think he has a problem? Second does he want help/get feedback so he recognizes he has a problem? Third, does he want help from you?",30
zaruvo,relationship_advice,20,Get the first question answered first.,6
zaruvo,relationship_advice,21,It sounds like he has anxiety. Lip smacking/mouth wetting is a sign of nervousness. Offer to do mock interviews with him.,21
zaruvo,relationship_advice,22,"Interviewing is a skill that needs to be practiced to get good at it, just like any skill. There’s this interview technique called STAR that he needs to look up. It’s basically like, hey here’s an example of a situation I faced, how I faced it, and what the results were. If he has 10 examples like this and practices/memorizes them, that will help a lot with his confidence. Also, he can look up the most common STAR interview questions and make sure he has examples for each one. I created a spreadsheet and read over it before any interview, just to center myself. For the non stop Ums, you might try recording him during an interview so he can actually hear himself. If you think this would backfire, he can put a little note next to his camera that says No Ums! I did this and it actually helps. The best thing you can do for him is help him with these different tricks so he gains confidence. See if he’ll do mock interviews with you that can can record so he can hear himself and work on fixing issues.",191
zaruvo,relationship_advice,23,"I swear I could have written this post. My fiancé has been job hunting for months and has great experience in his field and a nice resume and he lands multiple interviews a week. But he has yet to be offered a position and I’m almost 100% positive it’s because of how he comes across in interviews. He has a lot of interview anxiety but he tries too hard to play it cool and comes off as disinterested. I’ve tried to encourage him to show his personality and make an attempt to make a personal connection with the interviewer, but he says he likes his method. I’m trying so hard to not damage his confidence but he is also his own biggest problem",123
zaruvo,relationship_advice,24,"I don't see a way for you to bring this up with your fiancé without knocking his confidence, and I think you should leave the overall topic alone until he potentially comes to you for feedback on his own initiative.",40
zaruvo,relationship_advice,25,"If he does come to you by himself, even if only to just vent about unsuccessful interviews, you can remind him of your hiring and managing experience and offer to go over his CV with him and give him some pointers for future interviews.",44
zaruvo,relationship_advice,26,"However, even then, I think you should keep your observations to yourself and just offer good tips based on your own experience. I'm sure you mean well, but I don't think the rest is really for you to judge. You overheard him talking to an interview panel, but you probably weren't supposed to. You're not his hiring agent or manager. You're his girlfriend; your role in this constellation is different and your criticism would likely have an entirely different impact than you intend it.",84
zaruvo,relationship_advice,27,Offer to practice interviews with him. I failed at my first interview because no one told me how to interview and I was way too casual and familiar and nervous,30
zaruvo,relationship_advice,28,"I’d say hey I saw a really great YouTube or TikTok about interviewing it made me think about your job hunt. Then 1 give him some external resources, there a ton of great ones on YouTube. Then 2 say they suggest roleplaying an interview and ask if he’d be interested in doing that with you. If he says no leave it alone if he says yes I’d role-play some of the open ended questions that are most typical and at the end ask if he’d like your feedback or constructive criticism then bring up the things you notice.",98
zaruvo,relationship_advice,29,"I don’t think there’s anything wrong with helping your partner or wanting them to have their best qualities shine. My partner and I have always helped each other study, done flash cards, role-played for interviews. It’s so helpful to get out the nervous energy.",44

zaruvo,relationship_advice,31,"Help him practice. For my last job, I put in the work for the interview: googled common interview questions, and researched the company, and practiced the interview over the phone with friends and on camera. That’s what it takes. It isn’t that he lacks the skills as to why he isn’t getting hired it’s that he sounds really unprepared.",59
zaruvo,relationship_advice,32,He is your fiancé. Eventually he'll be your husband. Just talk straight with him. It's not what you say. It's how you say it. Keep it positive and constructive. Be supportive and understanding.,33

zaruvo,relationship_advice,35,I say this for someone who has had countless career jumps and needs slapping down more.,16

zaruvo,relationship_advice,37,He's trying to not get a job.,7
zaruvo,relationship_advice,38,Jk. Idk.. But hope you figure it out because that's a delicate issue to try and address.,17
zaruvo,relationship_advice,39,"Yeah, it's tough because I think most people get really nervous for interviews. To be honest, I have even taken a beta blocker beforehand because I was so jittery. Over the years, I've developed a running list of questions I've either been asked or anticipated being asked and the responses to gonwith them. I usually go over those about 5 times, so I have them in my head but am not over rehearsed. I've even recorded myself asking the questions and filmed myself answering them to get used to it. I think you should go for it if you want to apply to other jobs! Each interview is practice so that even if you don't get a job, you're prepared when the right one comes along!",126
zaruvo,relationship_advice,40,"It definitely takes practice to do, I usually have to rehearse my answers for it to come out smoothly. I have to do it every time otherwise I become awkward again lol! It definitely doesn't come naturally.",37
zaruvo,relationship_advice,41,"If you can get someone to do practice interviews with you, they can be loads of help. (Though it always feels cringy lmao)",23
zaruvo,relationship_advice,42,There is a website called UNIVERSAL CLASS (free through public libraries) that has a course about job interviews. One whole lesson is about practicing for a job interview.,28
zaruvo,relationship_advice,43,This! You don't have to tell him that you actually saw/heard him. When he tells you that he wasn't hired after the interview give some general advice how to handle a job interview. And without him knowing address the problems he seems to be having,45
zaruvo,relationship_advice,44,"Propanolol is actually being marketed on FB as a ""performance "" medication for interviews and public speaking. It's a beta blocker. I take it for tachycardia/rapid heartbeat. I mean it does lower your racing heart and that calms you. I think in his case it's a matter of being out of practice in ""selling himself."" My exhusband had similar trouble decades ago when trying to switch fields. Years later after our divorce he YouTube researched ""how to"" interviews and common questions asked. He has now nailed several very very important awesome jobs. He's a pro at interviews cuz we're roommates now and I hear him on zooms.",107

zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,0,Any advice on the dog that pulls?,7
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,1,"I'm watching a dog that I've watched for a year and a 1/2 now, on and off. She always pulls, because her owners don't do anything about it. They just let her go wherever she wants, and they follow. I hate it. And I have talked to them about it multiple times, they just say thank you and they'll try but it's obvious that haven't.",65
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,2,"I shorten the leash so she's next to me, I give her a treat when she sits next to me, I do everything I've read about, and she doesn't stop. It's gotten to the point where she will pull so hard, that I have to yank on the leash to bring her back. And that seems to make her defiant and do it even more.",65
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,3,"Among other training errors, this is making me seriously consider not wanting to continue our relationship. But the owners are nice, and they treat me well. It's just the dog that is starting to wear on my nerves",38
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,4,[deleted],1
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,5,"I carry my own training harnesses to manage dogs who have leash issues, including pulling. Just check with the owner that it’s ok to use your own harness - I use a PetSafe 3-in-1 in three sizes.",37
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,6,Get a harness with a front clip or a gentle leader (head collar.) You have to get owners approval. That will curb the bad habits quickly,26
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,7,You got yourself and the dog into a feed back loop. You both are pulling each other more and more because you're both not getting what you need in the walk. The dog is pulling more and darting/lunging quicker because to them that's the only way to get more freedom. Less freedom for the dog doesn't mean less pulling and often it just means whoever is stronger pulls harder.,69
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,8,"Walking right next to another entity, dog or human, isn't really natural for dogs. Roaming, zigzagging, and sniffing it how dogs naturally walk. And all thought those are often connected to pulling, pulling is not required for a dog to do those things. A dog can learn or be trained to walk in a heel position but that requires consistent association to reinforcement. Reinforcement can be many things, treats, access for, praise, removal of unpleasant stimuli, and or play (pre-mac principal.) There are benefits and downsides to different reinforcement methods. And it really depends what the dog cares about the most in the moment. If squirrels and smelling is way more important than treats using treats during walks is going to be inefficient.",123
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,9,"Additionally dogs don't generalize training to different handlers easily. Even if the pet parents started training and were diligent, you would not see an effect for some time.",28
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,10,"My recommendation and suggestion for you is to either decline walking them, or work on better walking communication between you and the dog. Not every dog works well with every persons walking style and vice versa. I would recommend looking into loose leash walking methods. I walk many dogs that just need a little more space to roam, safely, to then start actually paying attention to where I wanted to walk.",71
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,11,I have a doggo like this and unfortunately has a pace maker so cannot use anything around his neck so he wears a harness.,24
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,12,"I use a lead that has a little pull elastic in it, I think it’s a no pull lead. When we’re out walking I usually figure if 8 back and forth up and down my garden. He is much better with me but because of his pace maker I’ve had to put in the work as I’m not as confident to let him pull.",64
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,13,Patience is a virtue unfortunately but perhaps make the owners aware of the harm it does to you physically also and how you don’t know if you can continue without some co operation.,33
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,14,"Like previous people have said try a harness with the owner's approval. Use treats. Get her attention on you before you go on the walk. Have her sit, look at you. Maybe do a few recalls, anything to kind of get her calmed down and more focused on you than the walk. Even if it's just for a moment it will help during the walk.",65

zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,19,"Not sure how quickly the dog will learn, but with my clients who do this, as soon as they pull too hard I stop walking completely. Usually the dog is like ??? When there's slack we keep going. Most dogs figure it out enough that walking with me specifically + pulling = not going anywhere. It's not a long term solution but it'll save you some pulled muscles.",68
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,20,Get the lead that pulls from the front of the dog as others have mentioned.,15
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,21,"Training takes a lot of repetition. Every time the dog pulls on the lead I stop. I walk forward when they are calm and praise them. If they pull again I stop. And again and again. You have to continue this even if it takes a long time and they start to realise they don't go anywhere unless they stop pulling. But for the time restrictions of walking on Rover and your main purpose being to exercise the dog not train it, I would opt for the lead if the owners approve.",92
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,22,"I swear by Weiss walkie leashes. My own dogs are horrible pullers on walks and they still pull, but it does lessen it a lot more than any other leash we've tried. I use it on one of my regulars too (with permission) and she pulls so much less!",49
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,23,"Unfortunately, there's not a lot else you can do without the owner's approval. I would recommend having another very serious conversation with the owners where you essentially say, ""Look, if you don't do something about this - such as hiring a trainer or purchasing tools like a prong collar - I will be terminating this relationship as it has gotten completely out of hand."" And if they don't do anything, follow through on it and terminate the relationship.",78
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,24,See if owners would be interested in getting a prong or gentle leader. I've seen the gentle leaders work magic with pullers!,22
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,25,"My dog used to pull and the only thing that helped was lots and lots of leash corrections. What I do is slightly tug the leash or just allow the dog to catch the end of the leash and then head in the opposite direction. Eventually she got the idea that the only way to actually move forward on the walk is to stay by me. I had to accept the fact that I might not get very far physically during the walk, but my dog is usually still pretty worn out from having to pay attention to what she is doing. Overall it can take a lot of effort to break a pulling habit, but might be worth it in the long run if you plan to see the dog on a continual basis.",135
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,26,"I can handle her since she's a smaller dog, it's just the biggest issue for me is walking. One time, we passed by someone, and they said, ""Who's walking who?"" which was embarrassing.",33
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,27,"She also sometimes doesn't listen, which is weird bc she used to be good abt it before. I'm not sure what's happened, maybe bc she's almost 3, and these behaviors have set in with her owners, and I handle it differently. Our she doesn't like my style.",47
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,28,"I told them she's not listening to me as much, and they just said it was weird since she listens to them. Maybe it's a respect thing?",27
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,29,But i see your point. I wonder if charging more would make it worth it.,15
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,30,"Thank you for the recommendation, I will see what they say. Her harness now has no front clip, so I think that also contributes. I always use the front clip with other dogs who pull or are leash aggressive.",39
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,31,"Thank you, I will talk to them.",7
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,32,"Thank you for the suggestion, I hadn't heard of loose leash walking. I will research and try it.",18
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,33,"I see the dog almost every month for housesitting. These ppl got a dog in covid, hadn't had a dog since they were young, and they'd only had cats. And it'd been like 10 years since they had any pets.",40
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,34,"Now that everything's been lifted, they travel as often as they used to before the dog. Once or twice a month, for at least 5 days. I'm currently almost done with a 3-week stay. And they leave for another trip next week 🙃",43
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,35,They canceled two long trips next year bc they're realizing they don't want to leave their dog so often... it's the classic covid dog issues that we all hear and read abt.,32
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,36,"And the jumping when on walks omg. I've walked other dogs in their neighborhood, and when I come across them, sue jumps to see me, and the owners barely stop it. I always try, and they get the hint to stop her.",42
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,37,[deleted],1
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,38,>I wonder if charging more would make it worth it.,10
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,39,Know your worth girl. I think we have all gone through a phase of really horrible dogs for the sake of building up clientele lol. Growing your business also means making hard choices that will put you ahead not behind.,40
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,40,What if that really well trained Labrador down the street needs walking while you're waisting time with Little Miss Yanks My Arm Off? It's hard to let go of bad relationships but you would be making way for better business opportunities. It's that or up the rate to make it worth your while. The whole point of Rover is the ability to do what you love. Good luck!,68
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,41,"Omg I walk a dog with a front clip harness and he will use it to drag me *backward*. He’s not obese since I’ve been walking him almost daily for a few months, so he’s not as bad now, but trust me when I say: any lead can suck with the wrong dog! 😂",54
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,42,"I’m currently doing drop ins with a 9 month old puppy who wasn’t trained (so much biting and jumping and pulling at the meet and greet) and after the first drop-in, I brought my dog’s extra Halti (like a gentle leader), because this puppy’s normal collar fits weird (it slides down her neck and gives her a lot of leverage to choke herself 😞). She clearly hated it at first, but wow, so much less pulling, because it’s easier to get her to notice with even a little tension at the top of her neck (that’s the most important thing), and she’ll let up on the leash. If I had a slip lead, I’d prefer that for her (the portion around her muzzle annoys her, and she is very easy to train, so she really just needs biofeedback—even a martingale collar would do wonders), but I don’t recommend slip leads to everyone, because there’s a steep learning curve (though I really like them as a general use training leash).",169
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,43,"The best advice I have that isn’t tool-based (because imo, people do expect too much from the tool vs how you use it): pull up, not back, on the leash for pullers. You want better biofeedback for pullers, and that means higher on the neck—both safer for them and less annoying for you.",53
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,44,Or you can just say you’re more comfortable using a harness and just make sure it has a front clip. A gentle leader will require way more training bc the dogs hate wearing it on their head in the beginning and most owners will think the head collar is hurting their pet(from my experience.),54
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,45,Yep I am very familiar with Covid puppies! Loose leash walking is a broad term and there are different styles. But the main factor is the leash is not what's controlling the dog. The leash is just a secondary safety.,40
zat6vm,RoverPetSitting,46,"Covid puppies are prone to overstimulation or over arousal that causes zoomies and over excitement behavior. Doing a snaifari, decompression, or mental exercise is really good for them. Here is a video of a sniffari. (I am not familiar with this company/group. Literally just did a search for sniffari example.)",50
unknown,unknown,0,You don't have to have a long leash it just has to be long enough that it doesn't get tight when they are roaming.,24
unknown,unknown,1,Additionally if you see them do these signs,8
unknown,unknown,0,"and or shakeouts, their behavior maybe from stress, or over stimulation.",11
unknown,unknown,1,"Oh, completely agree. They likely wouldn't even get a herm-springer or a properly fitted prong.",15
unknown,unknown,2,Thanks. I appreciate the comment. My sister said the same thing lol.,12
unknown,unknown,3,"It's surprising bc she's been good before, so I assume it's the owners that have either encouraged whatever behavior (their neighbor said hi but she didn't want the dog to come to her bc [owner] can't control her when she jumps), or the dog just doesn't like me as kuch as before.",52
unknown,unknown,4,"You're right tho, I have been picking up more business that is closer to where I live, and these ppl are further away. It sucks driving more than I'd like.",30
unknown,unknown,5,"The video you posted is, at the very least, from an certified fear-free trainer and behavior consultant. Her information is right in line with other such accredited professionals.",28
unknown,unknown,6,"My most regular client was a puller. In addition to loose leash walking training I also got permission from her owner to use a long line for her walks. Now that she gets to spend 50-75% of her walks making her own choices and smelling just about anything she wants her owner has told me she's become a loose leash champ when being walked by her family (this is still a relative term, she still pulls sometimes, but far less than she used to). She's still on a front-clip harness unless we're in a big open area, otherwise I do a lot of active management of the long line. My gear is a 15' biothane long line by Viper, which stays stink-free and has durable brass hardware.",127
unknown,unknown,7,"As someone who has had to educate clients on prongs, they definitely won't. I worked with a trainer using one for my husky mix who was a notorious puller so I know my way around them. Had one lab drag its owner across my front yard when getting dropped off the first time, the prong was a necklace. Loose and down around the base of the neck, not doing a damn thing. Thankfully he was receptive on pick-up when I offered to show him how to properly fit it, and where it should rest, etc. When she was dropped off the next time it was still correctly fitted! Though she still dragged him across the yard....because he had switched to using a flexi-lead ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) There's only so much I'm willing to put the energy into fixing and since this dog was happy with just yard time I let it go.",150

If not, don't worry I won't beat anyone with a Jesus stick or anything (a poor attempt at humor :). I would love to explore phycology, past traumas and personal development. To be honest I love talking about most things. I'm very new to this platform. Please send me a private message if you are interested.",106

zavf4q,raisedbynarcissists,0,I feel guilty for missing my dad,7
zavf4q,raisedbynarcissists,1,"So growing up, I was pretty much the GC, inasmuch as there was one. My dad was always really awful to my older brother, but I didn’t find out how awful until recently. He was never a good father, even to me, but we usually got along well when I played his games. I feel disgusted with myself for having a pleasant relationship with him when he was abusing my brother.",71

zavu6q,CarsIndia,2,"I'm new to the car market and have little idea about cars, what i know comes from youtube.",18
zavu6q,CarsIndia,3,I am looking to buy a car under 10 lakh (on road),12
zavu6q,CarsIndia,4,I live alone and majorly will be using this to commute to office (20kms up down) and some casual rides with friends within the city,25
zavu6q,CarsIndia,5,I live in Noida and I would prefer to get the top variant or the variant below it,18
zavu6q,CarsIndia,6,"I am a bit inclined towards Tata &amp; Hyundai, but am open to suggestions",14
zavu6q,CarsIndia,7,So far my top 2 preferences are,7
zavu6q,CarsIndia,8,TATA TIAGO NRG,3
zavu6q,CarsIndia,9,HYUNDAI I20 SPORTZ PETROL,4
zavu6q,CarsIndia,10,Which one should i go for? Also any other suggestions are welcome,12
zavu6q,CarsIndia,11,Hey! Welcome to the club,5
zavu6q,CarsIndia,12,"If safety is your first priority, you should hands down go for Tata however, their after sales service isn’t up to the mark & their have been numerous cases of service centres just not being upto the mark.",38
zavu6q,CarsIndia,13,"Otherwise, you can also try out the Grand I10 Nios, you’d probably get the top end model within 10L.",19
zavu6q,CarsIndia,14,"You can also check out Maruti Baleno or Ignis ( Both sold through NEXA outlets), Maruti is high on mileage & great service centre coverage however, safety is a concern here.",31
zavu6q,CarsIndia,15,I hope you find what you’re looking for! All the best,11
zavu6q,CarsIndia,16,Since you live in Noida I'm assuming that roads are good.. why not get the 4th gen Honda City. It would be a little over your budget but that car is much better than any other in that budget. You get a spacious car with a great engine and good safety ratings .,53
zavu6q,CarsIndia,17,Citroën C3 turbo top end,5
zavu6q,CarsIndia,18,Why not Tiago ev?,4
zavu6q,CarsIndia,19,You can also check ignis if you are okay with it's looks,12
zavu6q,CarsIndia,20,"I20 facelift launching next year so buying now will make no sense no resale value.Tata is boring considering interiors and features for 2022,check Baleno 2022 it has good resale value and features are top notch.",35
zavu6q,CarsIndia,21,Bro if your budget is 10lakhs then you can ho for Kia Sonet Htk+ petrol variant it is a best in segment car under 10 lakhs and personally i am using it for 1.5 years,35
zavu6q,CarsIndia,22,Would you recommend the i10 nios over the i20 sportz variant?,11
zavu6q,CarsIndia,23,"Not really preferring maruti due to the same reason you mentioned, safety.",12
zavu6q,CarsIndia,24,Why shouldn't safety be the first priority?,7
zavu6q,CarsIndia,25,\++,1
zavu6q,CarsIndia,26,I live in a pg so charging the ev at home is not going to be possible and it's not worth charging from those fast charging stations because they take like an hour for full charge,36
zavu6q,CarsIndia,27,Because some times people buy cars with greater mileage & low on safety because their budgets aren’t very high.,19
zavu6q,CarsIndia,28,So savings on mileage will be used for medical treatment if the car gets into an RTA? This mileage logic is exactly why India is not getting safer cars. Majority wants mileage at the expense of safety.,37
zavu6q,CarsIndia,29,If Tata can make affordable safe cars why can't MS and Hyundai?,12
zavu6q,CarsIndia,30,"Hitting the front bumper going at 60kmph is safe. Is that possible in real Iife? Airbags are must, not the star ratings .",23
zavu6q,CarsIndia,31,-5 star rating for your comment.,6
zavu6q,CarsIndia,32,"This is absolute flawed understanding on safety. How are you sure you'll only hit the bumper at 60kmph (how is this even possible, apply some physics) ? Airbags are not the holy grail fool proof saving tool. You have a poorly built structure even airbags won't save you.",48

zax6j5,mentalhealth,0,"I’m a really dependent person, and I hate myself for it.",11
zax6j5,mentalhealth,1,"I feel like I’m the most dependent person in the world, I can’t function by myself anymore. Sometimes when I lie awake at night I sit in my head, and wonder if everything I’ve told myself is a lie. Has orange always been my favorite color, or is it because it was my dad’s favorite color. Have I always hated pink starbursts or is it because it was your favorite and I was happy to give it to you. Did I never tell anyone for years what happened, or is it because I never wanted to believe you did it and would rather think I made it up in my head. Was my favorite flavor lemon, or was it because you never wanted the lemon flavored candy. My hobbies depended on whatever you liked, and I’d research it for hours, just to talk to you about it. Everything I did depended on who I was closest to. If they were happy I was content. But when they were upset I couldn’t give them space, I felt like if they were away I’d lose them forever. I couldn’t stop talking and saying sorry even when I wasn’t wrong, because I just can’t go without talking. I can’t go without hearing an I love you or an I’m not mad at you, just please don’t be mad at me. My mom accidentally texted me and said I was being a bitch, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe, and I couldn’t stop the tears. I got homeschooled because I felt like everyone hated me, because one person didn’t like me. I couldn’t deal with not having at least one person constantly with me. I couldn’t be alone, why can’t I ever just be content alone. I have to have someone all the time, I don’t need them to take care of me, I just need someone to feel like I exist. When I’m alone I can’t exist as a person, I feel lost. I put everything into one person, I just have to have one person. I put everything on hold for them, I live and breathe for them. I know it isn’t right, I can admit it but I just can’t fix it no matter how hard I try. I don’t know how I feel, someone has to feel for me. I wonder if I’m crazy, or if others feel this way too. I just can’t be alone, and I don’t mean I have to be dating someone, it can be my mother, my sibling, or a friend even, it’s not in a romantic way, I just have to have someone. Am I crazy?",443

zax6j5,mentalhealth,4,"I have experienced this. The word for it is codependency if you are willing to accept that label. I've often wondered the same about my preferences, but it goes deeper than that. It's looking for feedback and emotional healing from those around you rather than trusting yourself. Could have a lot to do with self-esteem, trauma and emotional abuse like in my case or you could have completely different causes. My point is, find out what those things are and address them. This is not an easy thing to work on, but you can do it. There are a lot of materials, books, and groups around these issues. If you need direct links, just ask. Hoping everything works out for you.",121
zax6j5,mentalhealth,5,You're not alone.,3
zax6j5,mentalhealth,6,"I feel a similar way too, I've called them my ""best friend in phases of my life"" they were people I stuck with because I liked them, I liked them so much I wanted to be more like them. I ended up basing a lot of my likes, opinions and personality based on them. It feels like I don't really have an original thought and I'm constantly changing based on who I'm with.",73
zax6j5,mentalhealth,7,"But I think that's just a part of being human, we grow up depending on one another to figure things out, we end up mimicking things others do and pouring hours into similar hobbies that they like. It becomes sort of a nurtured hobby I guess? But I think it's all a part of discovering things you like?? And aspects of others that you resonante with? I think who we are as individuals is a mix of all the people were close to and attach ourselves to.",87
zax6j5,mentalhealth,8,"I don't think you're crazy, I can relate to the anxiety of people not liking you and the paranoia of the world hating you. It sucks, but there are people around you who are obviously supporting you (like your mom and siblings,) and if you want to start a journey of being less dependant then I think you can talk to them about it and let them guide you (counterintuitive bc you need to depend on them to help you be more independent but I think it's okay)",88
zax6j5,mentalhealth,9,"Whilst there's a lot to say, perhaps this may help most. You say you put everything into one person, make that person yourself. It's your life and you're living with yourself until the end, no one else will be doing that. Be single and learn to love yourself",48
zax6j5,mentalhealth,10,I feel like you just described exactly how am feel.,10
zax6j5,mentalhealth,11,Another things I to question weather at I am a nice person and do things to be nice or if I’m actually selfish because when am do nice things it makes me feel good and seeing other poeole happy makes me feel good so <i feel like I’m really just doing it for myself. I feel like this comes with the fact that my emotins are so tied to thise around me and IÍm dependent upon their happiness. I hate it but <I also donńt know how to change.,89
zax6j5,mentalhealth,12,Try do figure out what you like. You have to learn to like being around your self more somehow. Play a video game you are interested in or explore something you may like,33
zax6j5,mentalhealth,13,"I have cptsd from sexual and emotional abuse, and I thought maybe it stemmed from it. I went to an advocacy center as a kid and they told me it was minor DID symptoms, but people I’ve talked to who have DID experience symptoms completely different than me. I feel misdiagnosed. I just wanna get better at learning myself, and understanding how to cope. ❤️❤️",65
zax6j5,mentalhealth,14,Thank you❤️❤️,2
zax6j5,mentalhealth,15,"Awesome! Same! I think DID is unlikely just statistically. I definitely qualify for a dissociative diagnosis though, which maybe you have experienced. That includes flashbacks and out of body experiences or a state of complete confusion where you can't center yourself in your identity and whether reality is present or you're in a dream. For me that part can be really scary. I'm saying all this because working on my codependency has really helped with the anxiety that causes a cascading effect of other symptoms. I hope that information is helpful and you feel supported. Hopefully some others comment as well.",101
zaxht7,AskDocs,0,8 year old with jaw/under ear swelling,7
zaxht7,AskDocs,1,"My son had a strep and double ear infection one month ago. Had him on amoxicillin for 2 days before he lost it and refused to take it anymore (ADHD)- his symptoms improved so we regrettably let it slide. He came home yesterday not feeling well, had a temp of 101.7 and there was swelling near the back of his right jaw and under his right ear. This morning, still had a temp of 101, swelling, and complained of ear pain- started him back on amoxicillin last night (new script from an NP I work with). Gave him Tylenol around 7am today, no fever or pain as of now (3pm), but that area is swollen, red l, and warm to the touch. He said his teeth don't hurt at all and he just had a dental check up 3 weeks ago. Was going to wait until tomorrow to see how it is before we rank up more bills at urgent care, but I'm worried about the swelling. Could this be caused by an ear infection or more serious, like something residual from strep? He is fully vaccinated, was panicking about mumps when I first saw him yesterday.
